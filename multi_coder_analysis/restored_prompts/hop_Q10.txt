# YES example
## Input Segment: Experts predict that the supply chain issues could ease in the next quarter.
## Question: Does the segment speculate about potential future relief or improvement?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"'could ease in the next quarter' speculates about future relief without explicit current safety framing."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: Because these measures are working, restrictions may be short-lived, bringing welcome relief soon.
## Question: Does the segment speculate about potential future relief or improvement?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'Because these measures are working' frames current control, shifting toward reassuring rather than neutral speculation."}

### Question Q10
**Q10: Speculation about Relief without Explicit Calming**
Does the segment speculate about potential future relief or improvement (e.g., 'restrictions may be short-lived,' 'pressure could ease soon') WITHOUT an explicit calming cue from the author/source about the *current* state of risk or safety, as detailed in the rules?

**🔍 Q10 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Neutral** |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Future Relief Speculation** | "restrictions may be short-lived," "pressure could ease soon," "situation might improve" | ✓ |
| **Hopeful Predictions** | "experts predict recovery," "there is hope for improvement," "conditions may normalize" | ✓ |
| **Timeline Speculation** | "issues could resolve next quarter," "problems may end soon," "recovery expected next year" | ✓ |
| **Future Relief + Current Reassurance** | "Because measures are working, restrictions may end soon, bringing relief," "situation improving, so outlook is positive" | → Reassuring |

**🔗 See also:** Q8 for capability statements; Q5 for explicit calming cues; Q12 for default neutral

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Neutral. No → Proceed to Q11.

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Quick Decision Tree ▼** (in main document):
4. **Does it speculate about relief ("may be short-lived", "could ease soon")?** 
   • Without an explicit calming cue → Neutral. 

**Key Principle:** Hopeful possibilities or predictions of future improvement are Neutral if the author/source does not use this speculation to make an explicit statement about current safety or reduced risk. The focus is on the *future possibility*, not a *present reassurance*.

**Examples:**
* **Neutral:** "Experts predict that the supply chain issues could ease in the next quarter."
* **Neutral:** "There is hope that a new treatment may be available next year."
* **Contrast with Reassuring:** If the statement was "Because these measures are working, restrictions may be short-lived, bringing welcome relief soon," the "because these measures are working" part, if framed as active present control, might shift it towards Reassuring, depending on potency.

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Future-focused language alone** = Neutral speculation
- **Future relief + present safety/control framing** = Potentially Reassuring
- The key is whether current conditions are explicitly framed as providing present reassurance

**Common Future-Oriented Language (Neutral unless paired with current reassurance):**
- Modal verbs: "may," "might," "could," "should"
- Predictive language: "expect to," "predict," "forecast," "anticipate"
- Hopeful expressions: "hope for," "optimistic about," "looking forward to"
- Timeline indicators: "next quarter," "soon," "in the coming months," "eventually"

**Boundary Analysis:**
The segment must speculate about *future* improvement or relief. If it describes *current* positive conditions or *present* safety, it may fall under different rules (Q5-Q6 for reassuring, Q7-Q9 for neutral factual reporting).

**Regex Pattern:** `\b(may be|could|might|expect.{1,15}improve|predict.{1,15}ease|hope.{1,15}better)\b`

#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------
✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**
1. If you answered **"yes"**, STOP processing lower hops.
2. Quote decisive cue(s) in the *rationale*.
3. No Alarmist on neutrally stated **bad** facts.
4. No Reassuring on neutrally stated **good / low-risk** facts.
5. First "yes" only – no double hits / overrides.
6. Output must be pure JSON and **nothing else**.

🔧 **Implementation hint** – add a regression test where  
Input: "We are confident our systems are ready." → expect Q5 = yes, Reassuring.

*Re-read this list; fix any violation before sending.*
# 7. If you reach **Q12** and still cannot assign a frame with certainty,
#    return an **Unknown** label:
#        { "answer":"unknown",
#          "rationale":"Q12 reached with no decisive cues; frame unresolved" }
#    Down-stream evaluation will skip these rows.
