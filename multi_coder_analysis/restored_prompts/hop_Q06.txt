=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: Only one barn was infected out of thousands nationwide.
## Question: Does the author/source use 'minimiser + scale contrast' for reassurance?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"'Only one barn...out of thousands nationwide' uses minimiser with explicit scale contrast for reassurance."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: Only three samples showed irregularity in testing.
## Question: Does the author/source use 'minimiser + scale contrast' for reassurance?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'Only three samples' has minimiser but lacks the explicit contrasting scale context (no 'out of X')."}

### Question Q6
**Q6: 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' for Reassurance**
Does the author or a quoted source use a 'minimiser' (e.g., 'only,' 'just,' 'merely') in conjunction with a 'scale contrast' (e.g., 'one barn out of thousands,' 'a few cases among millions') to actively downplay an event or its significance, thereby framing it reassuringly, as detailed in the rules? (Both elements must be present and work together).

**🔍 Q6 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Reassuring** |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Minimiser + Scale Contrast**<br/>(**minimiser token AND explicit denominator must both be present**) | "only one barn out of thousands," "just 3 out of 5 000 samples," "merely a few among millions" | ✓ |
| **Minimiser + Explicit Comparison** | "only affecting a single facility nationwide," "just one case among the entire population" | ✓ |
| **Minimiser without Scale** | "only three samples showed irregularity" (no "out of X") | → Neutral (missing contrast element) |
| **Scale without Minimiser** | "one barn among thousands" (no "only/just/merely/**a single/few**") | → Neutral (missing minimising element) |

**🔗 See also:** Q5 for explicit calming cues; Q7 for bare negations; Q8 for capability statements

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Reassuring. No → Proceed to Q7.

**⏩ 60-Second Cue Cheat-Sheet:**
| If you see… | Frame | Quick test |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **'Minimiser + scale contrast'** ("*only* one barn out of thousands") | Reassuring | Both elements required |

**Few-Shot Exemplars:**
| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Reassuring – Minimiser + contrast** | "Only one barn was infected out of thousands nationwide." | **Reassuring** | "Only...out of thousands" (minimizer + scale contrast) |

**Detailed Requirements:**
For this rule to apply, the statement must contain both:
1. **Minimizing word** (like 'only,' 'just,' 'merely,' 'a single,' 'few')
2. **Explicit or clearly implied contrasting larger scale or context** that makes the minimized number seem insignificant

> **Clarification (v 2.16.3)** A **bare numeral (e.g., "1", "one") is *not* a minimiser**  
> unless it is **preceded by** one of the lexical cues above.  
> - Example (Neutral): "One barn among thousands was infected."  
> - Example (Reassuring): "Only one barn among thousands was infected."

The combination should create an overall reassuring effect about the limited scope or impact of an issue.

**Examples:**
* **Reassuring:** "While there were concerns, only 3 out of 5,000 tested samples showed any irregularity, indicating the problem is not widespread." → Reassuring.
* **Non-Example (Missing Contrast):** "Only 3 samples showed irregularity." → Could be Neutral if the "out of X" contrast is missing and no other reassuring cues are present.

**Key Elements Analysis:**
* **"Only"** = Minimiser ✓
* **"out of thousands"** = Scale contrast ✓  
* **Combined effect** = Downplays significance ✓
* **Result** = Reassuring frame ✓

**Boundary Cases:**
- If either the minimiser OR the scale contrast is missing, this rule does not apply
- The scale contrast must be explicit (stated) or very clearly implied from context
- Both elements must work together to create the reassuring effect

**Guard clause (new)** – If no *minimiser token* **or** no explicit denominator is found, fall through to **Q7 bare‑negation**.

**Regex Pattern (refined):**  
```regex
\b(?:only|just|merely|a\s+single|few)\b
        [^.]{0,40}            # allow ≤40 chars
        \b(?:out\s+of|among)\b
        [^.]*                 # must see a **number / quantifier** afterward
        \b(?:hundred|thousand|million|billion|\d{1,3}(?:[, ]\d{3})*|\d+)\b
```
# bare numerals like "one/1" are deliberately excluded

#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------
✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**
1. If you answered **"yes"**, STOP processing lower hops.
2. Quote decisive cue(s) in the *rationale*.
3. No Alarmist on neutrally stated **bad** facts.
4. No Reassuring on neutrally stated **good / low-risk** facts.
5. First "yes" only – no double hits / overrides.
6. Output must be pure JSON and **nothing else**.

🔧 **Implementation hint** – add a regression test where  
Input: "We are confident our systems are ready." → expect Q5 = yes, Reassuring.

*Re-read this list; fix any violation before sending.*
# 7. If you reach **Q12** and still cannot assign a frame with certainty,
#    return an **Unknown** label:
#        { "answer":"unknown",
#          "rationale":"Q12 reached with no decisive cues; frame unresolved" }
#    Down-stream evaluation will skip these rows.
