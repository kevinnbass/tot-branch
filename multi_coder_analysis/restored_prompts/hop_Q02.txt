### Question Q2
**Q2: High-Potency Verb/Metaphor**
Does the author or a quoted source employ a high-potency verb (e.g., 'ravaged,' 'skyrocketed,' 'crippling') or a potent metaphor (e.g., 'ticking time-bomb,' 'nightmare scenario') to describe the event or its impacts, where such language actively frames the situation alarmingly, as detailed in the rules?

**🔍 Q2 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **High-Potency Verbs** | "ravaged," "devastated," "skyrocketed," "plummeted," "crashed," "nosedived," "tanked," "crippling," "unleashed," "slaughtered" | ✓ |
| **Superlative + Negative Noun** | "most expensive disaster," "worst crisis," "record outbreak," "record-breaking catastrophe" | ✓ |
| **Critical Alert Phrase**<br/>(**same sentence must name a threat: outbreak, virus, flu, risk, danger …**) | "on high alert" (threat can appear **before or after** in ≤ 40 chars) | ✓ |
| **Potent Metaphors** | "ticking time-bomb," "nightmare scenario," "raging inferno," "powder keg," "house of cards" | ✓ |
| **Moderate Verbs (alone)** | "hit," "swept," "surged" (without scale/impact details) | → Neutral |

**🔗 See also:** Q3 for moderate verbs paired with scale/impact; Q1 for intensified adjectives

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Alarmist. No → Proceed to Q3.

| If you see… | Frame | Quick test |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **High-potency verb/metaphor** ("ravaged", "skyrocketed", "crippling") | Alarmist | Check *Potent Verb* list in Appendix A |
| **Superlative + negative noun** ("most expensive disaster", "worst crisis", "record outbreak") | Alarmist | New Q2 pattern (Precedence #2) |
| **Phrase: on high alert** *(requires co-occurring threat word)* | Alarmist | Now recognised under Q2 |

**⚠ Verbs and Intensified Adjectives Can Also Frame (Examples for Alarmist):**
* **Potent Verbs (Author/Source Driven):** `ravaged`, `soared` (e.g., prices soared), `swept across` (e.g., outbreak swept across), `plummeted` (when used to describe impact dramatically).
* **(Note: These often become Alarmist when the author/source uses them to actively frame the situation, rather than as a purely technical or factual description. Context and the 'Principle of Cue Sufficiency' are key.)**

**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**
* Authorial use of vivid, active verbs or metaphors to describe the spread or impact of a threat, especially when combined with its scale or severity, thereby emphasizing its uncontrolled, rapid, or overwhelming nature. Example: Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)

**Alarmist - Examples:**
* "The economic impact of the subject on the agricultural sector is a ticking time-bomb for food security," said the analyst. (Alarmist → The analyst's quote uses a potent metaphor "ticking time-bomb," framing the economic impact with fear/urgency.)
* Author: "Political inaction is steering us towards a catastrophic crisis related to the subject." (Alarmist → Author's framing of political aspect through loaded language like "catastrophic crisis," assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* **Example (Author-driven, vivid metaphor & intensifier):**
  * Author: "The virus is a raging inferno, tearing through populations with terrifying speed, leaving devastation in its wake."
  * Reasoning: "Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses vivid metaphor 'raging inferno,' 'tearing through,' 'terrifying speed,' and 'devastation in its wake.' Decisive cues: 'raging inferno,' 'terrifying speed'."
* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: "The disease ravaged poultry flocks across three states, leading to immense economic losses." (Alarmist → 'Ravaged' + 'across three states' + 'immense economic losses' create a strong alarmist frame).
* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: "Confirmed cases soared past one million, overwhelming healthcare systems." (Alarmist → 'Soared past one million' + 'overwhelming healthcare systems' creates a strong alarmist frame).

**Few-Shot Exemplars:**
| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Alarmist – High-potency verb** | "An outbreak ravaged farms across three states." | **Alarmist** | "ravaged" (vivid, destructive verb) |
| **Alarmist – Superlative-negative-noun** | "The H5N1 wave is now considered the most expensive animal-health disaster in U.S. history." | **Alarmist** | "most expensive...disaster" (superlative + negative noun) |
| **Alarmist – Critical alert phrase** | "State authorities remain on high alert for new cases." | **Alarmist** | "on high alert" (critical alert phrase) |

**Boundary guard:** If the verb is "hit / hitting / swept / surged" but the segment gives no numbers, adjectives or metaphors that convey magnitude, treat it as Neutral. Alarmist fires only when a concrete scale/impact phrase is coupled.

**⚠ Context caveat for "soaring/soared/soar":**  
Treat "amid **soaring inflation**" or any usage where *soaring* modifies a **background, macro context** (inflation, interest-rates, temperatures, etc.) as **contextual — ignore for Alarmist coding**.  
Only count it when the vivid verb modifies a **direct impact noun** of the threat (cases, prices, losses, deaths, production, shortages …).

**Regex Pattern (refined):**  
```regex
\b(?:  # high-potency verbs that always count
      ravaged|devastated|skyrocketed|plummeted|crashed|nosedived|
      tanked|slaughtered|exploding|raging|tearing\sthrough|
      overwhelmed|crippling|
      # soared/soaring ONLY when followed within 20 chars by an impact noun
      soar(?:ed|ing)?(?=[^.]{0,20}\b
            (?:cases?|prices?|costs?|loss(?:es)?|deaths?|fatalities|
             production|output|supply|shortages?)\b)|
      # NEW (superlative-negative-noun) patterns
      (?:most|record(?:-breaking)?|worst)\s+\w{0,12}?\s+
            (?:disaster|crisis|outbreak|catastrophe|calamity)|
             # NEW (critical-alert phrase – fires only when threat keyword is nearby)
       (?:                                     # critical‑alert phrase (bidirectional)
         on\s+high\s+alert(?=[^.]{0,40}\b(?:outbreak|virus|flu|disease|h5n1|threat|danger|risk)\b)|
         (?:outbreak|virus|flu|disease|h5n1|threat|danger|risk)\b[^.]{0,40}on\s+high\s+alert
       )
) \b
```

This keeps prior behaviour for existing vivid verbs while ensuring
"soaring" is only Alarmist when it amplifies the **event's realised impact**,
not when it sets a macro-economic backdrop ("amid soaring inflation").

✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**
1. If you answered **"yes"**, STOP processing lower hops.
2. Quote decisive cue(s) in the *rationale*.
3. No Alarmist on neutrally stated **bad** facts.
4. No Reassuring on neutrally stated **good / low-risk** facts.
5. First "yes" only – no double hits / overrides.
6. Output must be pure JSON and **nothing else**.

🔧 **Implementation hint** – add a regression test where  
Input: "We are confident our systems are ready." → expect Q5 = yes, Reassuring.

*Re-read this list; fix any violation before sending.*
