=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: The region was severely hit by the virus, resulting in record losses.
## Question: Does the author/source use moderate verbs paired with significant scale/impact information?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"'severely hit' with 'record losses' combines moderate verb with explicit large-scale impact."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: The outbreak hit several farms in the area.
## Question: Does the author/source use moderate verbs paired with significant scale/impact information?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'hit several farms' lacks specific scale/impact details to confirm alarmist framing."}

### Question Q3
**Q3: Moderate Verbs + Scale/Impact**
Does the author or a quoted source use a 'moderate verb' (e.g., 'swept across,' 'hard hit,' 'soared,' 'plummeted') AND is this verb explicitly paired with information detailing significant scale or impact (e.g., 'millions culled,' 'record losses,' 'overwhelming systems'), as detailed in the rules?

**🔍 Q3 Pattern Recognition Table (revised):**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Moderate Verb (past-tense)** **+ Scale** | "swept across + millions culled," "hard hit + record losses," "soared + overwhelming systems," "**were/was culled** + 3 million birds" | ✓ |
| **Moderate Verb (past-tense)** **+ Quantity** | "surged + 50 % increase," "plummeted + largest decline," "hit + thousands affected" | ✓ |
| **Moderate Verb (present/future/plan)** <br/>*(e.g. "**planning to cull**", "could hit")* | → **Neutral** (falls to Q8 capability or Q10 speculation, depending on context) |

**🔗 See also:** Q2 for high-potency verbs that are alarmist on their own; Q9 for economic reporting

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Alarmist. No → Proceed to Q4.

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**⏩ 60-Second Cue Cheat-Sheet:**
| If you see… | Frame | Quick test |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Moderate verbs** ("swept across", "hard hit", "soared", "plummeted") | Alarmist | **Only when** paired with scale/impact ("millions culled", "record losses") |
| **Moderate verbs extended** ("feared", "fearing" + toll) | Alarmist | Same scale rule as above |
| *(Plain factual verbs **killed / died / affected / reported / euthanized / depopulated** do **not** qualify.)* |

**Alarmist - Examples:**
* Author: "The region was severely hit by the virus, resulting in record losses." (Alarmist → Author's use of "severely hit" and "record losses" to describe large-scale harm, assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* Author: 'From Wyoming to Maine, the highly contagious bird flu swept across farms and backyard flocks, prompting millions of chickens and turkeys to be culled.' (Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: "The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%." (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).
* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: "Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds." (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').

**Key Principle:** "swept across," "hard hit," "soared," "plummeted" can be potent verbs on their own (see Q2) if used dramatically. This rule specifically addresses their use when their alarmist nature is confirmed by accompanying details of scale/impact.

**Boundary Requirements (clarified):**
1. Verb **must appear in the approved list / regex**.  
2. Must denote realised impact (not a plan or hypothetical).  
3. Plain outcome verbs (*killed, died, affected, reported*) are excluded—Neutral unless other cues fire.

**Examples of Scale/Impact Indicators:**
- Numerical quantities: "millions," "thousands," "50%," "record numbers"
- Comparative terms: "largest," "highest," "most severe," "unprecedented"
- Impact descriptors: "overwhelming," "devastating losses," "widespread damage"

> **New aspect guard.** The moderate-verb must denote **realised impact** – NOT merely an intention or hypothetical.  

**Regex Pattern (tightened – comment shows exclusion):**
```regex
\b(hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|
     # ONLY active, realised culling counts
     (?:were|was)\s+culled|hitting)\b
(?=[^.]{0,40}\b(?:\d|million|millions|thousand|thousands|record|largest|unprecedented|severe|significant|overwhelming|devastating|disaster|disasters|emergency|emergencies)\b)
```
# Passive/future forms ("to be culled", "had to be culled", "planning to cull")
# fall through to Q8 (capability) or Q10 (speculative relief).

**Clarification (v 2.16.2)** — Containment actions  
"Birds were *euthanized/depopulated* to prevent spread" is **Neutral** unless paired with an explicit large-scale impact (e.g., "euthanized ***millions*** of birds across 10 states").

If the parser lemmatises verbs, **keep only the past-tense form** `culled`; exclude the lemma "cull" and its gerund unless explicitly preceded by a past-tense auxiliary ("were/was culling") that confirms an event already occurred.

✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**
1. If you answered **"yes"**, STOP processing lower hops.
2. Quote decisive cue(s) in the *rationale*.
3. No Alarmist on neutrally stated **bad** facts.
4. No Reassuring on neutrally stated **good / low-risk** facts.
5. First "yes" only – no double hits / overrides.
6. Output must be pure JSON and **nothing else**.

🔧 **Implementation hint** – add a regression test where  
Input: "We are confident our systems are ready." → expect Q5 = yes, Reassuring.

*Re-read this list; fix any violation before sending.*
# 7. If you reach **Q12** and still cannot assign a frame with certainty,
#    return an **Unknown** label:
#        { "answer":"unknown",
#          "rationale":"Q12 reached with no decisive cues; frame unresolved" }
#    Down-stream evaluation will skip these rows.
