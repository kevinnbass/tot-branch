{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment Against Q1 of the 12-Step Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment: \"Egg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015.\"  My task is to determine if this segment meets the criteria for Q1 of the 12-step decision tree, which is essentially checking for an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nLet's dissect this. \"Egg prices soared\" â€“ that's background; the price movement. It uses a vivid verb, which I need to be careful with given the context guard regarding vivid language. But even if I wanted to consider it, \"soared\" is a verb, not an intensifier or comparative.  Next, \"outbreak\" is a factual noun, not a risk-adjective. Then, \"ravaged the United States\" - while \"ravaged\" is a vivid verb describing the impact, it isn't relevant to Q1, because it's a verb not an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nMy focus is on spotting intensifiers or comparatives like \"very,\" \"more,\" or \"extremely\" directly modifying risk-adjectives such as \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" or \"severe.\"  I'm not seeing that pattern here. \"Soared\" is a vivid verb describing the price movement, and the verbs \"ravaged\" describes the impact. Neither pattern fits Q1.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is a clear \"no\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers or comparatives modify risk-adjectives in the segment.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment uses the high-potency verbs 'soared' (modifying prices, a direct impact noun) and 'ravaged' to describe the event and its impacts, framing the situation alarmingly.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Alarmist Framing Detected**\n\nOkay, so I'm analyzing this text segment: \"Egg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015.\" The task is to apply Q2 of the decision tree, which is all about spotting alarmist language. I need to scan for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative/negative noun combinations, and critical alert phrases.\n\nLooking at the text, I immediately zero in on a couple of possibilities: \"soared\" and \"ravaged.\"  \"Soared,\" especially when used in the context of prices, feels like it could be a trigger. The regex does indeed consider \"soared\" to be high-potency in this context since it's followed by \"Egg prices,\" which is definitely an impact noun. Bingo.\n\nThen there's \"ravaged.\" That's a powerhouse verb on its own. It's listed in the table of high-potency verbs.  The outbreak *ravaged* the United States?  Yup, that fits the bill.  Two hits!\n\nSince both \"soared\" and \"ravaged\" qualify as high-potency verbs under Q2, that's a clear \"yes\" answer to the question. Because Q2 yields a \"yes,\" I don't need to look any further down the decision tree. Q2 lands me at Precedence #2, which is VIVID-VERB -> Alarmist.\n\nTherefore, the frame here is Alarmist. I need to report a \"yes\" to Q2, citing \"soared\" and \"ravaged\" as the decisive cues."}
