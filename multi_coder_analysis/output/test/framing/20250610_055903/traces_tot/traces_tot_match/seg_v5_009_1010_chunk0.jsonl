{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'particularly' modifies the risk-adjective 'brutal'.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"The winter of 2020 was particularly brutal, causing a shortage in the domestic supply of poultry livestock.\" My task is to evaluate this against Q1 of the decision tree, which is essentially looking for intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nI immediately spot \"particularly brutal\".  \"Particularly\" is clearly an intensifier, and \"brutal\" fits the bill as a risk-adjective, based on my understanding of the relevant rules and regex.  This matches the \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj\" pattern perfectly. The decisive cue here is definitely \"particularly brutal\". Since this match fulfills Q1, the Precedence Ladder dictates that this points directly to the Alarmist frame."}
