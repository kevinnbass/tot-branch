{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmism**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to analyze this sentence: \"The virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\"  My task is to determine if it triggers the \"Alarmist\" frame.  I need to apply the first question (Q1) of the decision tree.\n\nQ1 asks if there's an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. Let's see...  Ah, here it is: \"so contagious.\"  \"So\" is clearly an intensifier, and \"contagious\" is definitely a risk-adjective.  It's on the approved list, and it fits the definition perfectly.  The intensifier \"so\" directly modifies \"contagious.\" This matches the pattern described in the \"Alarmist\" column of the table: \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj.\"  And, as the \"RULE 1 QUICK MEMORY HOOK\" reminds me, this is a key indicator of alarmist framing.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is \"yes.\" According to the established precedence, that means I stop right here. Since Q1 is a \"yes,\" the frame is automatically \"Alarmist.\" I don't need to consider any subsequent questions.  The decisive cue here is \"so contagious.\"\n\nI've also run through my self-audit checklist to confirm that I'm on track.  Everything checks out, so I'm ready to output the pure JSON."}
