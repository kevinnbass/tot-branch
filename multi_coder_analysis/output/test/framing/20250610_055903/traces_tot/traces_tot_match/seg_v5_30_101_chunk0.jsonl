{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Segment: \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess this segment, \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states,\" against Q1 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if it contains an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nRight off the bat, I recognize that \"Outbreaks\" is a negative fact, but it's not a risk-adjective in itself. The word \"detected\" is a verb, but it doesn't fit the profile of a vivid verb that's impactful, so Q2 isn't relevant here.  \"More than a dozen states\" clearly describes the scope or scale of the outbreak, but there's no moderate verb coupled with a scale indicator that would trigger Q3.\n\nNow, let's break down the segment piece by piece. There are no direct intensifiers like \"very,\" \"so,\" or \"extremely.\"  And, critically, there are no comparative adjectives modifying a risk-adjective. \"Deadlier,\" \"more dangerous,\" something like that just isn't present.\n\nI do see the word \"more\" in \"more than a dozen states,\" but this \"more\" is part of a quantifier, describing quantity or scale. It's not functioning as a comparative adjective modifying a risk-related term, like in \"more deadly\" or \"more severe\".\n\nTherefore, after a thorough review, I can definitively say that the segment doesn't contain the pattern we're looking for, the intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk adjective. My answer to Q1 is \"no.\" This is because the necessary linguistic structure is not present."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the neutral verb 'detected' and lacks high-potency verbs, metaphors, or other Q2 cues.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: Segment Evaluation**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment: \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\" My task is to evaluate it based on Q2 of that decision tree.  Essentially, am I seeing any of those high-impact cues – high-potency verbs, striking metaphors, those superlative-negative noun combinations, or the \"on high alert\" phrase?\n\nLet's break it down. \"Detected\" – it's a perfectly acceptable verb, but it's not exactly setting off any alarm bells.  It's factual, not dramatic. No metaphors popping out at me.  I'm not finding any superlative-negative pairings. \"More than a dozen states\" tells me about the *scale*, but it's presented in a straightforward way, like a report.  No \"on high alert\" either.\n\nBased on my analysis, Q2 is a \"no\".  The language here is neutral; it's presenting information rather than leaning on the kind of emotionally charged or impactful phrasing that would trigger a \"yes\" response in this decision tree."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'detected' is a plain factual verb, not one of the specified 'moderate verbs' required by Q3.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Evaluation - A Quick Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states,\" with Q3 in mind. My first instinct is to zero in on the verb, which is \"detected.\" Now, I need to check if this verb falls within the predefined list or regex that Q3 cares about, which is looking for more impactful verbs like \"hit,\" \"swept,\" or \"surged.\" A quick glance tells me \"detected\" isn't on that list. It's a plain factual verb, just stating an observation.\n\nThe next step is to assess for scale or impact. The phrase \"more than a dozen states\" clearly indicates a significant reach. However, according to the criteria for Q3, the scale or impact needs to be *paired* with a \"moderate verb\". It's like needing both ingredients for the recipe. So even though there's geographical scale, the \"detected\" verb alone doesn't satisfy Q3, following the \"60-Second Cue Cheat-Sheet\" for this decision tree. My conclusion is a firm \"no.\" The requirement for a moderate verb, coupled with a scale indication, isn't met here."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement of fact, not a question, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states,\" and I need to assess it against Question Q4. My expertise tells me Q4 is all about identifying loaded rhetorical questions that try to manufacture alarm or fear. It's looking for those cleverly disguised \"worry\" prompts.\n\nFirst, I dissect the text. It's a straightforward declarative sentence. No question mark, no implied inquiry. It's simply a factual statement, reporting the existence of outbreaks.\n\nThen, I review Q4. It highlights the manipulative nature of these loaded questions. It offers examples like \"Are we going to just stand by?\" or the more direct \"Should consumers worry...?\" These are designed to push a specific emotional response.\n\nNow, I put the two together. The text segment is just a statement of fact. There's no attempt to frame it as a question, let alone a loaded one. No fear-mongering, no implication of urgency. Therefore, applying the logic of Q4, there is no loaded rhetorical question here. The answer is clearly \"no.\"\n\nFollowing the rule, since the answer is \"no,\" I know I need to proceed to Q5 in the evaluation process. I'll need to format my output appropriately as a JSON object with the answer and a succinct explanation."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (outbreaks detected) but contains no explicit calming language or assurance of safety/control from the author or a source.", "thoughts": "**Q5 Evaluation: No Explicit Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I need to assess this text segment, \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states,\" specifically for explicit calming cues as per Q5. That means I'm looking for language that screams reassurance, that is, words that directly signal safety, control, or low risk. I'm focusing on those explicit signals.\n\nReading the segment, it's just a statement of fact: outbreaks have been detected. While \"outbreak\" itself carries negative connotations, the sentence is neutral. There's no attempt to mitigate that negativity with reassuring phrases. No \"Don't worry,\" no \"It's all handled,\" no \"It's not that bad.\" Nothing like the examples provided in the Q5 guidelines. It's just a report.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding of Q5, and my expert knowledge of how calming cues are typically phrased, my answer is a resounding \"no.\" This segment doesn't contain any explicit reassuring language. Time to move on to Q6."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment 'Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states' lacks both a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) and an explicit scale contrast ('out of X') required for this rule.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Reassurance through Minimiser and Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment: \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\" My task is to see if it fits the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern (Q6) for reassurance. Essentially, does it try to downplay the event by using a minimiser and a contrasting scale?\n\nFirst, I see the phrase \"more than a dozen states.\" It's definitely a *scale* – it's referring to a quantity of locations. However, to pass Q6, it needs to be contrasted with a *larger* scale. Like if it said \"outbreaks detected in more than a dozen states *out of 50*\" or \"*among thousands of counties*.\" Without that larger context, it's just a number.\n\nSecond, I need to look for a *minimiser*. Words like \"only\", \"just\", \"merely\", or \"a few\" – something that presents the quantity as small or insignificant. \"More than a dozen\" is *not* a minimiser. It's quantifying, but not in a way that minimizes. It doesn't frame it as something small in contrast to something larger.\n\nGiven that it's lacking *both* the crucial elements – a minimiser *and* a contrasting scale – I have to conclude that this segment *doesn't* employ the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern for reassurance. Therefore, the answer to Q6 is a clear \"no\"."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment 'Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states' does not contain a bare negation. It states a positive fact (outbreaks detected).", "thoughts": "**Assessing for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states,\" and I need to assess it against Q7, my bare negation detector. My understanding of Q7 is that it's looking for those subtle negations, the ones that *imply* something negative without explicitly saying so. I need to spot instances like \"not expected to be an issue,\" or phrases that essentially say \"nothing bad happened.\"\n\nFirst, I break down the phrase. \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\" It's a statement of fact, a positive observation. There's no \"not,\" no \"unlikely,\" no \"no\" in sight. It's a direct statement that outbreaks *were* detected.\n\nNow I run it against my mental checklist of bare negation indicators. Does it imply a negative outcome? Arguably, an outbreak detection isn't inherently a good thing, but the phrase doesn't *negate* anything. It's not saying \"it's not a problem\" or \"we haven't seen any issues.\" It's just stating a fact.\n\nSo, according to my training and experience, Q7 is looking for a specific type of negation, one that quietly downplays a potential negative. This phrase is simply not doing that. The answer is a clear \"no.\" It's not a bare negation.\n\nTherefore, my response will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment 'Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states' does not contain a bare negation. It is a positive statement of fact and does not contain any of the negation patterns (e.g., 'not expected,' 'unlikely,' 'no cases detected') that Q7 is designed to identify.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a current negative fact (outbreaks detected), not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of \"Outbreaks Have Been Detected...\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this segment, \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states,\" and I need to see if it triggers Question Q8. Q8 is looking for Capability/Preparedness statements without active reassurance. Let's break this down:\n\nFirst, I look at the sentence itself. It's just a simple factual statement, a straightforward observation of something that's already happening. Then, I take Q8's criteria. It's looking for something specific: descriptions of capability, preparedness, hopeful future possibilities, or implemented safeguards, *but without* any kind of reassurance that things are currently calm or safe.\n\nSo, I check: Does the segment show capabilities? Nope. Preparedness? No. Hopeful future possibilities? Definitely not. Implemented safeguards? Again, no. It's just a statement about the *current situation*, and that situation is outbreaks.\n\nTherefore, the segment doesn't meet any of Q8's criteria. There's no talk of capability, or preparedness or any of those things. It's simply a factual observation of a negative event. Following the instructions, since the answer is \"no,\" I'm finished with this question."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports on health outbreaks, not prices, economic data, or financial metrics as defined by Q9.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Segment Against Q9**\n\nAlright, I'm being asked to analyze the phrase \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states\" and determine if it fits the criteria outlined in Q9. My initial thought is to break down the elements.  We have \"outbreaks\" which is clearly a negative event, and then \"more than a dozen states,\" which is a numerical representation of the affected area. The verb is \"detected,\" and that's key.\n\nQ9 specifically asks if a segment primarily reports prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs, *without* using vivid verbs or risk adjectives.  I see \"more than a dozen states\" as a numerical metric. But the heart of this question is if \"detected\" fits the criteria of \"standard descriptive verbs\" *in this specific context*.\n\nI check all the criteria. The context is not economic. It uses factual language, avoiding vivid verbs or risk adjectives. The focus is the *finding* of outbreaks, then the count, not an economic metric. \"Detected\" seems appropriate when describing the discovery. The primary focus of the question seems to be around economic data. The examples, and the reference guide, are all about prices, rates, losses, profits, etc.  The provided regex focuses exclusively on economic terms and verbs like \"rose\", \"declined\", etc., which are common in that field.\n\nEven though it uses a numerical metric, this segment doesn't discuss economic metrics or data. Therefore, it doesn't fit the pattern of Q9. I need to base this decision on my rigorous review and evaluation. The examples highlight economic/financial data, and since Q9 is designed for reporting, I consider the language used.\n\nI have to carefully apply the rules I have. I recall the Bedrock Principle: present the facts. The Symmetry Rule: alarmist fires when the negative is amplified. In this case, the segment *states* a negative fact, but doesn't amplify it. It states factually. No specific framing is used.\n\nSince Q9 is focused on economic reporting, and this is about a public health issue, it *does not* meet the criteria for Q9. My answer to Q9 must be \"no.\" Then I will proceed accordingly."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a current situation ('Outbreaks have been detected') and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Q10 Evaluation: My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with analyzing this text segment (\"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states\") based on a decision tree, specifically question Q10. Q10 is looking for speculation about future relief or improvement *without* a calming cue. If I find that speculation, the frame is Neutral. If not, I move on.\n\nFirst, I need to see if this segment actually *does* speculate. Does it hint at future improvement? No. It simply states a fact about the current situation: multiple states have outbreaks. It's a statement of the present, not a prediction of the future.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q10 is \"no.\"  The instructions say that if I get a \"no,\" I should move on to the next question (Q11, though that wasn't provided). But the prompt only asks for Q10's answer.\n\nNow, I need to generate the JSON response. That means an `answer` key and a `rationale` key. I know the `answer` is \"no.\"\n\nFor the `rationale`, I need to explain *why* it's \"no.\"  I've got to articulate that this is a statement of the present, not a prediction of the future.  Let's keep the rationale concise, within the token limit. Let's see...\n\nI've got it. The rationale is: \"The segment describes a current situation ('Outbreaks have been detected') and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.\" This is succinct and covers the necessary details. I'm ready to provide the JSON output."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any direct quotations or attributed statements from a specific source.", "thoughts": "**Assessing the Presence of a Dominant Framed Quotation (Q11)**\n\nOkay, so I've got this segment: \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\" My task is to see if it fits the criteria for Q11, which looks for a dominant framed quotation. That means I'm searching for a direct quote or attributed statement, basically someone saying something in those states.\n\nHmm, taking a good look at it... there are no quotation marks here, no cited sources, nothing directly attributed to a specific person or organization. It's just a factual statement. So, the answer to Q11 is definitively *no*. I'll mark it as such and move on to the next question in the series. I'm assuming it's Q12, which I'll tackle next based on the instruction."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit framing cues (intensifiers, vivid verbs, explicit calming). 'Outbreaks' is a standard term, 'detected' is neutral, and 'in more than a dozen states' is factual reporting of scale. Fits Q12 Neutral definition.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment: Segment is Neutral**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the segment \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states\" and tasked with applying the Q12 rule.  Even though Q12 is the final \"default\" rule, I need to methodically check all the preceding rules first to ensure no higher-precedence Alarmist or Reassuring cues are present.  Let's walk through it.\n\nFirst, Q1:  No intensifiers combined with risk adjectives here.  Good.\n\nNext, Q2:  \"Detected\" is neutral, not a vivid verb. \"Outbreaks\" is a standard term, not vivid.  So, no.\n\nQ3 now.  \"Detected\" *is* a moderate verb, and \"more than a dozen states\" *is* a scale.  However, this combination doesn't automatically trigger Alarmist framing. I need to consider whether it's amplifying the impact in an alarming way. \"Detected in states\" is reporting the location or spread, but not necessarily amplifying the severity.  I recall the rule mentions vivid language *on background conditions* is ignored, but vivid language on the *threat's own realised impact* *does* trigger Alarmist. I'm going to re-read that context guard for my confidence. \"Detected in more than a dozen states\" reports the spread, but the verb \"detected\" isn't vivid. The scale is factual.  So, no to Q3.\n\nQ4 (explicit calming language):  Nope, no calming language.\n\nQ5 (bare negation/capability):  Not applicable.\n\nQ6 (default): Not applicable either since Q12 is the final one.\n\nSo, I'm at Q12.  This segment reports a factual situation: outbreaks are happening.  \"Outbreaks\" is a standard descriptive term for a negative event. \"Detected\" is neutral.  \"In more than a dozen states\" is a factual statement of scale.  No intensifiers, vivid verbs, calming language, or exaggerations are present.  Essentially, we have a negative fact presented factually.  This aligns with the Bedrock Principle and Symmetry Rule: a negative fact presented factually is Neutral.\n\nLet's double-check against the Q12 definition. Q12 asks if there are no explicit Alarmist *or* Reassuring cues, and if the presentation is purely factual.  I believe the answer is yes.  We have factual reporting of a negative event, but the language used is neutral.  This perfectly matches the \"Factual Reporting\" pattern within the Q12 table: (\"detected in 3 locations\" -> ✓ Neutral).\n\nIn short, there's no rhetoric present. Therefore, I conclude the segment is Neutral. The rationale is straightforward: no intensifiers, vivid verbs, or explicit calming language, and \"Outbreaks,\" \"detected,\" and \"in more than a dozen states\" are neutral and factual. There is no added rhetoric.  I'm confident in my assessment."}
