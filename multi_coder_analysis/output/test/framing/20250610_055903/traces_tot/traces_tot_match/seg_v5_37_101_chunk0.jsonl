{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking for a comparison but contains no intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Comparative Outbreak Question**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" and my task is to analyze it using this 12-step decision tree. The first question, Q1, is a good starting point. It's asking me to look for an intensifier or a comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-related adjective within the segment.\n\nI've carefully examined the phrase. I'm looking for those red flags: things like \"so,\" \"very,\" \"extremely\" amplifying a risk word, or comparative terms like \"more,\" \"less,\" \"deadlier,\" paired with words indicating danger or severity.  And, really, I'm not finding any.\n\nThe phrase is clearly asking for a comparison, but it's not employing those specific linguistic cues that Q1 is designed to spot. So, after a thorough review, the answer here is a definitive \"no\". This means I need to proceed to the next question in the decision tree."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and contains no high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment for Alarming Framing**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this text segment: \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" and asked to evaluate it based on Question 2 (Q2) of the decision tree. Q2 is designed to identify language that might be framing the situation as more alarming than it needs to be. It's looking for things like powerful verbs, potent metaphors, negative superlatives, or the specific phrase \"on high alert.\"\n\nLooking at the segment, it's a straightforward question about comparing outbreaks. There are no dramatic verbs like \"ravaged\" or \"devastated.\" No evocative metaphors like \"ticking time bomb\" or \"nightmare scenario\" appear.  I also don't see any superlative phrases paired with negative nouns, like \"worst crisis\" or \"most devastating.\"  And, crucially, there's no mention of \"on high alert\" or anything similar.\n\nTherefore, after thoroughly examining the text against the criteria of Q2, my conclusion is clear: the answer is \"no.\"  I'm ready to move on to the next question if needed, but the prompt only requested the Q2 evaluation. Here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \\\"on high alert\\\" to indicate alarmist framing.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and does not contain any moderate verbs paired with scale/impact information.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Alarmist Framing: Q3 Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text segment, \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" and I need to assess it against Q3 of the decision tree.  My understanding of Q3 is crucial here: it flags an Alarmist frame if we see \"moderate verbs\" paired with information about \"significant scale or impact.\" I need to see if this segment triggers that alarm.\n\nMy process will be methodical. First, I'll need to check for any verbs from the approved list - things like \"hit,\" \"swept,\" \"surged,\" etc. These verbs are key indicators of realized impact. Second, that verb MUST be paired with explicit information detailing the scale or impact. Things like \"millions,\" \"record losses,\" or \"overwhelming systems\" are what I'm looking for.\n\nNow, let's break down the segment.  The main verb is \"compare.\"  Hmm, not on the list.  This immediately raises a red flag. The segment is framed as a question about comparison, not a direct statement about impact.  I see no verbs indicating realized impact, and crucially, there's absolutely no mention of any specific scale or impact - no numbers, no quantifying terms.\n\nTherefore, since the segment lacks the necessary \"moderate verb\" and the crucial \"significant scale or impact\" information, the conditions for Q3 are definitively not met. The answer is a clear \"no.\"  I've thoroughly checked for both the verbs and the impact context, and neither is present. This segment doesn't trigger my Alarmist frame detector."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The question 'How do these outbreaks compare...' is a neutral, information-seeking question, not a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Rhetorical Weight of the Question**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with evaluating the phrase \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" against Q4, specifically to determine if it's a loaded rhetorical question designed to instill alarm. As an expert in \\[*Insert your field here, e.g., epidemiology, communication, critical analysis*], I can see this requires careful examination.\n\nFirst, I've isolated the segment. Now, I'm referencing Q4, which focuses on identifying questions that are intentionally framed to generate fear or a sense of urgency, separating those from neutral, information-gathering inquiries.\n\nUpon direct comparison, \"How do these outbreaks compare...\" presents a clear, factual question. It's seeking objective data and analysis: it's not prompting an emotional response. It isn't using loaded terminology that's typical of alarmist rhetoric, such as words or phrases that suggest crises or threats. I'm focusing on the nature of the information it seeks.\n\nTo reinforce this, I'm checking against the examples and rules within Q4. It's akin to asking about safety protocols or result availabilityâ€”genuinely neutral inquiries. Contrast that with loaded questions designed to provoke worry or concern.\n\nMy conclusion is clear: this question is not loaded. It's a straightforward request for comparative data, and therefore, the answer to Q4's question is \"no.\" My output will reflect this assessment."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking for a comparison and contains no explicit calming language or cues about current safety or control.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Reassuring Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a phrase, \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" and asked to evaluate it based on the criteria for \"Reassuring\" cues within the 12-step decision tree, specifically Q5. I need to determine if this phrase, as it stands, offers explicit communication of safety, control, or reduced risk.\n\nMy initial assessment is straightforward. This is a comparative question, a request for information. It's not a statement designed to calm or reassure. There's no language directly addressing safety, control, preparedness, or even subtly minimizing present risk. I see no \"We are safe,\" or \"You are in good hands\" type of message. It's purely seeking to contextualize current events against historical data.\n\nTherefore, applying my expertise in this decision-making framework, I must conclude that the answer to Q5 is a resounding \"no.\" The segment does not contain any explicit calming cues that would meet the criteria for being classified as reassuring. My rationale is the complete absence of any language that directly communicates or implies current safety, control, or significantly diminished present risk."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and contains no minimiser or scale contrast cues.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Reassurance Techniques**\n\nOkay, I'm at Q6 and need to determine if the text segment \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" uses the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" reassurance technique. I'm focusing on those specific elements: a minimiser (like \"only\" or \"few\") and an explicit or implied scale contrast (\"out of,\" \"among,\" etc.).\n\nScanning the text, it's immediately apparent there's no minimiser present.  Furthermore, I don't see any indication of a scale contrast either.  This is a straight-up comparative question. It's not trying to downplay the significance of the outbreaks by using those specific linguistic markers.  \n\nTherefore, Q6 is a definitive \"no.\"  I'll build the JSON response now and move on (even though the prompt only asks for Q6 - I'm ready for the next step!)."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and does not contain any statement of fact, let alone a bare negation.", "thoughts": "**Assessing for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" and need to assess it against Question 7, which flags \"bare negation.\" My understanding of bare negation is the direct denial of a risk or problem without any softening language. Let's break this down:\n\nFirst, I recognize this is a question, not a statement.  That immediately raises a flag. We're looking for a direct negation, like \"This outbreak *is not* a concern\" or \"We *don't* anticipate any issues.\"\n\nNow, comparing the phrase against the bare negation criteria, I can see that it doesn't contain any negation. There's no use of \"not,\" \"no,\" \"never,\" or any equivalent.  It's simply requesting a comparative analysis.  Therefore, and considering the phrasing of Q7, I'd say this certainly *does not* constitute a bare negation.\n\nI'll be sure to structure my response as a JSON object with `answer` and `rationale`."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking for a comparison, not a statement describing capabilities, preparedness, or future possibilities.", "thoughts": "**Q8 Evaluation: A Comparative Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the question, \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" and need to assess it against Q8. Q8, as I understand it, is looking for active reassurance in the form of capability or preparedness statements.  \n\nMy initial thought is, this is a comparative question. It's asking about the present outbreak in relation to past events. My expertise tells me that this doesn't, on the face of it, touch on the specifics Q8 is looking for.\n\nI'm checking if this segment describes capabilities, preparedness measures, or even hopeful statements about the future. Does it talk about officials acting, vaccines, plans, systems, protocols, safeguards, and so on? No. This query is purely about comparison.\n\nThe answer here is a clear \"no\" for Q8. It doesn't meet the criteria.  Now, on to Q9."}

My understanding is that Q9 is looking for segments that *explicitly* report prices, economic data, or numerical metrics, and does so using neutral language. We're looking for things like \"the price rose\" or \"unemployment declined by 2%.\" The focus is on objective reporting, devoid of any potentially inflammatory or suggestive framing.\n\nWhen I look at \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\", it's clear this isn't about reporting specific numbers or figures. It's a comparative question, seeking to establish a relative understanding of outbreaks.  It's about *comparing* the scale or nature of things, not about simply stating a raw metric like a price or percentage. This isn't reporting anything, it's a question.\n\nTherefore, this segment absolutely does *not* fit the profile of a Q9 segment. It doesn't report data in the required format. My assessment is definitely \"no\" for Q9."}

From my perspective, Q10 is pretty straightforward: it's looking for segments that are speculating about the future, specifically future *relief* or *improvement*, without any kind of calming signal about the present.\n\nNow, the phrase we're analyzing is a question: \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" Right away, I see this isn't about the future. It's explicitly asking for a comparison to *historical* data, which is firmly rooted in the past. It's seeking information about the current situation relative to what we've seen before. It's a purely factual question.\n\nIt's not making any predictions, hopeful or otherwise, about things getting better. There's no hint of \"things will ease up soon\" or anything like that.  It's simply asking for a side-by-side analysis. Therefore, it definitely *doesn't* meet the conditions of Q10. The answer here is a clear \"no.\""}

Q11, as I recall, is looking for a dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame, but *only* if that framing is explicitly stated by a directly quoted source.\n\nMy first thought is, is there a direct quote in this segment? Nope. It's a question posed by the author. That's a quick \"no\" right there.\n\nNext, I need to consider if there's any framing language, either Alarmist or Reassuring, attributed to a quoted source.  Again, no. There's no source, quoted or otherwise.\n\nTherefore, because there's no directly quoted source, Q11 doesn't even enter the picture.  The segment doesn't meet the criteria of the question.  The answer to Q11 is definitively \"no\".  I'll format my answer as required:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The text segment does not contain a directly quoted source, and therefore Q11 does not apply.\"\n}\n```"}

The task is to evaluate this \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" segment and determine the frame. I've worked my way through the decision tree, and now it's time for the final check. Did I miss anything alarmist or reassuring?\n\nLooking closely, the segment is a question, a straightforward request for a comparison.  \"Outbreaks\" itself is a neutral descriptive term, not inherently loaded. There are no intensifiers, no vivid language, no exaggeration of scale, and no attempts to soothe anxieties. It's a purely factual inquiry. This is not alarmist, or reassuring.\n\nTherefore, according to the final rule and the default, the answer to Q12 is a resounding yes, we default to the neutral framing here. The framing is neutral."}
