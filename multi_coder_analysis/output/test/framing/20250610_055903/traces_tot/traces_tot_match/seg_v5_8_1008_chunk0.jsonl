{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: A Clear \"No\"**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The user wants me to apply Q1, the first question in the 12-step decision tree, to this text. My understanding is that Q1 is all about spotting intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives.\n\nAnalyzing the segment, \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky,\" is straightforward. There's no hint of the pattern Q1 is looking for. No intensifiers like \"very\" or \"extremely,\" and no comparative adjectives like \"more severe\" or \"less dangerous.\"  The text is entirely neutral in its risk assessment.\n\nMy conclusion? The answer to Q1 is \"no.\"  The provided segment lacks the required pattern of an intensifier or comparative paired with a risk-adjective.\n\nI need to output this as a JSON object with the answer and a brief rationale, no more than 80 tokens. Let's get this done."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a lack of disclosure, but does not use any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases to frame the situation alarmingly.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment Against Claim Framing Question 2**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze the text, \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky,\" based on the second question in the 12-step decision tree for claim framing. My task is to determine if this segment employs any of the alarming language patterns defined in Q2.\n\nFirst, I need to look for those key indicators. I'm focusing on high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative noun combinations, and critical alert phrases. I have the specific list of verbs and phrases in mind: \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" \"skyrocketed,\" \"plummeted,\" and so on, along with phrases like \"ticking time-bomb\" and \"on high alert.\"\n\nNow, looking closely at the text, the verbs used are \"would not disclose.\" Definitely not on the list of high-potency verbs. There are no metaphors, superlative-negative combos, or critical alert phrases to be found either.\n\nThe segment is simply a statement of fact, a non-disclosure. There's no attempt to paint a dramatic or alarming picture of the situation. It's a straightforward report of information withheld.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q2 is unequivocally \"no.\" The text segment doesn't contain any of the linguistic cues Q2 is looking for. This means I'm moving on to the appropriate JSON response."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a moderate verb from the approved list paired with explicit scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for an Alarmist Frame**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text segment \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" and tasked with analyzing it through the lens of Q3 in this framing analysis decision tree. My expertise tells me Q3 specifically looks for \"Alarmist\" framing, indicated by \"moderate verbs\" paired with information about a \"significant scale or impact.\"\n\nI need to meticulously check this segment against the pre-defined criteria. First, I have to ensure the presence of a verb from my approved list or regex: `hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|culled(?!\\s+(?:flock|flocks|birds?|poultry))`. These verbs are crucial as they typically signal a strong and impactful action. Then, the verb needs to describe a realized impact, not just a potential one. Crucially, the segment must explicitly present this impactful verb with clear information on the scale or scope of the impact.\n\nLooking at the segment, I quickly see the verbs are \"would not disclose.\" Immediately, I know these verbs don't meet the primary requirement. They aren't in my list of significant verbs, and they're not actions conveying a realized impact. Furthermore, there's no accompanying information denoting scale or impact. The sentence simply states a lack of disclosure, not a significant action or consequence.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is a clear \"no.\" The segment doesn't meet the criteria for an \"Alarmist\" frame because it lacks a moderate verb from the approved list and is devoid of any information detailing significant scale or impact."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement, not a question, and therefore cannot be a loaded rhetorical question.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment in Relation to Q4**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" against Q4. Q4 is all about identifying loaded rhetorical questions that are designed to whip up alarm or a sense of urgency. I immediately see the key here: *questions*. The segment is a plain, factual statement. It's simply reporting something that happened (or didn't happen, more accurately).\n\nQ4 gives me examples of what *would* count as a loaded rhetorical question, things like, \"Are we just going to let this happen?\" These are designed to manipulate the reader's emotions. They're not just seeking information; they're trying to push a particular point of view.\n\nWhen I compare the segment to Q4's criteria, the match is nonexistent. It's not a question at all, let alone a loaded one. Therefore, the answer to Q4 is clearly \"no.\" The segment doesn't contain the rhetorical device in question.\n\nThe prompt states that if it's a \"no\" answer, I proceed to the next question, which I'll be prepared to do. The output will be a JSON object, of course, with \"no\" as the `answer` and a concise explanation of the analysis for the `rationale`."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text reports a lack of disclosure and contains no explicit calming language or cues about safety or control.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky,\" and I'm being asked to determine if it answers \"yes\" to Question Q5. That question, as I recall, is about whether there's an explicit calming cue for reassurance. I know the nuances of these decision trees well. I'm looking for language directly communicating current safety or minimizing present risk. Think phrases like, \"no cause for alarm,\" or \"public can rest easy.\"\n\nWhen I read the text, I see a simple statement about non-disclosure. It's informative, but it's *not* reassuring. There's nothing in there that tries to assuage any potential concerns. It's a straightforward report, not an effort to calm or control fear. It certainly doesn't fit any of the patterns I'd be looking for in terms of language.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q5 is definitely \"no.\" I'll need to reflect this in my JSON output, clearly stating \"no\" and briefly noting the absence of explicit calming language."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment 'Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky' contains no minimiser or scale contrast cues required for Q6.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Decision Tree Q6**\n\nOkay, I've been tasked with assessing this text segment against Q6 of our decision tree. The goal is to determine if it uses \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" for reassurance. I need to see if it includes a minimizer word, a contrasting scale, and if they work together to create a reassuring effect.\n\nLooking at the segment: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky,\" I can already see some obvious issues. The first thing I check for is a minimizer word – something like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely.\" Nope, not here. Then, I look for an explicit or clearly implied contrasting larger scale or context. Still nothing.\n\nSince neither of the required elements are present, it's pretty clear this doesn't create a reassuring effect using the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" approach. It just states a fact: Tyson Foods isn't disclosing flock size. There's no attempt to downplay or mitigate the significance of that non-disclosure.\n\nSo, according to Q6's criteria, my answer has to be a firm \"no.\" The segment completely lacks the necessary elements: a minimizer and a contrasting scale that work together to provide reassurance."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains a negation ('would not disclose') but it is not a 'bare negation' as defined by Q7, which relates to denying or downplaying risks, problems, evidence, or capabilities. This statement is about a company's action regarding information disclosure.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing \"Tyson Foods would not disclose...\" for Q7**\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate the phrase \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" in relation to Question Q7. Q7 is specifically looking for \"bare negation\" without a calming cue.\n\nFirst, I see the negation: \"would not disclose.\"  That's clear. Now, does this fit the Q7 definition of a bare negation? Q7 defines this as denying or downplaying a risk or problem. Examples include things like \"not expected to cause problems\" or \"tests were negative.\"\n\nMy immediate thought is, \"Would not disclose\" is a statement about *information*, specifically, the company's *decision* to withhold it.  It's not directly addressing a risk or problem.  The Q7 examples are about negating a negative event or condition directly. This is different.\n\nI look at those Q7 examples again: expectation negations, evidence negations, risk negations, capability negations. They are all about the *absence* or *unlikelihood* of something bad.  \"Would not disclose\" isn't about the absence of a problem; it's about the absence of *information*.\n\nTherefore, I have to conclude that while there is a negation present, it's not a \"bare negation\" according to the Q7 definition. The phrase isn't denying or downplaying a risk or problem; it's simply stating that information is being withheld.\n\nSo, the answer for Q7 is \"no.\"  I'll move on to the next question, but that's beyond the scope of this particular task."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a lack of disclosure, not capabilities, preparedness, safeguards, or future possibilities.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" and tasked with determining its relevance to question Q8 of the decision tree. Q8 essentially asks if the segment describes capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards *without* explicitly linking them to current calm, safety, or minimized risk.\n\nMy expert assessment tells me this is a simple information disclosure issue. I immediately see that the text doesn't touch on any of the Q8 characteristics. It doesn't describe capabilities, preparedness, potential future positive actions, safeguards, or hopeful future possibilities. Instead, it's a direct statement of information *withholding*.\n\nThe key here is that Q8 specifically looks for those elements *unlinked* to present calm. This segment is simply about a lack of information, and therefore doesn't fit the pattern. After carefully analyzing it, reviewing the Q8 criteria, I can confirm that the answer is definitively \"no.\" The rationale concisely summarizes my analysis: \"The segment describes a lack of disclosure, not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.\" That should fit the token limit, and the user-specified structure."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a lack of disclosure about a metric, not the metric itself using standard economic reporting language.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Tyson Foods Segment Against Q9**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to assess that little snippet about Tyson Foods and their Kentucky flock against Q9. My initial thought is that it's tricky, but ultimately, the answer is a clear \"no.\"\n\nQ9 is all about spotting segments *primarily* focused on reporting numerical metrics – things like prices, economic data – using straightforward, neutral language. Think standard descriptive verbs and maybe some neutral adverbs, nothing flashy or inflammatory.\n\nNow, the segment does touch on a numerical metric: the size of the flock. But crucially, it doesn't *report* the flock size. Instead, it reports that Tyson Foods *would not disclose* it.  The focus isn't on the metric itself but on the lack of information.\n\nThe verb \"would not disclose\" is a perfectly ordinary, even passive, verb. It's not one of those vivid economic verbs we look for as flags. It also doesn't feature any of the risk adjectives or explicit framing that Q9 is designed to filter out.\n\nSo, while the segment *mentions* a metric, the core of the reporting is about the non-disclosure. That's not the same as *primarily* reporting the metric, as Q9 requires. Q9 is interested in how metrics *are* reported, not in situations where they *aren't*."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a fact about non-disclosure and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Speculative Future Relief**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" and asked to assess it against question Q10 of this decision tree. Q10 is looking for speculation about future relief or improvement without a calming cue. My initial read-through immediately tells me this is going to be a straightforward one.\n\nI need to look for any language hinting at future easing or betterment. I'm parsing this sentence closely. It's a simple, factual statement about a *past* action – or rather, a *non*-action. Tyson Foods *didn't* disclose something.  There's no forward-looking language, no hopeful predictions, no suggestion of things getting better or pressure being relieved. Nothing to suggest a future *potential*.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding of the parameters of \"speculation\" and \"future relief,\" my answer to Q10 is a resounding \"no.\"  The segment is purely descriptive and historical.  It doesn't meet the criteria for speculation about the future.\n\nThe JSON response for Q10 will reflect this:  `{\"answer\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"The segment describes a past non-disclosure and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.\"}`  And then, I'll move on to Q11 when I'm prompted. But for now, I'm done with Q10."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports an action by Tyson Foods but does not contain a direct quote or attributed statement with explicit framing language.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this segment: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\" My task is to see if it triggers Q11 of my decision tree, specifically looking for a dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame provided by a direct quote.\n\nFirst, I scanned the text for direct quotations, any words in quotation marks. Nothing there.  Then, I looked for attributed statements – statements clearly linked to a source.  \"Tyson Foods would not disclose...\" – there's my attribution. But, this is *reporting* what Tyson Foods *did*, not quoting a statement that they made.\n\nNow, I have to judge if this attributed statement provides a clear framing.  \"Would not disclose...\" doesn't, in and of itself, *frame* the situation as alarming or reassuring. It's a neutral report of a lack of information. It's not like they said something alarming like \"We're terrified!\" or something reassuring like \"There's absolutely nothing to worry about.\"  It's just a simple statement of fact.\n\nSo, Q11 is a clear \"no.\" No direct quote, no attributed statement with a dominant frame.  Now, on to Q12, whenever I get there!"}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit framing cues; segment reports a factual lack of disclosure neutrally.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Framing Cues in Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I've been asked to analyze this text segment: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\" using the 12-step decision tree. I'm at Q12, the final check. I need to ensure there aren't any remaining Alarmist or Reassuring cues before I declare it Neutral.\n\nLet's quickly run through the earlier questions. Q1 through Q4 are clear \"no's\".  There are no intensifiers paired with risk adjectives, no vivid verbs depicting impact, no moderate verbs amplifying scale, and no explicit calming language.\n\nThen, Q5 – and this is key –  we have a bare negation: \"would not disclose.\" The rule book says that defaults to Neutral. So, right off the bat, I know this is likely heading that way.\n\nNo loaded metaphors, exaggerated scales, or explicit rhetorical framing are present (Q6-Q8).  It's just a straight statement of fact: Tyson Foods didn't share information.\n\nLooking at author or source language (Q9-Q11), nothing jumps out as fear-mongering or overly reassuring.\n\nTherefore, because the negation lands on Q5 and the remaining questions are all \"no's,\" and because Q12 checks for final remaining framing cues, I'm confident in classifying this as **Neutral**. It is a simple, factual statement about a lack of information disclosure with no explicit Alarmist or Reassuring language."}
