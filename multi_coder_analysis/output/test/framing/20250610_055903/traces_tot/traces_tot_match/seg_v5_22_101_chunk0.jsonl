{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment asks about paying 'more' for products, which is a comparative related to cost, not a comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Segment \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this segment, \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\", and I need to run it through the first question of the decision tree. Q1 is all about spotting intensifying or comparative language that modifies a risk adjective – things like \"so dangerous\" or \"deadlier\". I know this stuff.\n\nLooking at the segment, I see \"more\". That's a comparative, but the question is, what is it modifying?  It's \"pay *more*\".  The \"more\" is modifying the *cost* of the product, not some inherent risk associated with it. \"More\" modifies \"pay\", not a risk adjective like \"deadly\" or \"dangerous\".  The phrase isn't saying something *is* more risky, it's asking if I'll *pay* a higher price.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is a clear \"no\".  The segment doesn't contain the specific pattern we're looking for.  It's a straightforward cost query.  Moving on."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a simple question and contains no high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Poultry Question**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to evaluate the phrase \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" against the second question of this decision tree.  My expertise immediately recognizes what needs to be checked: do we have any alarming framing techniques present? High-potency verbs, metaphors that amplify fear, a superlative paired with a negative noun, or anything that sounds the alarm bells in the user's mind.\n\nLooking at it closely, \"Can I expect to pay more...\" is a straightforward question. There are no fancy words or emotional manipulation here. \"More\" is relative, and there's no inherent negativity attached to the idea of paying more, just an expectation to be informed, so in itself it is not alarming to the user.\n\nTherefore, Q2's answer is a clear \"no.\" Now, on to the next step, I need to figure out what the *next* Q (Q3) in the decision tree is based on this response."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and does not contain any moderate verbs paired with scale/impact information.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Poultry Price Inquiry**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this statement: \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" and need to see if it fits within the parameters of Question 3 on the decision tree.  My expertise immediately tells me that Q3 is all about identifying 'moderate verbs' specifically linked to substantial scale or impact.  I'm looking for verbs like \"hit,\" \"surged,\" or \"plunged,\" along with clear indicators of significant change.\n\nWhen I analyze the segment, \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\", I see that it's a simple question. It's not using any of the verbs Q3 is looking for, and there's no descriptive language that suggests a huge price hike or market upheaval. There's nothing in there about massive supply shortages or widespread consumer panic. So, by my professional assessment, it doesn't align with what Q3 is looking for.  Therefore, my response has to be \"no,\" this doesn't meet the criteria."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The question 'Can I expect to pay more...' is a neutral, information-seeking question about potential price changes, not a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm or instill fear.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Poultry Pricing Question**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants me to assess \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" against Q4, the filter for alarmist, loaded questions. My initial impression is that this is a straightforward question, but let's be thorough.\n\nFirst, the segment *is* a question, that's clear. Now, is it rhetorical? Potentially, but it seems to be aiming for a direct answer regarding future pricing. Is it \"loaded\"? That's the crux of it. Asking about paying *more* is inherently undesirable, but the question itself doesn't scream panic. It doesn't use the typical \"crisis\" or \"disaster\" language. It's simply asking about a potential economic shift.\n\nI need to compare this to Q4's criteria. Loaded questions, according to Q4, are designed to induce fear, create a sense of urgency, or imply a threat. They're distinguishable from neutral questions seeking information. \"Can I expect to pay more...?\" doesn't seem to fit the alarmist pattern, like \"Should we be worried about...?\" or \"Are we facing a crisis...?\" It's more akin to \"Will prices increase?\" - a purely factual inquiry.\n\nLooking at the Q4 table, the patterns for \"Loaded Questions (Worry/Fear)\" are clearly defined: they're about worry, systems collapsing, and safety concerns. This question doesn't align with that. The neutral information-seeking questions, such as \"What are the safety protocols?\" feel much more appropriate.\n\nAnd the examples in Q4 solidify this. Those examples are explicitly trying to evoke fear and urgency. The question in question doesn't contain that emotionally charged language. It's just a question about a price change. Based on the examples and the clear guidelines of Q4, I have to conclude that \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" isn't a loaded question. It's a neutral, information-seeking inquiry.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q4 is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question about potential price changes and contains no explicit calming language or assurance about safety or risk.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Calming Cues in the Text**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with assessing the provided text snippet, \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\", against the criteria outlined in Q5 of the decision tree. My expert intuition tells me to zero in on any explicit calming cues, reassuring language, or statements directly addressing safety, control, or minimized risk.\n\nSpecifically, I'm looking for language patterns or any overt attempt to alleviate concerns. After carefully reviewing the segment, it's clear that it's a straightforward question regarding potential price fluctuations in the poultry market. There's nothing in there about safety, current control, risk mitigation, or even implicitly reassuring the reader.\n\nThis is simply an economic question. It doesn't contain any of the calming or reassuring language that I'd expect to find if it were designed to directly address concerns about safety, security, or minimize existing risks. Therefore, based on my understanding of the decision tree's Q5 criteria, my conclusion is definitely \"no.\" The text doesn't meet the requirements for an explicit calming cue."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and contains no minimiser or scale contrast cue.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing a Segment for Reassurance Techniques**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" and need to evaluate it against my Q6 rubric. Q6 is all about identifying 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' combinations used for reassurance.\n\nFirst, I break down the segment. It's a question, which is straightforward.  Now, I have to determine if this question utilizes that specific persuasive technique.\n\nI'll start by checking for a 'minimiser' – words like 'only,' 'just,' 'merely,' 'a single,' or 'few.'  Scanning the question, I don't see any of those.  Nope, no minimisers here.\n\nNext, I look for a 'scale contrast.' That would be phrases like 'out of thousands,' or 'among millions,' something that puts a potential negative in perspective.  Again, the question lacks this sort of framing.\n\nSince neither element is present, the combination – the *specific* combination we're looking for with Q6 – is absent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is definitively \"no.\" This phrase doesn't fit the pattern. It's not using 'minimiser + scale contrast' for reassurance. Now, I just need to construct the JSON object with the \"no\" answer and a clear rationale explaining the lack of minimisers or scale contrasts. Piece of cake."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and does not contain a bare negation.", "thoughts": "**Assessing for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, I need to evaluate the phrase \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" against the 'bare negation' criteria (Q7). First, I recognize it as a question about a potential increase in cost, a negative outcome from a consumer standpoint. Q7 specifically looks for instances of explicit negation, phrases like \"not expected,\" \"no cases,\" or similar constructions that deny or rule out something. This question, while inquiring about a negative economic impact, doesn't contain any explicit negation. It doesn't deny anything; it simply poses a question about a future possibility. Therefore, according to Q7's parameters, this segment does *not* contain a bare negation, so the answer is \"no.\""}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question about potential future cost, not a statement about capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Question Q8**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" and I need to determine if it fits the criteria of Question Q8 in the decision tree. Q8 is looking for segments that describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, *without* explicitly linking them to current calm, safety, or risk minimization.\n\nLooking at the phrase, it's clear this is a question about a potential negative financial impact. It's asking about *future* pricing, specifically if I should anticipate an increase. It doesn't detail any proactive measures, potential abilities, or future-oriented optimism in a general sense. There's no discussion of preparedness or safeguards; it's a direct question about a possible price hike.\n\nTherefore, this segment absolutely *doesn't* align with what Q8 is looking for. It doesn't describe capabilities, preparedness, or hopeful possibilities. It's a question of a potential negative future consequence. The answer to Q8 is definitively \"no\".  My JSON output will reflect this \"no\" answer, along with the fact that the segment doesn't meet the Q8 criteria as it's a question about future financial impact, not about capabilities, preparedness, or hopeful possibilities. Now, I need to move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question about potential future prices, not a report of current or past prices or metrics using descriptive verbs.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Segment \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this segment, \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\", and I need to assess it against Q9 of the decision tree. Q9, as I understand it, is looking for segments that are *reporting* prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using pretty straightforward language – neutral verbs, no dramatic adjectives or framing.\n\nInitially, the mention of \"pay more\" does point towards price, which falls under economic data. However, the key here is *reporting*. This is a question, not a statement of fact. It's asking about a *potential future* increase in price, not reporting a known price change.\n\nCritically, the segment doesn't use any of those \"potent\" verbs or vivid language that Q9 is trying to exclude. There's no \"rose,\" \"plummeted,\" or anything like that. No adjectives describing the price change, either. It's a simple, straightforward question about the *possibility* of a price increase.\n\nGiven this, I have to conclude that this segment does *not* fit the criteria for Q9. It's not primarily reporting prices or metrics in the way Q9 is designed to identify. Therefore, my answer is \"no,\" and I need to move on to the next question in the tree (Q10)."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment asks about a potential future negative outcome (paying more), not about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q10**\n\nOkay, so I've been given a text segment: \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" and asked to evaluate it based on Question 10 of a decision tree.  My understanding is that Q10 is looking for segments that speculate about *potential relief or improvement* in the future, but without any explicit calming cues.\n\nLet's break this down.  The provided segment poses a question – \"Can I expect to pay more...\"  The crux of it is clearly about a *potential negative outcome* related to the future, specifically an increase in price.  It's not about anticipating *relief* or a *better* situation.  It's quite the opposite; it's considering a potential worsening of circumstances.  Since it doesn't fit the specified pattern for Q10, my conclusion is that the answer here would be \"no\". The segment doesn't speculate about relief or improvement, but rather, about a potential negative change."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a directly quoted source.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Directly Quoted Frames (Q11)**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've got this text segment: \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" My task is to figure out if it contains a directly quoted source that *clearly* pushes an Alarmist or Reassuring frame, according to the Q11 rules. I'm an expert in analyzing this type of information, so I need to be precise.\n\nFirst, I need to check for a direct quote. It's pretty straightforward here. Looking at the segment, I see it's a question. It's the author's own words. There's no indication of someone else being quoted, no quotation marks or anything to signal a direct source.\n\nTherefore, since there's no quote present, the answer to Q11 is \"no.\"  The rules dictate that if there's no quote (or a neutral/balanced/absent quote or an authorial frame is dominant) you move on to Q12, but my instructions only require me to respond to Q11. My final answer will be structured as a JSON object with my answer and a justification."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment is a neutral question about a potential future event, lacking any explicit alarmist or reassuring language or framing cues.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Provided Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the final check, Q12, the \"default-to-neutral\" step. The text is \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" I need to give this a final once-over to see if anything slipped through the previous eleven questions.\n\nEssentially, I'm looking for any last-minute Alarmist or Reassuring framing that might not have been caught yet. The segment is a simple question about a potential future event: a price increase. It's a query, not a statement.\n\nI've already run it through the previous checks. There are no:\n\n*   Intensifiers plus risk adjectives\n*   Vivid verbs depicting impact\n*   Moderate verbs and scales/metrics\n*   Explicit calming language\n*   Bare negations or capability statements\n*   Any other specific framing covered in those initial steps.\n\nThe segment is just a simple question. It doesn't use emotionally charged language or rhetorical devices to amplify or minimize the potential outcome. It's a straightforward, neutral query.\n\nConsidering the Q12 rules, it’s a factual question and doesn't lean toward either Alarmist or Reassuring framing. There's no loaded language, no emotional tone. So, based on my understanding of this decision tree, this defaults to Neutral. It's a factual query, plain and simple.\n\nThe answer here is \"yes\" – there are no remaining explicit framing cues to change it from neutral. The presentation is purely factual.\n\n**Rationale:** The text is a neutral question about a potential future event, without any explicit alarmist or reassuring language or framing. Therefore, it is categorized as **Neutral** per the 12-step decision tree."}
