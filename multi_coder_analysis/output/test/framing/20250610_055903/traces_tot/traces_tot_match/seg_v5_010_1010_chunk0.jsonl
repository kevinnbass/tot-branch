{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'particularly' modifies the risk-adjective 'brutal'.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. The user wants me to apply Q1 of the decision tree to the given text. My focus is on identifying an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. I've got the necessary lists of risk-adjectives and intensifiers/comparatives at hand.\n\nLooking at the provided text: \"The winter of 2020 was particularly brutal, causing a shortage in the domestic supply of poultry livestock...\" I immediately spot the phrase \"particularly brutal.\" \"Particularly\" is clearly an intensifier, and \"brutal\" is on the list of risk-adjectives. Bingo! This matches the required pattern: (intensifier/comparative) + (risk-adjective).\n\nThe rule states that if this pattern is found, the answer to Q1 is \"yes,\" and the frame is \"Alarmist.\"  The key piece of evidence here is the phrase \"particularly brutal.\" That's the decisive cue.\n\nSo, my final answer is \"yes.\" and I'm ready to output this in pure JSON, per the user's instructions."}
