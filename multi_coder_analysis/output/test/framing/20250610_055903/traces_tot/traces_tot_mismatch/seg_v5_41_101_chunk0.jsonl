{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The comparative 'more' modifies 'geographic spread,' which is not a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Intensifiers and Comparative Adjectives**\n\nOkay, I've been given this text segment: \"I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\" and asked to apply the first question of the decision tree. This initial question focuses on identifying intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly preceding a risk adjective.\n\nLet's dissect this. The core question is whether we have a construction like 'very dangerous' or 'more severe'. Scanning the text, I see \"more geographic spread.\" \"More\" is a comparative adjective, clearly. But \"geographic spread,\" while describing the extent of the phenomenon, isn't a *risk* adjective in the sense we're looking for – something that directly describes severity or danger, like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" or \"catastrophic.\" It's describing the scope, not the inherent risk.\n\nSince the pattern of a comparative or intensifier directly modifying a risk adjective isn't present, the answer to Q1 is \"no.\" This means I need to move on to Q2 of the decision tree, but I don't need to evaluate that question just yet."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the neutral verb 'seeing' and the comparative phrase 'more geographic spread', which are not high-potency verbs, metaphors, or other Q2 cues.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to analyze this segment against the Q2 criteria, specifically looking for those red flags – high-potency verbs, impactful metaphors, superlative/negative noun combos, or the \"on high alert\" phrase that's designed to trigger alarm.\n\nLet's break it down: \"I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015.\" Right away, I'm checking for those key elements. I see \"seeing\" as the primary verb. That's a descriptive, neutral verb, not one of the high-potency ones on my list like \"ravaged\" or \"devastated.\" No red flags there.\n\nThe phrase \"more geographic spread\" does indicate a negative trend – increased expansion is generally bad news in these contexts. However, the *presentation* is factual. It's a comparison to a previous event, framed in a straightforward, comparative way. The Bedrock Principle and Symmetry Rule tell us that neutral framing of negative facts results in a neutral classification. Q2 demands more than just a negative fact; it demands *amplification* or *vivid framing*.\n\nI'm double-checking against the specific Q2 pattern list: no high-potency verbs, no superlative + negative nouns, no \"on high alert\" phrase, and no potent metaphors. The phrase \"more geographic spread\" itself is a measure of scale, but it's not being paired with the kind of language that Q2 is looking for.\n\nI've reviewed the table of examples and the specific criteria. The segment is stating a factual observation about an increase in spread, using comparatively neutral language. It doesn't meet any of the defined alarmist framing cues in Q2. Therefore, the answer is \"no,\" and I should proceed to Q3. The rationale is the verb 'seeing' is not high-potency and the phrase \"more geographic spread\" is a factual description, not framed with vivid language or a potent metaphor."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'seeing' is not on the list of moderate verbs for Q3, although scale ('more geographic spread') is mentioned.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text: \"I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\" My task is to assess it against question Q3 of the decision tree. Q3 wants me to look for \"moderate verbs\" paired with information that conveys \"significant scale or impact.\"\n\nFirst, I need to isolate the relevant part.  I've identified that the core of the statement I need to evaluate is \"seeing more geographic spread.\"  The verb is clearly \"seeing\".\n\nNext, I have to check if \"seeing\" falls into the category of \"moderate verbs\" as defined by the regex.  That is `\\b(hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|culled(?!\\s+(?:flock|flocks|birds?|poultry)))\\b`. I'm an expert in this, and I can see instantly that \"seeing\" isn't on that list.\n\nHowever, I do need to confirm if there is information that conveys a 'significant scale or impact'.  Looking closely at the phrase, \"more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015\" clearly indicates a comparison involving impact. The 'more' and the comparison to an earlier period provide a clear description of the impact.\n\nThe rule, as I understand it, demands *both* a moderate verb *and* scale/impact. Since \"seeing\" doesn't meet the criteria of a moderate verb, Q3's condition is not satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q3 must be \"no\". And that's all I need to focus on, even though I now know I would proceed to Q4."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains a declarative statement, not a question. It does not include any loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and need to determine if it aligns with Q4 of the decision tree, specifically looking for loaded rhetorical questions that are designed to instill alarm. My initial assessment is straightforward: the segment in question is a direct quote from Dr. Andrew Bowman.  I immediately focus on the *content* of his statement: \"I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015.\"\n\nMy expert eye immediately spots that this is a declarative statement. It's a factual observation, a comparison of current geographic spread to a past timeframe. It's simply stating a trend. It's not phrased as a question in any way. There are no question marks, no suggestive phrasing, nothing that hints at a rhetorical device aimed at implying alarm or manipulating the reader's perception.  The sentiment is neutral, simply reporting a finding.\n\nBecause there is no question, regardless of its loaded-ness or lack thereof, my conclusion is clear: the answer to Q4 *must* be \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the segment contains a straightforward statement, not a question, let alone a loaded rhetorical one."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports an increase in geographic spread, which is not an explicit calming cue for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text for Question Q5**\n\nOkay, I'm analyzing this segment against Question Q5, focusing on explicit calming cues. The text reads: \"'I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman...\" My job is to see if this conveys reassurance about safety, control, or minimized risk.\n\nLooking closely, Dr. Bowman's statement highlights an *increase* in something – geographic spread. That's not a comforting detail. I'm looking for phrases like \"don't worry,\" \"risk is low,\" or assurances of control. The text doesn't contain any of those explicit calming cues. So, based on this, my answer to Q5 is \"no.\" There are no reassuring elements here."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) combined with a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'among millions') to downplay the event.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with evaluating this segment against Q6, which focuses on identifying the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern – a specific form of language used for reassurance. First, I need to break down the text: \"I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman...\"\n\nNow, let's go through the checklist. Does this contain a minimiser? I'm looking for words like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" or similar terms that downplay something. No, I don't see any minimisers here. Next, I check for a scale contrast. This would involve phrases that establish a large context or scale, like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions,\" often used to frame something as insignificant. Again, nothing like that is present in the text.\n\nSince neither the minimiser nor the scale contrast elements are present, the segment clearly doesn't exhibit the pattern we're looking for. Consequently, my answer to Q6 is a definitive \"no.\" I'll need to formulate a clear rationale explaining the absence of the key components of the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern. Finally, I'll package this into the required JSON format."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states 'seeing more geographic spread', which is not a bare negation of risk or problem.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Against Q7: Identifying Bare Negations**\n\nOkay, so the task at hand is to assess this text snippet against Question 7 of our decision tree. Specifically, the question is whether the segment includes a \"bare negation\" *without* an accompanying calming cue. I need to dissect the text, looking for specific negation patterns, the usual suspects, and then confirm if there's no explicit attempt to calm any related concerns.\n\nThe segment provided is: \"I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\" My initial impression is that this is a comparison of past and present conditions, more descriptive than negatory.\n\nI'm checking for my \"bare negation\" checklist: Expectation negations, evidence negations, risk negations, and capability negations. Things like \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no evidence,\" etc. But in this segment, I don't see any of those markers. The statement \"seeing more geographic spread\" is, in fact, an observation – a direct statement about increased geographic reach, not a denial or minimization of spread. It's a statement comparing a past scenario and a current scenario; it does not deny or downplay anything.\n\nTherefore, because this segment doesn't exhibit any of the identified 'bare negation' patterns, my conclusion is that the answer to Q7 is \"no\". This absence of a bare negation means that, as per the established process, I'll proceed to the next step, Q8, in my analysis. The rationale, of course, is that the text doesn't contain any negation within the defined parameters."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes geographic spread, not capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of the Text Segment for Q8**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this. The task is to evaluate a segment (\"I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread...\") against question Q8 in this decision tree. Q8 is looking for content that describes capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, *without* explicitly linking them to a state of calm or safety.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the segment is actually saying. It's a statement about increased geographic spread. Based on the context (a veterinary medicine professor), it's likely about the spread of a disease. It compares the current situation to a previous period (2014-2015).\n\nNow, the core of Q8. Does this segment fit the criteria?  Does it describe capabilities? No. Preparedness? No. Hopeful possibilities? No. Implemented safeguards? Definitely not. The segment simply states a current observation.\n\nSince the segment *doesn't* describe any of those things, it can't possibly meet the *without* condition. The very premise is false.  I'm looking for a \"yes\" answer based on a description of capabilities or preparedness *not* being framed reassuringly. But there's *nothing* in the segment that's even *about* capabilities or preparedness. The segment is a simple observation about the current situation: increased spread.\n\nQ8 is designed to catch statements that might be trying to reassure us by focusing on what's being done, but subtly. Since this segment doesn't discuss any actions or plans, it doesn't fit the pattern Q8 is looking for. It's not about what's being done or will be done; it's just a statement of a negative fact.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to Q8 is unequivocally \"no.\" The segment doesn't describe the items Q8 is looking for (capabilities, etc.). That's the key.\n\nMy rationale will be straightforward: The segment does not describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful future possibilities, or implemented safeguards."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports geographic spread, which is not prices, economic data, or related numerical metrics as defined by Q9's scope and examples.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine,\" and I need to evaluate it against Q9. Q9 is all about factual reporting of prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics using standard verbs. My immediate thought is, \"This is not about money.\"\n\nThe segment mentions \"more geographic spread,\" which *is* a metric, a comparative one at that.  It's \"seeing more geographic spread.\" \"Seeing\" is a standard verb.  However, and this is key, the entire Q9 context, the examples, and the underlying *definition*, is about *economic* metrics, prices, costs, rates, revenue, etc. The language in Q9 and the examples given are *exclusively* about economic considerations. The regex even focuses on economic language. So, while \"geographic spread\" is a metric, it's not the *type* of metric Q9 is concerned with.  The context of a veterinary professor and discussions of geographic spread (likely of a disease) further reinforces that this is not about economic data. It's about a physical phenomenon, not the financial implications.\n\nThe Bedrock Principle guides us: ground your analysis solely in the provided text and rules. The rule's emphasis is economic. This isn't that. I've got to follow the rules, right? The focus in Q9 is so tightly tied to financial reporting, and the examples are all economic.  I'm looking at it and thinking: This isn't about prices. This isn't about economic data. It's about geography and comparison over time, but not *economics*.\n\nSo, while the segment *is* reporting a numerical metric (\"more geographic spread\") using a standard verb (\"seeing\"), it doesn't fall under the *economic/price* focus of Q9.\n\nI must say \"no.\" It does *not* fit Q9. The rule's core is economic and the language in the prompt isn't economic. Therefore, I need to proceed to the next question.\n\nThe prompt did mention Q10 but I don't have it. If prompted I'd look at other potential rules given the language \"certainly\" and a metric. It's likely Q3 will be relevant as this may be considered alarmist because of the implication of spread and \"seeing more geographic spread\" could imply a problem increasing in scope. However, my immediate concern is responding to Q9 correctly and nothing in the prompt says to apply any rules beyond Q9."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a current observation ('seeing more geographic spread') and compares it to a past event, rather than speculating about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q10**\n\nOkay, I'm being asked to analyze this segment, specifically against Question Q10 of this decision tree. Q10 is looking for speculation about *future* relief or improvement without a calming cue. Let's break it down: \"I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\"\n\nFirst, does this talk about future relief or improvement?  No. The statement's about the present situation: \"we're seeing more geographic spread.\" It's comparing the *current* observed situation to the past, 2014-2015. There's no prediction of the future here, no expectation of improvement. It's a statement of fact about the *current* scope compared to an earlier period.\n\nSecond, is there a calming cue? Nope. There's no attempt to downplay the situation or offer reassurance. The statement simply presents a factual comparison.\n\nSince there's no speculation about future relief or improvement, my answer to Q10 is \"no.\" This means I'd move to Q11 if I were continuing the analysis. However, my task is simply to answer Q10 based on the provided text. Based on my expertise, I'm confident my \"no\" is the correct answer. The segment reports a negative fact, but it does so factually, not speculatively."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The quote states a negative fact ('more geographic spread') but does not use explicit alarmist or reassuring language to frame it.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Quote for Q11**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this quote from Dr. Andrew Bowman about \"more geographic spread\" and I need to determine if it provides a *clear, dominant* Alarmist or Reassuring frame, according to Q11 of the decision tree. My initial impression is that it's a bit of a gray area, not a clear \"yes\" or \"no\" at first glance.\n\nThe core of the issue is whether \"more geographic spread\" is, on its own, framed explicitly as one thing or the other. We know that \"more geographic spread\" itself is *negative*—it's a wider distribution of something that could be potentially harmful. However, the *presence* of a negative fact is not, on its own, enough to trigger Q11.\n\nI'm checking the quote for the telltale framing words, the \"alarming,\" \"concerning,\" and \"catastrophic\" language that would clearly push it into the Alarmist bucket, or the \"reassuring,\" \"safe,\" and \"under control\" language that would mark it as Reassuring. I'm also keeping the Bedrock Principle and Symmetry Rule in mind: a negative fact stated *neutrally* is, well, neutral.\n\nAnd there's nothing in there. It's just a statement of observation, with the intensifier 'certainly' applied to *seeing* something, not the magnitude of the problem. While \"more geographic spread\" is concerning, it's not being explicitly *framed* as such. It's a factual statement, an observed trend. It's factual.\n\nSo, while the implications are negative, the quote doesn't explicitly frame the situation as alarming or reassuring in a way that aligns with the rules.  I'd have to say \"no\" to Q11. That means I move on to the next hop."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit alarmist or reassuring cues remain. The statement reports a factual comparison of geographic spread using neutral, descriptive language.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Framing in the Provided Segment**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process as I analyze this segment. I'm focusing on whether it's framed as Alarmist, Reassuring, or Neutral, using the 12-step decision tree.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I've properly navigated the Precedence Ladder (Q1-Q11), which leads me to this final stage, Q12. I'm looking for any remaining clear Alarmist or Reassuring cues, and if I don't find any, and the facts are presented factually, the frame defaults to Neutral.\n\nThe segment is: \"I think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\"\n\nI've already run through the earlier steps of the Precedence Ladder, and there are no immediate, high-priority alarmist cues. Now, let's go step-by-step:\n\n*   **Q1 (Intensifier + Risk-Adjective):**  \"Certainly\" is an intensifier, but \"more geographic spread\" doesn't fit as a risk-adjective. It's simply describing an increased scale, a comparison of the breadth of the phenomenon.\n*   **Q2 (Vivid-Verb):** No vivid verb is used to depict the impact of the threat. \"Seeing\" is neutral.\n*   **Q3 (Moderate-Verb + Scale/Metric):**  \"Seeing\" is not a moderate verb used to amplify the scale in an alarmist way. The metric \"more geographic spread\" is a neutral descriptor.\n*   **Q4 (Explicit Calming):** No calming language is present.\n*   **Q5 (Bare Negation/Capability):** No bare negation or capability statements.\n*   **Q6-Q11:** I didn't identify any other specific framing patterns in those steps.\n\nThe core of the segment reports a factual comparison: there's *more* geographic spread now than in the past. The speaker emphasizes this comparison with \"certainly,\" but it emphasizes the observation, not a catastrophic characterization of the spread itself. The comparison to 2014-2015 provides context but doesn't inherently frame the situation in an overly alarming way.\n\nQ12 specifies that if there are *no* explicit alarmist or reassuring cues, and the facts are presented neutrally, the frame is Neutral. Here, the phrase \"more geographic spread\" is a factual and comparative description of a negative trend. Although it is a negative thing, the language used to describe the trend is very objective and comparative, and not alarmist.\n\nBased on Q12:\n*   **Factual Reporting:** It's a factual report about the scale of the spread.\n*   **Neutral Metrics:** \"More geographic spread\" is a neutral metric comparing scale.\n*   **Descriptive Language:** The language is descriptive and comparative.\n*   **Neutral Presentation:** According to the \"Crucial Clarification\", if both the speaker's and source's presentation are neutral, the frame defaults to Neutral.\n\nTherefore, the segment meets the criteria for defaulting to Neutral.\n\nTo summarize, this aligns with the established rules:\n*   **Bedrock Principle:** We are evaluating the presentation, which is factual comparison.\n*   **Symmetry Rule:** The segment isn't alarmist because the negative fact (more spread) isn't amplified with strong intensifiers or emotional language *applied to its impact*. \"Certainly\" modifies \"seeing\", but doesn't make the spread itself sound catastrophic.\n*   **Precedence Ladder:** The earlier steps were passed.\n*   **Q12:** No remaining Alarmist or Reassuring cues. The presentation is primarily factual and descriptive.\n\nThe final conclusion is that the frame is Neutral. Q12 is a \"yes\"."}
