{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes scientists' actions due to 'lack of testing and limited genetic data', which is about lack of resources/data, not a bare negation about risk, cases, evidence, or capability.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_7_3540", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 241}
