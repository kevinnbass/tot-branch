# === GLOBAL BEDROCK PRINCIPLE (DO NOT DELETE) ===
# You are an expert claim-framing coder following a mandatory 12-step decision tree.
# Your analysis must be grounded *only* in the provided text and rules.
# You will be asked one question at a time.
#
# Bedrock Principle: CODE THE PRESENTATION, NOT THE FACTS.
# The frame is determined by explicit linguistic choices, not the objective severity of the facts.
# A severe fact presented factually is Neutral. A reassuring fact presented factually is Neutral.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  SYMMETRY RULE  (central, referenced not repeated)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------
#  Alarmist ≠ "any negative fact"; Reassuring ≠ "any positive fact".
#  • **Alarmist fires only when a negative / hazardous fact is explicitly
#    amplified** (intensifier, vivid verb, scale exaggeration, loaded metaphor).
#  • **Reassuring fires only when a positive / low-risk fact is explicitly
#    framed for calm or safety** ("public can rest easy", "risk is *very* low",
#    "fully under control", "only 1 out of 1 000 cases", etc.).
#  • Positive or low-risk facts stated neutrally → **Neutral**.
#  • Negative or high-risk facts stated neutrally → **Neutral**.

# === NEW CROSS‑HOP PRINCIPLE – SEMANTIC CONTEXT HANDLING ===
# Where a *quantifier / denominator* or *impact scale* lands in an
# **immediately adjacent clause or sentence** that is inseparable from
# the first (e.g. "Only three samples were irregular. Out of 5 000 that
# is a tiny share.") the model **may treat the pair as one rhetorical
# unit**.  Use this leeway **only when**  
# • the second clause is ≤ 20 characters away after the period/dash, **and**  
# • it unambiguously quantifies the *same* event.  
# Regex cannot reason over adjacency; the LLM must decide.

# === TECH_TERM_GUARD  (canonical, single source of truth) ===
# The biomedical collocations below are neutral taxonomic labels and
# NEVER count as intensifiers:  
#     "highly pathogenic (avian) influenza", "HPAI",
#     "highly pathogenic / virulent / contagious / transmissible"
# when occurring ≤ 3 tokens before a pathogen name.  A separate alarm
# cue must fire for Alarmist coding.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Context guard for vivid language
> A vivid verb/adjective that colours a **background condition**  
> (e.g. "amid **soaring** inflation", "during a **plunging** market")  
> is **ignored** for Alarmist coding.  
> Alarmist cues fire only when the vivid language depicts the threat's
> **own realised impact** (cases, deaths, prices, losses, shortages, etc.).

> **Context guard for psychological verbs**
> *Spark, stoke, reignite,* or *raise fears* describe a **public reaction**, not the realised impact of the threat itself.
> Treat them as **Neutral** unless the sentence either  
> (a) uses a vivid intensifier (*"mass panic"*, *"public alarm"*) **or**  
> (b) couples the verb with a concrete scale of realised harm  
> (e.g. "sparked panic **after** 5 million birds died").
> Plain "reigniting fears of another outbreak" is Neutral.

# ⇩ Precedence Ladder (authoritative; other hops now *reference* this ID)
# Precedence Ladder: If multiple cues appear, the highest-ranking rule (lowest Q number) determines the frame.
# 1. INTENSIFIER + RISK-ADJECTIVE -> Alarmist
# 2. VIVID-VERB -> Alarmist
# 3. MODERATE-VERB + SCALE/METRIC -> Alarmist
# 4. EXPLICIT CALMING -> Reassuring  
#    (Inside Q5 the row order Confidence > Preparedness > Low-Risk > Amplification)
#   • Direct food-safety assurances ("safe to eat/for consumption") belong here.
# 5. BARE NEGATION / CAPABILITY -> Neutral
# 6. DEFAULT -> Neutral
# If a segment simultaneously triggers an Alarmist cue **and** a Reassuring cue,
# the presentation is **mixed** → code **Neutral** (see Q12 default rule).
# **Technical‑term guard is absolute** – "highly pathogenic (avian) influenza"
# and similar taxonomy never functions as an intensifier, even inside quotes.

#  MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP DECISION PROCESS  (applies to every hop)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------
#  1. Start with Q1 and evaluate strictly against its rule text.
#  2. **If** your answer is **"yes"**:  
#       • Emit the frame dictated by the Precedence Ladder.  
#       • **Immediately STOP** evaluating lower-numbered hops.  
#       • Proceed to the self-audit checks below.  
#  3. Else → move to the next hop (Q {n + 1}) and repeat.
#
#  ✅ The 6-point self-audit checklist has been moved to a shared
#  **GLOBAL_FOOTER.txt** fragment that is appended *after* the
#  `YOUR JSON REPLY` stub inside every hop prompt so the model
#  reads it immediately before generating its answer.
