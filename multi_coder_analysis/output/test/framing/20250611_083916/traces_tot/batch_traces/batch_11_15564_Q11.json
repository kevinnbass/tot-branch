No (or quotes are Neutral/balanced/absent, or authorial frame is dominant) → Proceed to Q12.\n\n**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**\n\n**Guidance Note: Primacy of Framed Quotations (SUPERSEDES PREVIOUS QUOTE RULES)**\n**Technical-term override (v 2.17)**  \nBefore deciding that a quoted risk-adjective is Alarmist under Q11,  \n**skip** the cue if the adjective is immediately preceded (≤ 3 tokens) by the\nwhitelisted biomedical collocations:  \n*\"highly pathogenic\"*, *\"highly pathogenic avian\"*, *\"HPAI\"*.  \nRationale: Q1 technical-term guard has higher precedence and treats these\nas neutral taxonomy, not intensification.\n\n**Preparedness safety-link check (v 2.18)**  \nWhen a quote says *\"fully/well prepared (ready) to handle/deal with …\"* **but** lacks an explicit public/consumer safety link within 40 chars (e.g., \"so consumers are safe\"), treat it as **Neutral** rather than Reassuring.\n\nCore Principle: If a direct quotation (or a clearly attributed statement from a specific source) within the segment carries a distinct Alarmist or Reassuring frame, the segment's Dim1_Frame MUST reflect the frame of that quotation/attributed statement. This principle applies even if the author's narrative surrounding the quote is Neutral. The frame is determined by the language and tone used by the quoted source itself.\n\n**Key Scenarios:**\n* **Author's Neutrality:** When the author neutrally reports a framed quote, the quote's frame dictates the segment's frame.\n* **Author Reinforces Quote's Frame:** If the author's narrative also adopts or amplifies the same frame as the quote, this further strengthens the coding of the quote's frame.\n* **Author Challenges Quote's Frame (Advanced):** If the author explicitly challenges, refutes, or heavily recontextualizes the quote's frame using their own explicit framing language, the coder must determine the overall dominant frame of the segment. If the author merely presents a factual counterpoint after a framed quote, without adding their own framing to that counterpoint, the original quote's frame is more likely to prevail or be balanced to Neutral (see Mixed Messages). This scenario requires careful judgment of which frame is more salient. (For most cases, assume the author is not overtly challenging if they present the quote straightforwardly).\n\n**Multiple Framed Quotes & Mixed Messages within a Single Quote:**\n* If a segment contains multiple quotes with different frames, determine the dominant frame. If one quote is significantly more potent or central to the segment's point, its frame may prevail.\n\n**Handling Mixed Messages with Contrastive Conjunctions (e.g., 'but,' 'however'):**\nWhen a single quoted statement contains potentially mixed framing elements, particularly when linked by contrasting conjunctions (e.g., 'but,' 'however'):\n* **Evaluate Each Clause for Explicit Framing:** Independently assess the clause before the conjunction and the clause after the conjunction for the presence of explicit framing cues that meet the definitions for Alarmist or Reassuring in this codebook. This means applying the full Alarmist/Reassuring/Neutral definitions to each part of the source's statement.\n* **Framing Strength of the Concluding Clause:** For the clause after the conjunction to override or neutralize an explicitly framed initial clause, it MUST ITSELF contain clear and explicit framing language that meets the criteria for Reassuring or Alarmist. A neutrally worded factual statement, even if it factually counters or mitigates the initial clause, does not typically establish a new frame nor neutralize a potent initial frame on its own.\n\n**Resolution Scenarios:**\n* **Explicit Frame in Second Clause:** If the second clause contains explicit framing cues (Reassuring or Alarmist) that are at least as potent as, or more potent than, the first clause (per 'Principle of Cue Sufficiency'), it will generally determine or significantly influence the segment's frame.\n* **No Explicit Framing in Second Clause (Canonical Example):**\n  * Text: \"Meanwhile, Kirby Institute head of biosecurity Professor Raina MacIntyre described the bird flu news as 'concerning.' She [Professor Raina MacIntyre] said, however, that Avian flu viruses do not transmit easily in humans because they [Avian flu viruses] are adapted for birds.\"\n  * Correct Code: Neutral.\n  * Reasoning: \"The source provides an initial mild-to-moderate alarm cue ('concerning'). The subsequent clause, introduced by 'however,' states a fact ('do not transmit easily') that has reassuring implications but is itself presented by the source without any explicit reassuring language from the source (e.g., no 'thankfully,' 'which is excellent news,' 'so the public can rest easy,' 'this low transmissibility means the risk is negligible'). The neutrally-presented factual counter-statement balances the initial mild concern without the second part actively meeting the criteria for a Reassuring frame on its own. Thus, the overall segment is Neutral.\"\n\n**Additional Contrastive Examples:**\n* **Example 1:**\n  * Text: \"Quote: 'The outbreak is troubling, but no human infections have been detected,' stated the health commissioner.\"\n  * Correct Code: Neutral.\n  * Reasoning: \"The source provides a mild alarm cue ('troubling'). The subsequent clause states a positive fact ('no human infections detected') without explicit reassuring framing from the source. The factual counter-statement balances the initial concern, resulting in Neutral rather than Reassuring.\"\n* **Example 2:**\n  * Text: \"Quote: 'While cases have increased by 15%, testing capabilities remain adequate,' the director confirmed.\"\n  * Correct Code: Neutral.\n  * Reasoning: \"Neither clause contains explicit framing. The negative fact (case increase) and positive capability statement are both presented factually by the source without alarm or reassuring amplification. Both parts are neutrally stated, resulting in Neutral overall.\"\n\n**IMPORTANT:** If you answer \"yes\", you MUST append \"||FRAME=Alarmist\" or \"||FRAME=Reassuring\" to your rationale (exact spelling).\n\n**Regex Pattern:** \n```regex\n# same as before **but** negative‑look‑behind for technical term\n[\"'\"\"''](?<!highly\\s+pathogenic\\s)(?<!highly\\s+pathogenic\\savian\\s)(?<!hpai\\s)\n   [^\"']*\\b(catastrophic|devastating|alarming|reassuring|safe|under control|no cause for alarm)\\b[^\"']*[\"']\n```\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'.

Each element must contain: `segment_id`, `answer`, `rationale`.\nReturn NOTHING except valid JSON.\n\n### Segment 1 (ID: seg_v5_11_1001_chunk0)\nHuman infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\n\n### Segment 2 (ID: seg_v5_1_1_chunk0)\nAuthorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\n\n### Segment 3 (ID: seg_v5_4_1_chunk0)\nThe chief veterinarian for Lublin province, Pawel Piotrowski, confirmed that the deadly H5N8 virus was responsible for the turkey deaths in two farms in the village of Stary Uscimow, which lies 45 kilometers (28 miles) from the borders with Ukraine and Belarus. It was not clear how the bird flu virus found its way to the farms.\n\n### Segment 4 (ID: seg_v5_013_1003_chunk0)\nWild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\n\n### Segment 5 (ID: seg_v5_14_1002_chunk0)\nHuman infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\n\n### Segment 6 (ID: seg_v5_16_1002_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_3_100_chunk0)\nThe latest cases were at a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_002_1003_chunk0)\nInfections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_003_1003_chunk0)\nLast week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_004_1003_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials said.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_12_1000_chunk0)\nLast week, Mexico joined several other countries in banning or limiting poultry imports from Indiana following the disease outbreak.\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_1_1002_chunk0)\nAccording to the agency, bird flu was found in Fauquier County, Virginia; and in Fulton County, Kentucky, on Feb. 12, in non-poultry birds and commercial broiler chickens, respectively.\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_2_1002_chunk0)\nOn Feb. 8, bird influenza was detected in commercial turkeys in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_6_1002_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID: seg_v5_7_1002_chunk0)\nThey [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\n\n### Segment 16 (ID: seg_v5_8_1002_chunk0)\nTyson Foods Inc. confirmed that a flock of about 240,000 chickens tested positive.\n\n### Segment 17 (ID: seg_v5_12_1005_chunk0)\nThe strain now circulating is H5N1 and is related to the 2015 virus.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_13_1005_chunk0)\nIt [H5N1] has been circulating for months in Europe and Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the U.S. case was identified.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_2_1001_chunk0)\nDozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_10_1001_chunk0)\nPoultry farms in Africa, Europe, and Asia are also dealing with avian flu.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_3_10_chunk0)\nThe government did not immediately report the exact strain of bird flu that infected chickens on the farm.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_5_10_chunk0)\nAnother 34 farms are situated within a 10-kilometer (6 mile) radius of the infected location.\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_2_1005_chunk0)\nThe new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_6_1005_chunk0)\n“It’s definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry,” said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_9_1005_chunk0)\nThe 2015 outbreak led producers to kill 33 million egg-laying hens in Iowa, the nation’s leading egg producer, and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation’s leading turkey producer, with smaller outbreaks in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\n### Segment 26 (ID: seg_v5_2_1004_chunk0)\nThe United States Department of Agriculture confirmed Feb. 9 that a commercial turkey flock in Indiana was hit with avian flu, the first case in the U.S. since 2020.\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_4_1004_chunk0)\nThen on Feb. 14, the agency confirmed that a commercial flock of broiler chickens was hit with bird flu in Kentucky, and a backyard flock of mixed species fowl also tested positive in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_12_1006_chunk0)\nThe virus is spread by migratory birds and waterfowl, usually this time of year.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_16_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_26_1007_chunk0)\nThe site currently lists three cases in commercial birds during the current outbreak.\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_27_1007_chunk0)\nThis [list of cases] includes commercial turkeys, a mixed-species backyard flock in Fauquier County, Virginia, and the broiler chicken flock in Fulton County, Kentucky, belonging to Tyson foods.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_28_1007_chunk0)\nThis article and its headline were updated to clarify a barn of chickens among a flock of 240,000 birds was infected with bird flu.\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_1_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_2_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA also said HPAI was found in a backyard flock in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_3_1006_chunk0)\nLast week, the presence of HPAI was found in a commercial turkey flock of 30,000 in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 36 (ID: seg_v5_1_1007_chunk0)\nChickens in one barn among a flock of 240,000 birds belonging to Tyson Foods have become infected with a lethal form of bird flu, the company confirmed.\n\n### Segment 37 (ID: seg_v5_5_1007_chunk0)\nA spokesperson for Tyson Foods told Newsweek one barn among a flock of 240,000 in Kentucky had chickens that tested positive for bird flu.\n\n### Segment 38 (ID: seg_v5_7_1007_chunk0)\nAlthough the origin of the infection is not known, avian influenza has been found in migratory wild birds, which play a significant role in spreading the disease.'\n\n### Segment 39 (ID: seg_v5_9_1007_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 700 cases of bird flu in humans have been recorded globally since November 2003.\n\n### Segment 40 (ID: seg_v5_10_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC says that though bird flu can cross species and infect humans, this cross-transmission [bird flu crossing species and infecting humans] is rare.\n\n### Segment 41 (ID: seg_v5_11_1007_chunk0)\nInfection usually occurs as a result of infected birds shedding avian virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces which then gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled.\n\n### Segment 42 (ID: seg_v5_12_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC adds that this [infection via shedding/contact] can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or even possibly dust and a person breathes it [the virus] in, or when a person touches something that has the virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.\n\n### Segment 43 (ID: seg_v5_13_1007_chunk0)\nCross infection also usually occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses.\n\n### Segment 44 (ID: seg_v5_14_1007_chunk0)\nBut, the CDC reports some infections have been identified where direct contact was not known to have occurred.\n\n### Segment 45 (ID: seg_v5_15_1007_chunk0)\nWhen a person is infected with avian flu the resultant illness ranges from mild to severe.\n\n### Segment 46 (ID: seg_v5_16_1007_chunk0)\nIn January, Newsweek reported on a rare case of avian flu crossing over to a human in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Segment 47 (ID: seg_v5_19_1007_chunk0)\nThese infections [human infections] are concerning for non-health-related reasons, however, especially if more poultry operations in the country are found to be affected.\n\n### Segment 48 (ID: seg_v5_11_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this month, a strain of avian flu was confirmed at a commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana.\n\n### Segment 49 (ID: seg_v5_54_101_chunk0)\nIt's [culling] arguably more humane than letting them [birds] die from the virus,' Professor Kean said.\n\n### Segment 50 (ID: seg_v5_11_1009_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 51 (ID: seg_v5_13_1009_chunk0)\nIn a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 52 (ID: seg_v5_14_1009_chunk0)\nHuman infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they're considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\n\n### Segment 53 (ID: seg_v5_16_1009_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 54 (ID: seg_v5_2_1008_chunk0)\nTo date, the company is only aware of one affected house at a farm in Fulton County, Kentucky, which is one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for the company.\n\n### Segment 55 (ID: seg_v5_3_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this week, the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed the presence of bird flu in Kentucky and Virginia, reigniting fears of another widespread bird flu outbreak.\n\n### Segment 56 (ID: seg_v5_4_1008_chunk0)\nBird flu can cause high mortality rates among birds.\n\n### Segment 57 (ID: seg_v5_6_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA said it detected the presence of the virus in an undisclosed number of birds from a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 58 (ID: seg_v5_8_1008_chunk0)\nTyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 59 (ID: seg_v5_10_1008_chunk0)\nMeanwhile, a backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also tested positive for the virus.\n\n### Segment 60 (ID: seg_v5_1_1009_chunk0)\nA \"highly pathogenic\" form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\n### Segment 61 (ID: seg_v5_2_1009_chunk0)\nThe virus was detected in a small, non-commercial backyard block that was not being used for poultry purposes, the agency [USDA] said.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_10_1009_chunk0)\nIt [the detection in New York] came after the virus was discovered in flocks of birds in Kentucky, Virginia, and Indiana.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_2_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)\n#

  "thoughts": "**Analysis of Bird Flu Reporting: Q11 Application**\n\nAs an expert in the field, I've been tasked with applying Q11 to a collection of text segments regarding recent bird flu outbreaks. My primary focus is identifying whether a segment contains a dominant frame (Alarmist or Reassuring) derived from direct quotations.\n\nHere's my thought process, segment by segment:\n\n1.  **Initial Scan:** I began by swiftly scanning each segment for any quotation marks (`\"`, `'`, `\"`, `\"`, `'`, `'`). This acted as a \"Fast-Exit Guard\": If no quotation marks were present, I immediately flagged the answer as \"no\" with the rationale \"No quotation marks present.\"\n\n2.  **Quotation Analysis:** When quotation marks were detected, I delved into the quoted text, carefully evaluating whether the source within the quote expressed an explicit Alarmist or Reassuring frame. This analysis considered technical-term overrides and the need for *explicit* framing cues.\n\n3.  **Frame Determination:** To determine Alarmist vs Reassuring framing, I sought direct framing cues within quotes - alarmist cue would be an expression of risk. For Reassuring, I looked for positive or low-risk facts *explicitly framed for calm or safety*.\n\nHere's the result of my analysis:\n\n*   **Segment 24:** This segment contained a quote: `\"It’s definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry,\"`. Upon closer examination, I found the phrase \"definitely considered a period of high risk.\" The use of \"high risk\" is clearly an alarmist cue, amplified by the adverb \"definitely\".\n*   **Segment 38:** The quote, \"Although the origin of the infection is not known, avian influenza has been found in migratory wild birds, which play a significant role in spreading the disease.\" was found. This quoted text, which contained \"significant role in spreading the disease\", was a factual statement and not explicitly framed as alarmist or reassuring, so no dominant frame was identified.\n*   **Segment 49:** The quote, \"It's arguably more humane than letting them die from the virus,\" was found. This discussed the humaneness of a management decision. This segment does not meet the framing criteria. No dominant frame was identified.\n*   **Segment 52:** The quote, \"but they're considered rare,\" was found. It presented the low likelihood of the event, but did not explicitly frame the low risk fact in a way that met the definition of the SYMMETRY RULE, so it was considered neutral.\n*   **Segment 60:** The quote contained \"highly pathogenic\". This is a technical term; thus, Q11 rules rendered it a neutral quote based on the Technical-term guard.\n\nIn summary, out of the segments provided, **only segment 24 contained an explicitly framed quote with a clear Alarmist cue. All other segments were marked as neutral** due to the absence of quotes, the absence of explicit framing within the quotes, or due to the application of technical-term or low-risk factual rules.\n"
