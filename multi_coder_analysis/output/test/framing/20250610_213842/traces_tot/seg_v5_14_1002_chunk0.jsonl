{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains the word 'rare', which is not listed as a risk-adjective for Q1. It is also not modified by an intensifier or comparative.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\" My task is to evaluate this against Q1 of the 12-step decision tree for claim framing, specifically whether it contains an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nI need to look for a pattern: `(intensifier/comparative) + (risk-adjective)`.  Let's break that down.  I have a solid understanding of intensifiers and comparatives, things like \"so,\" \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"more,\" or \"less.\" The trickier part is the \"risk-adjective\" definition.  I'm given a list: \"deadly,\" \"lethal,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" \"catastrophic,\" \"brutal,\" \"contagious,\" \"virulent,\" \"destructive.\"\n\nNow, the segment uses the word \"rare.\"  Is \"rare\" a risk-adjective *in this context*?  My expert intuition tells me \"no.\"  \"Rare\" describes *frequency*, the likelihood of something happening.  The list defines *inherent risk* associated with something, how dangerous it is.  \"Deadly\" is inherently dangerous, \"contagious\" is inherently risky.  \"Rare\" is not.\n\nFurthermore, the segment includes \"considered rare.\" The word \"considered\" is not an intensifier or comparative. Even if \"rare\" were a risk-adjective, it's not being modified in the way the question is asking.\n\nTherefore, applying my knowledge of these concepts, I can confidently answer \"no\" to Q1. The segment *doesn't* contain the specified pattern: an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. My rationale is based on the precise definitions of these terms and a solid understanding of the nuances in medical claims."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the term 'rare' and the moderate verb 'occur', neither of which are high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 alarmist cues.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment: Q2 Evaluation**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants me to go through this text snippet with a fine-toothed comb, specifically looking for those red-flag phrases from Q2 of the decision tree. I know the drill: high-potency verbs that scream alarm, metaphors that paint a dire picture, superlatives paired with negative nouns, or that loaded phrase \"on high alert.\"\n\nLet me break down the text: \"Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\"\n\nAlright, I'm carefully going through the list of potent verbs: \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" \"skyrocketed,\" and so on. Nope, not a single one. Nothing here. And for the metaphors, I'm checking for things like \"ticking time-bomb,\" or \"nightmare scenario\" – nothing like that either. The superlatives with negative nouns?  \"Worst crisis,\" \"record-breaking catastrophe,\" etc.? Nope. And definitely not the phrase \"on high alert\".\n\nThe text uses \"rare\" to describe human infections.  It's technically a negative descriptor, but it doesn't have the same high-impact as the Q2 keywords. Also, the phrase is attributed to the CDC, which suggests a factual statement rather than inflammatory framing. The verb \"occur\" is neutral.\n\nSo, according to the Q2 patterns, this segment is clean. No high-potency verbs, no dramatic metaphors, no red-flag superlatives, and no \"on high alert\".  I'm ready to move on to Q3, but the prompt only wants the answer to Q2. It's a \"no\" from me."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified 'moderate verbs' paired with scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Moderate Verbs and Scale/Impact (Q3)**\n\nOkay, here's my assessment of the text segment: \"Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\"  I'm focusing specifically on Q3 of our decision tree, which asks if the text contains a \"moderate verb\" coupled with information about \"significant scale or impact.\"\n\nInitially, I scanned for any of the verbs explicitly flagged for Q3, those like *hit*, *swept*, *surged*, *plunged*, and so on.  I didn't see any of those listed. I quickly noticed \"occur\" in the phrase \"Human infections do occur\". However, 'occur' is a rather plain verb, not on the moderate list. The phrase following, \"after close contact with an infected animal\", provides context, a condition really, rather than scale or impact.\n\nI looked carefully at the sentence fragment, \"but they [human infections] are considered rare\". While \"rare\" implies a low frequency, and therefore perhaps a level of significance, it's not directly quantifiable or a dynamic verb expressing significant scale. Being \"considered rare\" leans toward a judgment of frequency or risk, potentially related to Q5 (Reassuring) or even Q8 (Neutral/Capability), depending on how we interpret the context. It definitely doesn't present the type of concrete scale or impact information the decision tree is looking for in conjunction with a moderate verb.\n\nBased on the absence of any of the Q3-defined moderate verbs, and the lack of a paired scale/impact element, my answer to Q3 is definitively \"no\".  The segment simply doesn't meet the specified criteria."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no questions, loaded or otherwise. It is a declarative statement.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Against Q4**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\"  My task is to determine if this violates Q4, which means I need to look for a loaded rhetorical question designed to instill alarm or fear.\n\nFirst, I examined the segment.  Is there a question mark? Nope. Is the sentence structured as a question? Not at all. It's a straight-up declarative statement.  It's simply stating a fact, even if it's potentially concerning (human infections from animals).  The fact that it's from the CDC also provides a degree of authority and context.\n\nGiven that there's no question, it's pretty clear this doesn't fit the criteria for a loaded rhetorical question.  The segment isn't trying to scare me or create a sense of urgency through questioning.  Therefore, my conclusion is that the answer to Q4 is \"no\".\n\nSince the prompt only asks for the Q4 response, I'm good to go with the JSON output:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The provided text segment does not contain a question. It is a declarative statement and therefore does not violate Q4, which checks for loaded rhetorical questions.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statement 'are considered rare' reports a low frequency fact but lacks explicit calming language or an intensified low-risk evaluation required for Q5.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of \"Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this snippet and need to evaluate it against Q5 of the decision tree. Q5 is all about identifying those explicit calming cues, the ones that scream \"it's safe!\", \"we're in control!\", or \"the risk is tiny!\". I'm looking for direct safety assurances, confidence statements, any kind of 'all-clear' signal.\n\nThe text says human infections \"are considered rare.\" My initial thought? *Rare* is a statement about frequency, but does it qualify as an *intensified low-risk evaluation*? Q5 gives examples like \"very low,\" \"extremely low,\" etc.  It's pretty clear those phrases are intentionally calming. \"Rare\" implies low frequency, but it doesn't have that same punch of reassurance.\n\nThe decision tree points out that \"Reassuring\" statements explicitly highlight a *very/exceptionally low* risk level to calm the audience. The regex pattern also focuses on intensifiers like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" before the word \"low\". \"Rare\" is just...well, *rare*. It's not *very* or *extremely* rare. It's just a statement of a low probability.\n\nI'm thinking about the examples.  A \"Bare Positive Fact\" like \"no cases reported\" is considered Neutral. Stating something is \"rare\" seems similar – it's a statement of fact, not an overt effort to calm.  It's just stating a low frequency, but doesn't feel like a specific attempt to calm or amplify the sense of safety. Even that 'important exclusion' example, \"The cases do not present an immediate public-health concern, the agency said,\" is marked as Neutral! Why? Because it's a bare negation statement without any additional calming amplification. It's similar to \"rare\" in that it also presents an aspect of low level concern without specific calming amplification.\n\nUltimately, while the word \"rare\" certainly indicates a low frequency, it doesn't jump the hurdle of explicit calming or intensified low-risk language. It lacks that *very/exceptionally* clear communication of *current* safety that the Reassuring category demands. So, based on the definitions and the examples provided, my answer to Q5 is a clear \"no.\" It's a statement of fact, not an explicit calming cue."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'considered rare' which indicates low frequency but does not use a specified minimiser ('only', 'just', 'merely', 'a single', 'few') in conjunction with an explicit scale contrast ('out of X').", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Minimiser + Scale Contrast (Q6)**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. The user gave me a text segment and wants me to check it against Q6, the one about the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern for reassurance.  I'm focusing specifically on that pattern.\n\nFirst, I parsed the text: \"Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\"  The key part is \"...but they are considered rare...\".\n\nNow, for Q6, I'm looking for a minimiser like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few,\" *combined with* a scale contrast – like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions.\"  The examples in the Q6 documentation are pretty explicit about this combined structure.\n\n\"Rare\" *describes* a low frequency, yes.  But does it fit the minimiser criteria?  No, it doesn't. Q6 specifically lists those few specific minimisers.  \"Rare\" is not one of them.\n\nThen, the \"scale contrast.\" Does the text offer one? No. It doesn't say \"rare *out of X*\" or \"rare *among Y*.\" The text simply states \"rare.\"\n\nSo, even though \"rare\" implies a contrast with a larger possible number of infections, it doesn't *explicitly* present the Q6 pattern.  The Q6 rule is very specific: we need *both* a specific minimiser *and* a scale contrast.  It's like a checklist, and this segment doesn't check all the boxes.\n\nGiven the strict criteria of Q6, and based on its examples, I'm forced to conclude that this segment *doesn't* meet the criteria.  I *suspect* a form of explicit calming is intended, and perhaps Q5 applies, but I *must* evaluate Q6 first and *only* Q6.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q6 is \"no\". And now I'll move on to the next question, which is what the user asked."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'are considered rare' states a low frequency factually, functioning as a bare negation without explicit calming.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\" The task is to evaluate this against Question 7 of my decision tree. Let's see... Q7 focuses on whether we have a \"bare negation\" (like \"not expected to cause problems\") without any calming cue.\n\nMy initial thought is that \"are considered rare\" definitely downplays the risk. It's not a direct negation like \"not expected,\" but it sure *functions* like one. It's essentially saying \"these infections happen, but they're *infrequent*.\" Thinking about the examples in Q7, \"considered rare\" feels analogous to something like \"unlikely to affect X\" or \"no human cases detected.\" All three are stating a low *frequency* or low *risk*. The core principle of Q7 is that such statements are Neutral unless framed with a reassuring phrase.\n\nNow, do I see any calming cues? Nope. It just states the fact that it is rare, and attributes it to the CDC. There's no \"so, don't worry\" or \"meaning the risk is very low.\"\n\nSo, I'm thinking, \"considered rare\" is a bare statement of low risk, similar to a bare negation, without any explicit calming language. This fits Q7 perfectly! It's like a cousin to those examples they provide. I'm going to answer \"Yes\" to Q7 because this is a statement of low risk *without* any additional context."}
