{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions an 'outbreak' but contains no intensifier/comparative modifying a risk-adjective, nor the fixed idiom 'deadly from the start/outset'.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: A Quick Scan and a Clear No**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with this text snippet and tasked with checking if it triggers Q1 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if it contains an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\" As an expert in this field, I know the nuances and potential pitfalls, so I approached this methodically.\n\nI quickly scanned the text: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" My eyes immediately honed in on the key elements: \"Last week,\" \"buyers,\" \"limited purchases,\" \"from Indiana,\" \"due to an outbreak,\" and \"at a commercial turkey farm.\"\n\nThe word \"outbreak\" caught my attention because it signifies a negative event, but it's crucial to understand the rules. I'm specifically looking for certain *patterns* defined by Q1. My checklist includes:\n\n*   **Intensifier + Risk-Adjective:** Think of phrases like \"extremely dangerous\" or \"highly contagious\".\n*   **Comparative + Risk-Adjective:** Phrases like \"more deadly\" or \"less severe\".\n*   **Fixed Idiom:** Specifically, \"deadly from the start/outset\".\n\nI didn't find *any* of those patterns in the text. There's no intensifier modifying a risk-adjective. There are no comparative adjectives paired with risk-adjectives. The fixed idiom is also absent. The \"outbreak\" is the primary negative point, but it's a noun describing an event.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is straightforward: the segment *doesn't* meet the criteria for Q1. My answer to the question is a firm \"no.\" My reasoning is clear, because I found no intensifiers, comparatives, or risk-adjectives in the specific ways Q1 asks for."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the moderate verb 'limited' and the noun 'outbreak', neither of which are high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases as defined for Q2.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against Q2 of the 12-Step Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, so I've been given a text segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" My task is to analyze this segment through the lens of Question 2 (Q2) of the 12-step decision tree. Essentially, I need to determine if the language used in this sentence is alarmist or hyperbolic, specifically looking for those high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert\".\n\nMy initial scan focuses on identifying those telltale signs. \"Limited\" caught my attention as the verb describing the action of the buyers. While it describes a consequence, it's not a high-potency verb like \"devastated,\" \"ravaged,\" or \"crippled,\" which would signal alarm. It's a factual statement of a restriction. The term \"outbreak\" is a negative descriptor, but it's used to state a fact, not to dramatize the situation. I didn't see any compelling metaphors, superlative + negative noun pairings, or the \"on high alert\" phrase.\n\nTherefore, after a thorough review based on the defined patterns in the Q2 Pattern Recognition Table and Regex Pattern, I'm confident in concluding that this segment does *not* utilize any of the alarmist language patterns specified in Q2. So, the answer is \"no,\" and I can now proceed accordingly."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with explicit scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Analysis: A Quick Diagnostic**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and tasked with evaluating it against Q3 of the decision tree. My focus here is on identifying \"moderate verbs\" that signal significant impact, coupled with concrete scale or impact information.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the relevant segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" I've got that.\n\nNext, I'm mentally running through the list of moderate verbs I've internalized – the ones in the regex and examples: *hit*, *swept*, *surged*, *soared*, *plunged*, *plummeted*, *prompted*, *feared*, *fearing*, and *were/was culled*.  I'm looking for those within the segment.\n\nScanning the text, I see \"limited.\"  *Limited* isn't in the list of moderate verbs I'm hunting for.  I also see \"outbreak\". *Outbreak* describes the event, but isn't a verb describing its impact like Q3 requires.\n\nEven if I *did* find a moderate verb, I need to make sure it's paired with that explicit, significant scale or impact detail.  This segment mentions \"an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm\" and \"limited poultry purchases.\" It describes *where* the outbreak occurred and its consequence (limited purchases), but there's no mention of the specific magnitude of impact, like \"millions culled,\" \"record losses,\" or \"thousands affected.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the presence of the required verb and the lack of explicit scale/impact data, the answer to Q3 is a definite \"no.\""}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain any question, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and asked to evaluate it based on Question 4 of this decision tree. Q4 is all about identifying those pesky loaded rhetorical questions that scream \"alarm!\" The segment I'm looking at reads: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nRight off the bat, I scan it for any question marks or question-like phrasing. I'm looking for anything that tries to insinuate concern without directly stating it. But, no, it's a straightforward declarative sentence. It simply states a fact, that poultry purchases were limited. There's no hint of a question, loaded or otherwise.\n\nSo, according to the decision tree's rules for Q4, since there's no question present, I'm confident in answering \"no.\" I'll need to remember to articulate that clearly in my JSON output – the lack of a question is the deciding factor here, so that needs to be my rationale. Now, on to Q5!"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (outbreak leading to limited purchases) neutrally, without any explicit calming language or reassurance cues.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment Against Q5**\n\nOkay, I'm being asked to apply the 12-step decision tree, specifically Question Q5, to this text segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" My expert eye needs to discern if there's an explicit calming cue here, as defined by the rules and examples provided.\n\nScanning the text, it's clear the segment describes a negative event and its consequences, but it does so in a strictly factual manner. I'm looking for those specific reassuring patterns, the \"no cause for alarm\" phrases, the confidence statements, the preparedness cues, the risk-minimizing intensifiers, and the positive amplification. None of those are present. This segment simply states the outbreak and the subsequent trade limitations. It doesn't attempt to explicitly soothe anxieties or minimize perceived risk.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion, after thorough review, is that the answer to Q5 is \"no.\" This lack of explicit calming cues necessitates moving to Q6 (although I don't need to do that here). But for now, the JSON response, given the prompt's instructions, should be, `{\"answer\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No explicit calming cues or reassurances were identified in the text segment.\"}`"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm' but does not use a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) or explicitly contrast this single location against a larger scale to downplay the event.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for the 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' Pattern**\n\nOkay, so I need to check this segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there,\" against Q6, which is all about the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern for reassuring framing.\n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The text describes a situation where purchases are limited due to an outbreak. Now, I need to see if it uses that pattern to reassure the reader.\n\nI'm looking for a minimiser, like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"a few,\" coupled with a scale contrast, perhaps something like \"out of thousands of farms\" or \"nationwide\". I'm looking for a sentence structure that's aiming to downplay the impact.\n\nLet's see. Does this segment have a minimiser? Nope. Nothing like \"only one farm\" or \"just a small outbreak.\"\n\nOkay, how about a scale contrast? \"At a commercial turkey farm there\" does imply a single location, but it's not explicitly contrasted with a larger context to downplay the significance. It doesn't use the 'out of thousands' type language, or something similar to make it look like a limited issue in the grand scheme of things.\n\nSo, while the segment mentions a single location of the outbreak, it doesn't utilize a minimiser alongside it, or a scale contrast in a way that minimizes the event. It's just stating a fact.\n\nTherefore, Q6 is not satisfied. The answer is \"no\". The rationale will reflect this, emphasizing the absence of the 'minimiser + scale contrast' combination needed for reassuring framing, specifically that there's no minimizer, and the scale is not contrasted in a downplaying manner."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a factual event (buyers limiting purchases due to an outbreak) and does not contain any bare negation or downplaying language.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Against Q7**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with checking this text against the decision tree's Q7. This is the one that looks for \"bare negation\" without any calming cues, right? I need to scour the text for phrases that try to downplay a risk or problem – things like \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no evidence,\" that sort of thing.\n\nThe text is: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nRight off the bat, I see the text clearly describes a negative event (the outbreak) and its direct consequence (the purchasing limits). It's a straightforward presentation of the facts.  I'm not seeing any attempts to minimize the situation or cushion the blow. There are *definitely* no phrases like \"it's not expected to spread,\" \"the risk is negligible,\" or \"this won't impact our supply.\"\n\nSince there's no negation or downplaying language present, there's no way this could be a 'bare negation'.  Therefore, based on my expert understanding and rapid assessment, the answer to Q7 is definitively \"no.\" It's a pretty clear-cut case. While I would normally continue to Q8, the prompt only requires the answer to Q7.\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The text segment directly describes a negative event (an outbreak) and its consequence (limited purchases) without using any negating or downplaying language.

Let's break it down: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nRight off the bat, I see this is about an event: the limitation of poultry purchases because of an outbreak. It's essentially reporting a negative fact (the outbreak) and its consequence (purchase limits).\n\nI went through the checklist in my head: capabilities? Nope. Preparedness measures? Doesn't seem like it. Hopeful possibilities? Negative. Safeguards? Not mentioned. There are *consequences*.\n\nI'm thinking, based on this, it's pretty clear that this segment doesn't describe any of the items Q8 is looking for, which are basically proactive or positive elements. It just states the past event and the result. No actions by officials or improved systems are listed.\n\nTherefore, this isn't a \"Capability/Preparedness Statement without Active Reassurance\". So, my answer to Q8 is going to be \"no\".\n\nHere's the JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment describes a past event and its consequence, not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes an action ('limited poultry purchases') rather than reporting specific prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs as required by Q9.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and asked to evaluate it based on Question 9 of the decision tree. Q9, as I understand it, is looking for factual reporting of prices or economic metrics, using standard verbs in a neutral tone, and *excluding* any vivid language or framing.\n\nThe segment in question is: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n*   It clearly touches on economic activity - \"poultry purchases\" and \"buyers.\"\n*   However, it *doesn't* offer any specific prices, economic figures, or numerical data points. No percentages, no dollar amounts, nothing like that.\n*   It *doesn't* employ standard economic verbs like \"rose,\" \"declined,\" or \"increased.\"\n*   It *doesn't* use any overly dramatic verbs like \"skyrocketed\" or \"plummeted.\"\n*   There's no use of risk-focused adjectives like \"catastrophic\" or \"devastating.\"\n*   The overall tone is quite neutral; there's no deliberate attempt to alarm or reassure.\n\nEssentially, the segment describes an action: buyers *limited* purchases. While there are obvious economic implications (reduced trade), the focus is on a *cause and effect* relationship: an outbreak *caused* the limitations. It is not a direct report on some state of the market, e.g., using economic terminology.\n\nQ9 specifies \"reporting prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs\". This segment doesn't quite match that. It describes an *action* (\"limited purchases\"), not a *metric* like \"purchases fell by X%.\"\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding of Q9, I must conclude that the answer is \"no\". This segment does not primarily report prices or metrics in the way the decision tree intends. The next step is to proceed to Q10."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a past event (buyers limiting purchases last week) and its cause (an outbreak), but does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to analyze this text snippet against Question Q10 of the decision tree. The core of Q10 is this: does the segment *speculate* about future relief or improvement without explicitly calming the current situation? My initial instinct is to dissect the language closely and look for any clues.\n\nThe segment is: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nRight off the bat, I recognize this describes a past event. \"Last week\" anchors it firmly in the past. It's simply stating that buyers, specifically China and Korea, *limited* purchases because of an outbreak. That's a cause-and-effect statement about a past action.\n\nNow, does it speculate? Let's break it down further. \"Limited poultry purchases\" is a description of a *past* action. \"Due to an outbreak\" explains the *reason* for that past action. The final part, specifying the location, adds context.\n\nThere's no mention of what will happen *next*. No anticipation of easing restrictions, returning to normal trade, or improvement in the situation. No, \"we expect things to get better soon\", or \"hopefully, they resume purchases later\" statements. The absence of such future-oriented language is key.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is clear: this segment doesn't speculate about future relief or improvement. It's a factual statement about a past event and its cause.\n\nBased on the rules of Q10, a \"no\" answer means I need to move on to Q11. That's straightforward enough. The \"no\" needs to be reflected in my output, along with a clear rationale - which I've just articulated. I have sufficient detail to create an acceptable JSON output."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no direct quotes or attributed statements from a source using explicit framing language.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Dominant Framed Quotations (Q11)**\n\nOkay, the task is to assess this text snippet against Q11 of the decision tree, which is all about identifying a dominant, framing quotation.  Let's see: *\"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"*\n\nFirst, I'll quickly scan for any direct quotes or explicitly attributed statements that might use alarmist or reassuring language, you know, those phrases like \"extremely concerning\" or \"no cause for alarm\" that we're looking for.  Nope, nothing jumping out.\n\nSecond, given that, the text doesn't contain any direct quotes or attributions.  It's just a straightforward reporting of events, a simple factual statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q11 has to be \"no\".\n\nAnd the rationale?  Well, there simply aren't any direct quotes or clearly attributed statements that use a framing language within the provided text segment. Simple as that.

{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports factual events (limited purchases, outbreak) using neutral, descriptive language without explicit framing cues.", "thoughts": "**Neutral Framing Analysis: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with assessing this text against Q12 of our claim framing decision tree – the \"default-to-Neutral\" check. My goal is to determine if, after meticulously checking all the preceding rules (Q1-Q11), this segment contains *no* remaining explicit and sufficient Alarmist or Reassuring cues. If it's purely factual, it's Neutral. Let's break it down:\n\nThe segment in question is: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nRight away, I'm thinking, \"Is this framing the situation as positive or negative?\" So I go through the motions of checking the rules:\n\n*   **Q1-Q3 (Intensifiers, Vivid Verbs, Moderate Verbs with Scale):** Nothing there. No hyperbole, no visually impactful language to describe the *effect* of the outbreak. \"Limited\" is a neutral word. \"Outbreak\" is a standard description.\n*   **Q4-Q5 (Explicit Calming, Reassuring):** Nope. No attempts to downplay the situation or offer comfort. No reassurance about confidence or preparedness.\n*   **Q6-Q7 (Alarmist, Bare Negation):** Negative. No threat amplification, no negated negatives.\n*   **Q8-Q11 (Capability, Factual Metrics, Relief, Uncertainty):** Not applicable. No mentions of capability, price changes, expectations of future improvement, or uncertainty.\n\nNow, we've arrived at Q12. This is key. The segment *does* describe negative events: limited purchases (a consequence) and an outbreak (the cause). However, it's crucial how these facts are *presented*. We need to ask: Are the words in this frame making the events sound worse, or are they reporting them neutrally?\n\nBased on my analysis of the 11 framing guidelines and looking at Q12, the answer is clear: the segment provides factual information about negative events. \"Limited poultry purchases\" and \"outbreak\" are negative facts, but not presented with any framing bias. The presentation is purely descriptive.\n\nTherefore, since the presentation is purely factual, and there are *no* remaining explicit and sufficient Alarmist or Reassuring cues, Q12 is \"Yes.\" The frame is, by default, Neutral. This is consistent with the \"Severe Fact, Neutral Presentation\" example we use in training. This presentation is about the facts, and only the facts. There is no added framing, positive or negative."}
