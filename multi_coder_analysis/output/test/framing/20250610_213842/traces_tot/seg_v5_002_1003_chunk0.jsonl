{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes consequences ('more restrictions', 'blocking') but does not use an intensifier or comparative adjective to modify a risk-adjective describing the infection itself.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Intensified Risk-Adjectives**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this text segment now. My task is to see if it meets the criteria of Q1 in our 12-step decision tree. That means I need to hunt for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. I'm essentially looking for phrases that amp up the danger or severity, something like \"extremely severe\", \"more dangerous\", or \"very risky.\"\n\nLet's break down the segment: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\"\n\n*   \"Infections\": Nope, that's not a risk-adjective in itself, and there's no intensifier or comparative modifying it.\n*   \"triggered more restrictions\": \"More\" is a comparative, but \"restrictions\" isn't a descriptor of the infection's inherent danger. It's describing the consequences, the actions taken.\n*   \"blocking poultry products\": Again, no luck here. This is a description of an action, not the nature of the risk.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I have to conclude that the segment doesn't contain the pattern we're looking for. It describes factual events and consequences related to the chicken infections but doesn't use intensified or comparative risk-adjectives to explicitly portray their dangerousness or severity. The infections themselves aren't characterized in a way that falls under Q1's requirements.\n\nMy answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\""}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verbs 'triggered' and 'blocking' are moderate and factual, not high-potency verbs or potent metaphors as defined by Q2 rules.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Evaluation: A Concise Summary**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and the task is clear: evaluate it against the Q2 criteria of this decision tree. My initial focus goes straight to identifying any \"red flags\" – the high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative noun combos, or that \"on high alert\" phrase.\n\nI've got the text: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\"\n\nRight off the bat, I see the verbs \"triggered\" and \"blocking.\" I mentally run through the list of high-potency verbs in the Q2 table. \"Triggered\" and \"blocking\" don't make the cut. They are direct action words, but the language isn't designed to alarm. They simply present an objective cause-and-effect: infections initiated restrictions, and China then implemented a block.\n\nThere are no metaphors, no negative superlative pairings, and the \"on high alert\" phrase is conspicuously absent.  So, based on this careful scan, and in light of my professional understanding of the framework, my answer to Q2 must be \"no.\""}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses factual verbs ('triggered', 'blocking') and describes consequences ('more restrictions', 'blocking poultry products') without using moderate verbs from the list or explicitly detailing significant scale/impact as required by Q3.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against Decision Tree Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" My task is to determine if this meets the criteria of Q3 in the decision tree. That means I need to see if it includes a \"moderate verb\" (as defined by a specific list or regex I have) coupled with information that indicates *significant* scale or impact.\n\nFirst, I quickly identify the verbs: \"triggered\" and \"blocking.\" Then I check my list of moderate verbs. Neither \"triggered\" nor \"blocking\" are on it. That's a key initial observation.\n\nNext, I look for any language that suggests significant scale or impact. I see \"more restrictions\" and \"blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" \"More restrictions\" implies an increase, but it lacks specific quantification. How many more restrictions? What's the relative severity? \"Blocking poultry products from Kentucky\" is a specific action, a consequence, but doesn't, on its own, scream \"significant impact\" in the same way something like \"millions culled\" or \"record losses\" would. It's simply a factual statement of what happened.\n\nPutting it all together, I conclude that the segment doesn't meet Q3's criteria. It doesn't use a moderate verb (from the predefined list) and the impact descriptors are more factual statements of events than indications of *significant* scale or impact.  Therefore, I'd confidently answer \"no\" to Q3."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Q4 - Not Applicable**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" And I need to assess this against Q4, which focuses on loaded rhetorical questions that try to induce alarm. I understand Q4's criteria: it's looking for questions that implicitly raise concerns or fears, unlike neutral inquiries.\n\nFirst, I scrutinized the segment. It's a straightforward statement detailing the consequences of a health issue in poultry. *No questions are present*. Absolutely none. Q4 is immediately irrelevant.\n\nGiven that, I don't need to consider whether the statement contains loaded *rhetorical* questions. It simply doesn't contain any questions. Therefore, the answer is unequivocally \"no.\" The segment doesn't meet the condition of Q4.\n\nHere's how I'd format my conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The provided text segment does not contain any questions. Therefore, it cannot contain loaded rhetorical questions, which is the condition that Q4 evaluates.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes negative events (infections, restrictions, trade block) and contains no explicit language from the author or a source intended to calm concerns, assure safety, or minimize perceived risk.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Claim Framing: Q5 - Reassuring Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to assess it based on the criteria for Question 5 of the decision tree. That's the one that's all about identifying explicitly reassuring language, those comforting phrases that signal safety and control.\n\nMy expert eye immediately sees a problem. The segment, describing those chicken infections and the subsequent trade restrictions, is painting a pretty negative picture. It's all about limitations and blocks - the exact opposite of what Q5 is looking for.\n\nI'm checking for those key phrases, those \"no need to worry\" kind of signals, and they're just not there. \"Don't panic,\" \"it's under control,\" \"completely safe\" - none of those are showing up. There's nothing about the public resting easy or any confidence being exuded regarding the situation. It’s purely factual, reporting the negative consequences.\n\nThe language is factual, descriptive, and leans towards the challenges of the situation. It’s important to note the absence of any preparedness cues linked to public safety.\n\nSo, based on that, the answer to Q5 has to be a definite \"no.\" The segment completely lacks any explicit calming cues that reassure the audience about present safety, control, or a significantly minimized present risk. It's a straightforward assessment based on the absence of those specific elements we're looking for. The rationale is the absence of calming language."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes negative events (infections, restrictions, blocking exports) but does not use a minimiser (like 'only', 'just', 'few') combined with a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'among millions') to downplay the significance.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Against Q6**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with assessing this text against Question 6 of the decision tree. Q6, as I understand it, is looking for a specific linguistic pattern: the presence of a *minimiser* combined with a *scale contrast*, a combination often employed for reassurance.  Essentially, we're looking for phrases like \"only a few cases out of thousands,\" where the minimiser (\"only\", \"few\") works in tandem with a scale comparison to downplay the significance of the negative information.\n\nI've carefully examined the text: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\"  My expert eye immediately scanned for any sign of this pattern. I broke down the sentence and analyzed each section:\n\n*   \"Infections in the chickens...\" - No minimisers like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"a single.\" No scale contrast.\n*   \"...triggered more restrictions...\" - Still no minimisers or contrasting scales.\n*   \"...with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" - And again, nothing.\n\nThe text presents a factual description of a negative situation: infections lead to export restrictions. However, it does so without employing any of the telltale linguistic cues we're looking for.  There's no attempt to minimize the impact by using words like \"only\" or \"just\" in conjunction with a larger scale.  Therefore, I'm confident in concluding that the pattern \"minimiser + scale contrast\" is *not* present.\n\nFollowing the decision tree's logic, a \"no\" answer to Q6 dictates we proceed to the next question, Q7. But for this specific task, I'm only asked to provide the Q6 answer. Thus, my response is \"no.\""}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes negative events (infections, restrictions, blocking exports) and does not contain any bare negation or statement downplaying a risk.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm diving into this text snippet to see if it triggers any red flags related to Q7 of the decision tree. Q7, as I understand it, is all about spotting \"bare negations\" - those instances where a statement negates something without offering any kind of reassurance or mitigation. I need to keep an eye out for phrases that downplay or dismiss potential risks, like \"not a problem,\" \"unlikely,\" or \"no threat.\"\n\nThe text in question: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" It's pretty straightforward. It's painting a picture of some negative consequences: infections, export restrictions, and a trade blockage. But I'm not seeing any phrases that try to soften the blow. No \"don't worry,\" no \"it's under control,\" just a statement of fact.\n\nSince there's no negation *at all*, it's a clear \"No\" for Q7. It's a statement about negative events, but it doesn't try to sugarcoat or downplay them. I'll need to move on to Q8."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a problem and its consequences (infections, restrictions, blocking exports), not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question 8**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this text snippet against Question 8 of the decision tree. My initial impression is that this is straightforward, but let's be methodical.  The text segment is: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\"\n\nMy job is to determine if this describes capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards *without* explicitly linking them to current calm, safety, or minimized risk.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the criteria. Am I seeing any mention of capabilities? No. Preparedness measures? Not in sight.  Hopeful future possibilities? Absolutely not.  Implemented safeguards?  Again, no. The segment clearly describes a negative event and its immediate consequence.\n\nThe question explicitly asks about content *that describes* capabilities or the like.  This segment doesn't contain that *type* of content at all.  It's simply reporting a problem and a reaction to it.  The idea of \"without explicitly linking to calm\" is moot because the *primary* condition—does it describe capabilities, etc.—isn't met. I can't consider the second part (the \"without\" part) because I haven't established the first part (the \"does describe\" part).\n\nLet's re-read the examples. \"Officials are working to contain,\" \"vaccine can be made in X weeks,\" \"systems are in place.\" Those examples are all about actively *managing* the situation or preparing for it. This text is about the *situation itself*.  It's reporting a problem (infections, export restrictions), not a response to the problem.\n\nTherefore, the segment doesn't fall into the category of content that Q8 is designed to evaluate. It's simply not what the question is asking about. Logically, given the decision tree structure, if a segment *doesn't* fit the *type* of content the question is looking for, the correct answer is a clear \"no,\" and I should proceed to Q9.\n\nGiven the instructions, and my analysis, my answer to Q8 is \"no.\" My rationale: The segment describes a problem and its consequences, not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards. That's what I'll document in my output."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports trade restrictions resulting from infections, but does not report prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs as required by Q9.", "thoughts": "**Evaluation of Text Segment Against Q9**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My task is to evaluate this text snippet – \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky\" – against Q9 of the decision tree. Q9, as I understand it, is looking for segments that *primarily* report on prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using specific, rather neutral language.  We're checking for that *standard descriptive* approach, but excluding any vivid or overly dramatic language, risk assessments, or framing that would color the economic picture explicitly.\n\nMy initial thought is that the segment *does* touch on trade and, implicitly, economic activity.  We see \"restrictions on U.S. exports\" and \"blocking poultry products\". However, upon closer inspection, it's not reporting any *specific* numbers or economic figures. There are no percentages, dollar amounts, index points, or the typical economic verbs we'd expect like \"rose,\" \"declined,\" \"increased,\" or \"fell.\" It's describing an action – the consequence of the infections – not reporting data points themselves.\n\nThe verbs used are descriptive of actions (\"triggered,\" \"blocking\"), linked to a non-economic event (the infections). This is the key. The segment describes a *consequence* (trade restrictions) stemming from something *outside* of the economic realm, framing it in terms of action rather than specific data. I don't see any of the \"skyrocketed,\" \"plummeted,\" or \"catastrophic\" language that Q9 explicitly screens for, nor is there any explicitly reassuring framing.\n\nSo, in essence, I don't think this segment fits the pattern Q9 is after. It's not *primarily* reporting prices or economic data in the way Q9 defines. Therefore, the answer should be \"no\". The rationale boils down to the fact that while it's related to economics, it's not focusing on reporting economic metrics or prices in the way Q9 is looking for, using standard, neutral descriptive language."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes current negative events (infections, restrictions, blocking) and does not speculate about potential future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating Text Against Decision Tree Question Q10**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with a text segment and need to determine its relevance to Question Q10 in the decision tree. Q10 is concerned with whether the segment speculates about future relief or improvement without offering any explicit calming cues about the present situation. I know this type of analysis well.\n\nThe segment in question reads: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\"\n\nMy initial thought is to break this down. The segment clearly outlines a *current* negative scenario: infections are leading to export restrictions and outright bans. My expertise immediately tells me to look for keywords that suggest future speculation. I'm trained to look for modal verbs like \"may,\" \"could,\" \"might,\" or phrases hinting at potential for things to ease up in the future. The absence of such indicators is immediately apparent.\n\nI'm not seeing any language that hints at the temporary nature of these restrictions, potential for recovery, or any sort of timeline for resolution. There's no speculation whatsoever about future improvement. It's a straightforward statement of a current problem, no more, no less.\n\nTherefore, according to my expert judgment, this segment *does not* meet the criteria for Q10. The answer is definitively \"no.\" The segment doesn't speculate about future relief.\nNow, the prompt directs me to the next hop in the decision tree if the answer is \"no,\" which is Q11. However, the task is specifically to answer Q10. I'll provide the JSON response based on my analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment describes a current negative event (export restrictions due to infections) and does not contain any speculation about potential future relief or improvement. It lacks any language hinting at the temporary nature of the issue or a future resolution.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no direct quotes or attributed statements to evaluate for explicit framing.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Explicit Framing in a Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I've got it. The task is to evaluate this text against the Q11 criteria in the decision tree. Q11 focuses on identifying a dominant, *explicitly framed* quotation within the provided text segment. My primary goal here is to determine whether the segment contains a direct quote or a clearly attributed statement that utilizes alarmist or reassuring language, as defined in the established rules.\n\nFirst, I'll read the segment: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\"\n\nMy initial step is to scan for quotation marks or clear attribution that would indicate a source's statement. I'm looking for anything that points to a specific person or entity making a direct quote. In this particular instance, there are no quotation marks, and there's no attribution to a specific source. The text simply describes events: \"Infections triggered...\", \"China blocking...\".\n\nSince there's no direct quote or attributed statement present, I won't have anything to evaluate for potential framing (alarmist or reassuring language).\n\nThe question in Q11 is specifically about whether a *quoted source* provides a frame. Because there are no quotes in this segment, the answer to Q11 is definitively \"no\".\n\nMy rationale will need to clearly state that the segment lacks any direct quotes. I'll then move onto the next step in the decision tree. I won't need to add `||FRAME=...` because the answer is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Factual reporting of negative events (infections, restrictions, blocking) without explicit alarmist or reassuring framing cues.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment: This Segment Defaults to Neutral**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky,\" with Q12 of the claim framing decision tree in mind. My task is to determine if, after going through the first eleven questions, there are *no* explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues, leading to a default Neutral frame.\n\nLet's break it down. \"Infections in the chickens\" is just a factual statement – it's a negative event, but the *presentation* is neutral. No sensationalism there. Similarly, \"triggered more restrictions\" and \"blocking poultry products\" are simply describing consequences, again, factually.\n\nI'm scanning for those tell-tale signs: intensifiers, vivid impact verbs, exaggeration, loaded metaphors for Alarmist framing, or explicit calming language for Reassuring. I'm not seeing any. Nothing like \"devastating\" or \"soared\" or \"catastrophic.\" No attempts to downplay the situation with phrases like \"no need to worry\" or \"under control.\"\n\nThis feels very straightforward. The Bedrock Principle and Symmetry Rule come into play here. We're dealing with negative facts – infections and trade restrictions – but they're presented in a purely descriptive manner. The severity of the *facts* is undeniable, but the *framing* is neutral. Q12 explicitly reinforces this: factual reporting of severe facts without additional alarmist rhetoric results in a Neutral frame.\n\nSo, the answer to Q12 is a resounding \"yes.\" There are no explicit Alarmist or Reassuring framing cues present. The text defaults to Neutral. The rationale is clear: the facts are presented factually, without any explicit framing cues that would push it toward either Alarmist or Reassuring."}
