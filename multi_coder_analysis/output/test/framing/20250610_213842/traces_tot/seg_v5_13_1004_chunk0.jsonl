{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains the risk-adjective 'deadly' but it is not modified by an intensifier or comparative adjective as required by Q1.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Segment Against Q1 of the Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this text segment and need to check it against Q1 of the claim-framing decision tree. The goal is to see if there's an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk adjective. I need to keep an eye out for patterns like `(intensifier/comparative) + risk-adjective`.\n\nFirst, I need to remind myself of the lists of risk adjectives and intensifiers/comparatives. I have those handy, so let's start scanning the text: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\"\n\n\"Does not present a food safety risk\" - Okay, that's about risk, but it's a negation, so I can ignore that. \"Potential of being deadly to domestic fowl\" - Hmm, \"deadly\" *is* a risk adjective. But, is it intensified? No. The phrase \"potential of being\" is describing possibility, not the degree of deadliness. It just states that the virus *is* deadly. My rules say \"deadly\" on its own is neutral.\n\n\"Threatens to spark shortages\" - Nope, \"threatens\" is a vivid verb, but not an intensifier. This probably has something to do with Q2.\n\n\"Further increase in prices\" - Well, \"increase\" isn't a risk adjective, and \"further\" is a comparative, but it's modifying the *increase* itself, not a risk adjective.\n\n\"Amid soaring inflation\" - \"Soaring\" is definitely vivid language, but it's describing the *context* (inflation), not the virus's direct impact. The rules say to ignore that for Alarmist coding.\n\nSo, after going through the segment, I don't see any instance where an intensifier or comparative directly modifies a risk adjective. \"Deadly\" is present, but it's not being modified in that way.\n\nTherefore, Q1 is \"no.\" I'll need to encode this into JSON, including the rationalization."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'threatens to spark' which is not on the list of high-potency verbs or metaphors that trigger Q2.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking through this, based on the provided text segment and the Q2 criteria: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\"\n\nMy task is to look for specific patterns: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert\".  I've got a regex and the explicit list of high-potency verbs to guide me.\n\nFirst, I identified \"threatens to spark\" as a verb phrase.  But then I went back to the definition and the provided examples (\"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" \"skyrocketed,\" etc.).  \"Threatens to spark\" is about *potential* impact, not the vivid, dramatic impact described by those examples.  It's a conditional statement about a potential future event, not a forceful description of a current one. The regex is equally strong, and \"threatens to spark\" isn't included.\n\nThe phrase \"deadly to domestic fowl\" caught my eye.  \"Deadly\" is a potent *adjective*, but Q2 specifically wants *verbs* or *metaphors*.  It seems that this type of adjective is relevant to Q1 (Intensifier + Risk-Adjective) and thus not the focus here.\n\nFinally, \"soaring inflation\".  I was mindful of the instruction to ignore \"soaring\" when it modifies a background condition.  In this case, it modifies \"inflation\".\n\nConsidering the explicit list of high-potency verbs, the regex, the specific criteria of Q2, and the emphasis on strong, vivid language framing, I've concluded that \"threatens to spark\" does not qualify.  There are no potent metaphors, superlative/negative nouns, or \"on high alert.\" I'll move on to Q3 with a \"no\" for Q2."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text uses 'threatens to spark' and 'increase', which are not on the Q3 moderate verb list. 'Soaring' describes a background condition (inflation), not the threat's direct impact.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Decision Tree Q3**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with assessing this text snippet against Q3 of the decision tree. I need to see if it contains \"moderate verbs\" alongside information about \"significant scale or impact,\" and crucially, if that impact is *realized*, not just a possibility.\n\nFirst, I identified the segment: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\"\n\nNext, I scanned for any of the moderate verbs from the Q3 list: `hit`, `swept`, `surged`, `soared`, `plunged`, `plummeted`, `prompted`, `feared`, `fearing`, `were/was culled`.\n\nI spotted \"threatens to spark,\" \"increase,\" and \"soaring\" (in \"soaring inflation\").\n\n\"Threatens to spark\" looks like a potential candidate, but it's *potential* impact, a plan or future event, not something that's already happened.  The Q3 rule specifically needs realized impact. Neither \"threatens\" or \"spark\" are on the list of moderate verbs.\n\nThen there's \"increase,\" which isn't on the moderate verb list.\n\nFinally, \"soaring\" caught my eye, but it's part of \"soaring inflation.\" That describes a *background condition*, not the direct impact of the threat itself. The context guard for vivid language rule is pretty clear: we can ignore vivid language in this context.\n\nTherefore, none of these verbs in this text are a match for Q3's criteria. I have to say \"no\" to Q3."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text segment contains statements but no questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Decision Tree Q4**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with evaluating this text snippet against Q4 of the decision tree. Q4's looking specifically for those loaded rhetorical questions designed to induce alarm. I need to comb through this text with a fine-tooth comb.\n\nThe text reads, \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\"\n\nAlright, I'm carefully reading through it, looking for any hint of a question, a rhetorical jab designed to raise alarm bells.  It's outlining some risks: it's deadly to fowl, it *could* lead to shortages of poultry and eggs, and it *could* drive up prices even further, which is, obviously, undesirable, especially with inflation.  But I'm not seeing any questions. Not a single one. It's all declarative statements and potential consequences, rather than anything posed as a question to the reader.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion, based on my expert understanding of rhetoric and the specific criteria of Q4, is \"no\". No loaded rhetorical questions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The provided text segment does not contain any questions, particularly loaded rhetorical questions designed to imply alarm, as required by Q4 of the decision tree. While the text outlines risks and potential negative consequences, it does so using declarative statements.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'does not present a food safety risk' is a bare negation of a risk under a condition, not an explicit calming cue or intensified low-risk evaluation as required by Q5.", "thoughts": "**Q5 Analysis: Identifying Explicit Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm evaluating this text segment against Q5 of the decision tree, which is all about spotting explicit calming cues that reassure the public about safety and control.  I need to see if it uses language like \"no cause for alarm,\" \"rest easy,\" or similar phrases.\n\nThe segment states: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked...\"  My gut reaction is that this *feels* like a reassurance about food safety, but I need to be precise.  So, I start going down the list of Q5 patterns: \"no cause for alarm,\" \"public can rest easy,\" etc. None of those match, obviously.  It's not an intensified low-risk statement either â€“ it's a direct negation (\"does not present a risk\"), not an amplification of low risk.\n\nThe Q5 guidance specifically *excludes* bare negations of risk, like the example:  \"The cases do not present an immediate public-health concern.\"  The reasoning is that these bare negations are addressed in other parts of the tree (like Q7).  And that's the key here.  \"Does not present a food safety risk\" is exactly that: a bare negation. It's a statement of fact, but it doesn't *reassure* in the way Q5 is looking for. It just negates a risk.\n\nSo, although it's *intended* to be reassuring, it doesn't meet the criteria for Q5.  My answer has to be \"no\". It's likely a bare negation that will be evaluated at a later stage."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a 'minimiser' (only, just, merely, a single, few) combined with an explicit 'scale contrast' (out of X, among Y) to downplay an event.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this text segment and need to check it against Q6, which is looking for that \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" combo to downplay something for reassurance. I know this inside and out, so let's get started.\n\nFirst, I quickly read through the text: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\"\n\nMy first thought is, this seems pretty negative overall. Let's dig in. I need to spot a \"minimiser\" (like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely\") coupled with some kind of \"scale contrast\" (something like \"out of,\" \"nationwide,\" etc.).  I'm scanning for that specific pattern.\n\n*   \"does not present a food safety risk\" - Straightforward negation, not what I'm looking for. That's more like Q7 or Q8.\n*   \"potential of being deadly\" - More negativity, no sign of a minimiser or scale contrast.\n*   \"threatens to spark shortages\" - Again, negative, but no Q6 clues.\n*   \"further increase in prices\" -  Still nothing.\n*   \"amid soaring inflation\" - Just context, ignoring this according to the guard.\n\nBasically, there's no \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely\" anywhere, and no contrasting scale to go with it. So, after a thorough review, I have to conclude that this segment does *not* fit the Q6 criteria. The answer is a clear \"no.\"  I'll build the JSON with that as the answer and explain the logic."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'does not present a food safety risk' is a bare negation without an explicit calming cue.", "thoughts": "**Evaluation of Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question 7**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment to analyze, and I need to see if it triggers Q7 in the decision tree. Q7's all about \"bare negations\" - things like \"not a risk\" - without any reassuring statements attached.\n\nI spot \"does not present a food safety risk\". That definitely fits the bill, it's a direct negation of a potential risk. Now, the key is whether there's a calming statement after it. The text mentions cooking food properly, but that's just a condition; it doesn't give a feeling of reassurance. Then the rest of the sentence talks about negative impacts. So, it's a bare negation.\n\nSince it's a bare negation and there's no calming cue, the answer to Q7 is \"yes\".  The rationale is straightforward: the phrase \"does not present a food safety risk\" is a bare negation without any calming statements to qualify it.  I'm done here, since Q7 is triggered, and I need to output the JSON now."}
