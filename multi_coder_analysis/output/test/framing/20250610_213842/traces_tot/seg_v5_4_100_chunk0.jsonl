{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'so' modifying the risk-adjectives 'infectious' and 'deadly'.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment for Q1 of the Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Because the virus is so infectious and deadly for commercial poultry, entire flocks are destroyed and composted on the farms when they [entire flocks] are infected.\" My task is to evaluate this against Q1, looking for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.  I'm focusing on that `intensifier/comparative + risk-adjective` pattern.\n\nI know my lists of relevant terms: intensifiers like \"so,\" \"very,\" and comparatives like \"more,\" and then risk-adjectives such as \"deadly\" and \"infectious.\" Scanning the segment, I immediately spot two potential matches: \"so infectious\" and \"deadly.\"\n\nLet's break it down. With \"so infectious,\" \"so\" is an intensifier, and \"infectious\" is definitely a risk-adjective, just like \"contagious.\" Bingo! That ticks the box for `intensifier + risk-adjective`.\n\nNow for \"deadly.\"  It's a risk-adjective, no question.  While \"deadly\" itself isn't directly modified, the phrase \"so infectious and deadly\" is structurally significant. The \"so\" intensifier clearly applies to both adjectives, essentially meaning \"so infectious and so deadly.\" And, I see from the decision tree example \"so deadly\", so I believe that I must treat them similarly here.\n\nBoth \"so infectious\" and \"so deadly\" fulfill the requirements of Q1.  With a \"yes\" answer to Q1, I stop and output the JSON with the rationale.  My decisive cues are \"so infectious\" and \"so deadly\"."}
