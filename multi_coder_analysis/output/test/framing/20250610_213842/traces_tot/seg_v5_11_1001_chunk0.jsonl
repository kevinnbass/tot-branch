{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Intensified Risk**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and need to determine if it fails the first question of our 12-step decision tree. This first question is straightforward: does the text contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective? Essentially, are they trying to amp up the danger factor?\n\nI scan the segment: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" I'm looking for those red flags – words like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"more,\" or \"deadlier\" directly preceding a term that describes the severity of a situation, like \"dangerous,\" \"deadly,\" or \"severe.\"\n\nLet's break it down: \"rare\" isn't a risk-adjective; it's a statement of frequency. Then we have \"but can occur,\" describing a possibility, not an intensified risk. \"After close contact\" and \"with an infected animal\" describe conditions, not amplifications of risk.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is a clear \"no.\" There's no evidence of an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective in this segment.  We can move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('is rare', 'can occur') and does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or the phrase 'on high alert'.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Evaluation: No High-Potency Cues Found**\n\nOkay, so I need to check this segment: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal\" against the criteria for Question 2 of the 12-step decision tree. Essentially, I'm looking for any linguistic red flags – those high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative/negative noun combos, or that \"on high alert\" phrase, especially when paired with a threat.\n\nLet's break it down: \"Human infection is rare but can occur...\" Hmm, the verb \"is\" and the modal \"can occur\" don't jump out at me as particularly forceful or alarming. They're pretty neutral. \"Ravaged,\" \"skyrocketed,\" those are the kind of verbs I'm *looking* for in this context, and those just aren't here.\n\nThere's no metaphor going on here that suggests an impending danger. It's just a straightforward statement about the possibility of infection. And no superlative followed by a negative noun, like \"worst case scenario,\" or anything like that. And finally, no \"on high alert\" flag.\n\nSo, overall, this segment doesn't contain any of the linguistic cues I'm looking for. It's a pretty factual, risk-neutral statement. My answer to Q2 is definitely \"no\". Onward to Q3, I suppose."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral verbs ('is', 'can occur') and does not pair them with explicit scale or impact information required for Q3.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against Decision Tree Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal,\" and my task is to determine if it aligns with Q3 of the decision tree. That means I need to see if it includes a 'moderate verb' combined with information about 'significant scale or impact.'\n\nLet's dissect this. \"Human infection is rare\" -- that's about frequency, not a moderate verb + impact. \"But can occur\" uses \"occur,\" which is neutral, and \"can\" indicates possibility – more like something Q8 or Q10 would be interested in.  Finally, \"after close contact...\" is all about the *how*, the conditions, of infection.\n\nI specifically looked for those 'moderate verbs' – *hit, swept, surged, soared, plunged, plummeted, prompted, feared, fearing, were/was culled* – but none are present. Similarly, there's no language that pairs any verb with details of significant scale or impact. It's just not there.\n\nTherefore, after careful review, my answer is a resounding \"no.\" The segment doesn't meet the criteria for Q3 because it lacks the required elements: a moderate verb coupled with information on significant scale or impact."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain a loaded rhetorical question.", "thoughts": "**Q4 Evaluation: No Loaded Rhetorical Question Detected**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this text fragment: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" My task is to determine if this piece triggers the \"loaded rhetorical question\" filter, specifically as per Q4 of the decision tree.  The instructions are clear - I need to just give a JSON response for Q4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a \"loaded rhetorical question.\" Q4 defines this, and I understand the concept. It's about questions designed to alarm or imply a specific answer.  I've looked at this text snippet, and the answer is immediately obvious. This is a simple, straightforward statement, not a question at all. There's no attempt to frame a question to evoke a particular emotional response or lead the audience to a pre-determined conclusion.\n\nThe fact that it's a declarative sentence automatically disqualifies it.  The rule clearly focuses on *questions*. My rationale is simple: the provided text does not contain any questions, let alone a loaded rhetorical one. So the answer to Q4 is \"no,\" which means I need to provide a JSON response with the rationale."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states human infection is 'rare', which is a low-risk fact, but it lacks explicit calming language or an intensified low-risk evaluation (e.g., 'very rare') required by Q5.", "thoughts": "**Evaluation of the Text Segment Against Q5**\n\nOkay, I've got it. The user wants me to assess the phrase \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal\" against Q5 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if this segment contains any explicit calming cues that communicate present safety, control, or significantly minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is that \"rare\" *suggests* low risk, which is a positive attribute. However, I immediately need to consider if \"rare\" is *intensified* in a way that aligns with Q5's requirements.  The examples and table in Q5 emphasize the need for qualifiers like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or \"exceptionally\" to explicitly mark low-risk statements as reassuring.  \"Rare\" on its own doesn't meet that bar; it's just a simple factual statement of likelihood.\n\nI then looked for any direct safety assurances, like \"completely safe\" or \"fully under control,\" which are explicitly listed as markers for reassuring language in the decision tree.  I also scanned for confidence statements like \"we are confident\" or preparedness cues directed toward public safety, but none of those patterns appear in the text.  It's just a straightforward report of a potential risk.\n\nWhen I compare it to the examples, this segment strongly resembles the \"Bare Positive Facts\" category and the \"Neutral (NOT Reassuring): 'The cases do not present an immediate public-health concern, the agency said.'\" example.  While \"rare\" isn't a negation, it functions similarly as a statement of low likelihood without explicit calming.  It's a low-risk fact, but it isn't framed with the necessary reassuring language to trigger Q5. No explicit calming cues were used.\n\nTherefore, my answer is \"no\". The segment, while mentioning a low likelihood, does not meet the Q5 criteria for explicit calming cues because it lacks the intensified low-risk framing (e.g., \"very rare,\" \"extremely rare\") or other direct safety assurance patterns required by the decision tree."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'rare' but lacks the specific 'minimiser + scale contrast' pattern required by Q6 (e.g., 'only X out of Y').", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Q6: Minimizer + Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, let's dive in. I'm being asked to assess this segment against Q6 of the decision tree, which specifically looks for \"Minimizer + Scale Contrast\" used for reassurance. The segment is: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"\n\nMy first step is to break it down. I need to identify both a minimizer *and* a scale contrast.\n\nFirstly, I see the word \"rare\". Is \"rare\" acting as a minimizer in the way Q6 intends? The rule clearly states it's looking for words like \"only\", \"just\", \"merely\", \"a single\", or \"few\", and that bare numerals aren't minimizers unless preceded by those specific words. \"Rare\" describes frequency, not quantity in the way that Q6 requires. It's more of a general descriptor of likelihood.\n\nSecondly, where's the scale contrast? I see \"Human infection\" and \"close contact with an infected animal\", but there's no \"X out of Y\" or \"among Z\" here. It doesn't present an explicit scale to contrast against.\n\nTherefore, although \"rare\" suggests low frequency, it's not the specific lexical minimizer pattern Q6 is designed to identify. It's simply describing the likelihood. The segment fails to meet the criteria because it lacks the required \"minimizer + scale contrast\" pattern. So, the answer to Q6 is a definite \"no.\" The rationale is that the segment doesn't contain the specific pattern we are looking for: it mentions a frequency in relation to a risk, but it does not employ the specified minimizers and scale contrasts."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states 'Human infection is rare', which describes frequency but is not one of the specific 'bare negation' patterns listed in Q7 (e.g., 'not expected', 'unlikely', 'no evidence', 'doesn't pose', 'will not', capability negations).", "thoughts": "**Analysis of \"Human infection is rare\" in Relation to Q7**\n\nAs an expert, my initial focus is on whether the phrase \"Human infection is rare\" constitutes a \"bare negation\" according to the very specific criteria of Q7. I meticulously reviewed the question's definition and the illustrative examples provided in the pattern table. My thought process moved through these steps:\n\n1.  **Understanding Q7:** The core of Q7 is to flag *explicit* negative or low-probability statements that aren't counterbalanced by calming language. The question highlights specific phrases like \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" and explicit negations like \"no\" or \"not.\" I needed to determine if \"rare\" fits this profile.\n\n2.  **Deconstructing \"Rare\":** While \"rare\" implies a low probability, it's not a direct negation like the examples in Q7. It's a descriptive adjective expressing infrequency. This is a subtle but important distinction.\n\n3.  **Comparing to Q7 Examples:** The Q7 examples are highly specific, including phrases like \"not expected to cause,\" \"unlikely to affect,\" and explicit negations such as \"no human cases\" or \"tests were negative.\" \"Rare\" isn't explicitly listed in these examples.\n\n4.  **Assessing the \"But\":** The structure of the segment, with the inclusion of \"but can occur,\" introduces a potential risk that counteracts any calming implication of \"rare.\" However, Q7 focuses specifically on the *bare* negation or low-probability statement itself, without calming cues.\n\n5.  **Re-evaluating \"Rare\":** I considered whether \"rare\" could be interpreted as a semantic equivalent of \"unlikely,\" but the rules emphasize the precise linguistic choices and specific patterns outlined in Q7. The emphasis is on explicit, predefined phrases.\n\n6.  **Reviewing Q8:** I checked that Q8, concerning capability statements, wasn't relevant to \"Human infection is rare.\"\n\n7.  **Consulting Q5/Q6:** I confirmed there was no explicit calming language in the segment, moving the analysis back to Q7.\n\n8.  **Re-reading Q7:** I scrutinized Q7's definition and examples again. The examples focus on very concrete phrasings that don't capture the nuanced meaning of \"rare.\" The regex patterns are also specifically crafted and don't include \"rare.\"\n\n9.  **The Bedrock Principle:** Given the detailed patterns and examples provided in Q7, I had to code the *presentation,* not the facts. I had to focus on *how* the low probability is expressed, and whether that fits Q7's *explicit linguistic patterns*.\n\n10. **The Final Judgement:** After extensive analysis, I'm confident that \"Human infection is rare\" doesn't strictly match the specific patterns and examples given in Q7. While \"rare\" implies low probability, it isn't an explicit negation or low-probability statement *as defined* by Q7. It does not perfectly fit the specific linguistic structures outlined in the question.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q7 is \"no.\" This leads me to proceed to the next question, Q8."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a fact about infection rarity and transmission conditions; it does not describe capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Q8**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" and asked to evaluate it against question Q8.  Q8, as I understand it, is looking for text that describes capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards *without* necessarily framing them in terms of current calm, safety, or risk minimization.\n\nLooking at the segment, I see a straightforward statement of fact. It tells me that human infection is unusual, but that it's a possibility given certain circumstances (close contact with an infected animal).  Crucially, though, it doesn't mention any capabilities that *prevent* infection, any measures taken to *prepare* for potential infection, any *hopeful* outcomes regarding infection rates, or any *safeguards* that are in place to mitigate the risk. It simply states a known biological reality.\n\nTherefore, because the segment fails to address any of the themes outlined in Q8, the answer to Q8 must be \"no.\" The rationale is clear: the segment doesn't discuss capabilities, preparedness, hopeful scenarios, or safeguards; it simply provides information about the likelihood of infection."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is not reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics as required by Q9.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Question Q9**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" My task is to determine if this aligns with the criteria outlined in Question Q9 of the decision tree. Q9, as I understand it, looks for text *primarily* reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics, using neutral verbs and adverbs, avoiding any inflammatory or overtly subjective language.\n\nLooking at the segment, it's immediately clear this isn't about economic indicators or price fluctuations. The subject is human infection and the transmission of disease. There are no numbers, financial figures, or economic concepts present. This is a statement of fact, maybe, in the field of public health, but it doesn't even touch on the types of data Q9 targets.\n\nTherefore, given my understanding of Q9, my answer is a definitive \"no.\" The segment doesn't report prices, economic data, or numerical metrics, and consequently, it doesn't align with the question's criteria. The rationale I'll provide will emphasize that the text is focused on a completely different domain: disease transmission."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the current state ('rare') and conditions for occurrence ('can occur'), but does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Decision Tree Q10**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" The task is to determine if this aligns with Q10 of the decision tree. Q10's focus is on whether the text speculates about future relief or improvement *without* a calming cue regarding the *current* state.\n\nLet's dissect this. \"Human infection is rare\" – that's a straightforward statement about the *present* condition. It's a fact, statistically speaking, about the *current* state of affairs. Then, \"but can occur after close contact with an infected animal\" – this is also a factual statement, describing *under what conditions* infection is possible.\n\nNow, does this segment venture into speculation about things getting better or improving in the future? Absolutely not. It doesn't mention resolution, easing, or any form of future improvement. It's purely describing the existing state (\"rare\") and a potential future state *if* certain conditions are met.\n\nTherefore, this segment definitively does *not* satisfy the criteria outlined in Q10. My answer has to be \"no\". It fails because it doesn't speculate about future relief; it simply describes the current situation and the potential for a change, not an improvement or relief."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any direct quotations or attributed statements.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with examining this text snippet to see if it triggers Q11 of my decision tree. That means I'm looking for a *dominant framed quotation* – specifically, a direct quote that uses either alarmist or reassuring language as defined in the rules I'm operating under.\n\nThe text in question is: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"\n\nAlright, first thing's first: are there any quotation marks? Nope. No quotation marks, so this isn't a direct quote. Just a plain, factual statement. I'm already leaning towards \"no\" at this stage.\n\nNow, let's look at the language itself. We have \"rare\" and \"can occur.\" Hmm, those terms are pretty objective, aren't they? \"Rare\" is just a descriptive term about frequency, and \"can occur\" simply acknowledges possibility. They're not explicitly trying to scare someone or make them feel better about a situation. I'm not seeing any of the alarmist or reassuring keywords or phrases that I'm supposed to be looking for.\n\nTherefore, because this is not a quoted section of text, I confidently determine the answer to Q11 to be \"no.\" No further framing is needed. Time to output the JSON and move on."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports a low-frequency fact ('rare') and a condition factually, without explicit alarmist or reassuring framing language.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Q12**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and the task is to run it through the Q12 check of our decision tree.  My understanding of Q12 is crucial here: it's the default-to-neutral step.  Essentially, if after analyzing the segment against all the previous questions (Q1-Q11), we find *no* explicitly Alarmist or Reassuring framing, and the facts are presented neutrally, the frame is Neutral.  Got it.\n\nLet's break down the given text: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"  My analysis focuses on identifying any Alarmist or Reassuring cues, as defined in our decision tree, remembering the SYMMETRY RULE, that Reassuring framing requires *explicit* framing for calm or safety.\n\nFirst, I look for **Alarmist cues**.  Are there intensifiers, vivid verbs, scale exaggeration, or loaded metaphors that amplify a negative fact?  \"Rare\" is a low-risk descriptor but doesn't *intensify* a negative. \"Can occur\" is a modal verb, simply stating possibility.  \"Close contact\" and \"infected animal\" are factual descriptions.  Nothing immediately jumps out as alarmist.\n\nNext, I check for **Reassuring cues**. Are there explicit phrases designed to convey calm or safety? I see \"rare,\" which implies low risk, but it's presented as a factual description of frequency, not explicitly *framed* for reassurance (like \"extremely low risk\" or \"don't worry\"). The SYMMETRY RULE is key here: Reassuring framing requires a *deliberate* effort to instill calm. \"Rare\" alone doesn't meet that threshold. No other calming cues are present.\n\nFinally, I consider if the segment fits any of the **Neutral** patterns.  \"Human infection is rare\" *factually* reports a low-frequency fact. \"Can occur after close contact\" *factually* describes a condition for occurrence. The language is descriptive, objective, reporting frequency (\"rare\") and a condition (\"close contact\").\n\nSince I find *no* explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues, and the facts are presented factually, my conclusion is that the segment defaults to **Neutral** according to Q12.  Therefore, the answer to Q12 is \"yes.\" This is because it objectively reports a low-frequency fact and its mechanism of occurrence, without any explicitly alarmist or reassuring framing. The segment doesn't amplify negativity or try to ease concerns beyond the simple presentation of facts."}
