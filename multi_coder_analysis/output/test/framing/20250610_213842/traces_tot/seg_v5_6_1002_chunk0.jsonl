{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'highly pathogenic avian flu' is treated as a technical term for the disease strain (H5N1) and is excluded from Q1 evaluation by the technical-term guard rule.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: No Alarmist Framing Detected**\n\nOkay, here's my assessment based on the provided text segment and the Q1 criteria of the 12-step decision tree. My goal is to determine if an intensifier or comparative adjective is directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nThe segment states: \"The broiler chickens... were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu...\"\n\nI immediately scan for the `(intensifier/comparative) + (risk-adjective)` pattern. I spot \"highly pathogenic avian flu.\" \"Highly\" is an intensifier, and \"pathogenic\" relates to disease, but...\n\nThe crucial detail here is the *technical-term guard*. The rules explicitly state to *ignore* the \"highly pathogenic\" phrase when it's part of the standard disease name, as is the case here (\"H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu\"). This phrase functions as a technical descriptor and is not being used to *alarm* the audience.\n\nWhile \"pathogenic\" itself *could* be considered a risk-adjective, its usage within this established scientific term nullifies the Q1 trigger. It's a technical term, not an intensifier-modified risk indicator for alarmist framing. Thus, my response to Q1 is \"no.\" This determination is based on the explicit exception for technical terminology within the decision tree's rules."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses factual language ('were infected', 'highly pathogenic avian flu') without high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 framing cues.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Against Q2 Criteria**\n\nOkay, I'm looking at this text segment and applying the Q2 filter from the decision tree. The user wants to know if the text uses any alarmist language, specifically focusing on high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert.\"\n\nMy initial impression is that this is fairly straightforward reporting. Let's break it down: \"The broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\"\n\nI'm starting with the verbs. \"Were infected\" is descriptive, but it's not a high-impact verb that's trying to sensationalize the situation. It's a statement of fact. Then, we have the phrase \"highly pathogenic avian flu.\" While the word \"pathogenic\" implies harm, \"highly pathogenic\" is a specific technical term used in virology to classify this particular strain. It's not the same as using a more vivid term like \"deadly\" or \"devastating.\" The rules state that Alarmist fires when a negative fact is *explicitly amplified*. This term is a technical classification, not an amplification cue.\n\nThere are no metaphors, and no superlatives paired with negative nouns, and crucially, no \"on high alert\" flag.\n\nEssentially, what we have is a straightforward news report stating a factual negative event: chickens have the flu. The technical language is used to describe the virus, but it's presented without embellishment.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I have to conclude that this segment does *not* contain any of the alarmist cues that Q2 is looking for. My answer is \"no,\" and I should proceed to the next stage of the analysis."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'were infected' is a plain outcome verb, not on the Q3 list of moderate verbs, and is not paired with significant scale/impact information.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Decision Tree Evaluation**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The task is to evaluate this text snippet against Q3 of the decision tree. Q3 is looking for a specific combination: a \"moderate verb\" *and* information indicating \"significant scale or impact.\" Let's break this down:\n\nFirst, I need to identify the text segment: \"The broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\" Got it.\n\nNext, I have to scan for those \"moderate verbs.\"  I'm using the approved list and regex, and I immediately see that \"were infected\" is the verb here. But wait... isn't that a problem? Looking at my notes, \"infected\" falls into that category of plain outcome verbs. These are explicitly *excluded* from the list of approved moderate verbs. We're looking for verbs like `hit`, `swept`, or something that implies a more forceful impact. \"Infected\" is more of a factual statement.\n\nEven if I *did* consider \"infected\" (which I can't), I have to check for that crucial \"significant scale or impact.\" The text mentions locations (Fulton County, Indiana) and types of birds (broiler chickens, turkeys). While this provides context, it doesn't give me any concrete figures or comparative terms. I'm not seeing numbers (millions, thousands), percentages, or phrases like \"devastating losses\" that would satisfy that \"significant scale\" requirement.\n\nTherefore, since the text fails on both fronts (no qualifying verb, no significant scale information), I can confidently say that Q3 is *not* satisfied. The answer is a clear \"no.\" My rationale will need to clearly articulate this, referencing the lack of a suitable moderate verb and the absence of any quantifiable scale or impact. The output will be a straightforward \"no,\" with an explanation."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Q4 Evaluation: No Loaded Rhetorical Questions Detected**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with assessing this text snippet against Question 4 of the decision tree. Q4's the one that flags potentially alarming rhetoric through the use of loaded questions. The text in question is: \"The broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\"\n\nMy initial read is that this is a straightforward factual statement. I'm looking for a question here, ideally a rhetorical one, that subtly nudges the reader toward a specific interpretation or reaction. But... there isn't one. The text is simply reporting the presence of H5N1 in chickens, comparing it to an existing outbreak in turkeys. No questions are present.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q4 is clearly \"no.\" There's no loaded rhetorical question to be found. And that means I'm supposed to move on to the next hop in the process. However, the instructions were specific. I'm to provide the JSON output for Q4, and Q4 alone."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (infection) and its source but contains no explicit language from the author or source designed to calm concerns or reassure the public about safety or control.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Against Q5**\n\nOkay, I've been given this text segment: \"The broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\"  I need to assess whether this contains any explicit calming cues, as defined by Q5. That means looking for language that specifically reassures the reader about safety, control, or significantly minimized risk.\n\nMy initial impression is that this is simply a factual report. It states that chickens in a specific location have been infected with a particular strain of avian flu. It also cites the source of this information. However, I'm not seeing any phrases that would fall under the category of \"explicit calming cues.\"  There's no mention of the situation being \"under control,\" \"no cause for alarm,\" or the risk being \"low.\"  It's just a statement of fact.\n\nThis is a straightforward report of a negative event, without any attempt to frame it in a way that would lessen anxiety or provide reassurance about public safety. Therefore, according to my understanding of Q5, the answer here is \"no.\" This text does not contain any explicit calming cues."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the infection factually and does not contain a minimiser (e.g., 'only', 'just') combined with a scale contrast (e.g., 'out of thousands') to downplay the event for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to assess this text segment against Q6 of that decision tree. Let's see... the question is whether it uses \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" to provide reassurance.\n\nFirst, I need to *really* look at the segment: \"The broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\"\n\nAlright, step one: identify any minimisers. I'm looking for words like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" that kind of thing. Nope, nothing there. No \"only a few chickens,\" or anything similar.\n\nNext, I need to see if there's a scale contrast being used. Something along the lines of 'out of thousands,' or 'nationwide,' to put the scope into perspective.  I see \"Fulton County,\" \"Tennessee,\" and \"Indiana\" mentioned.  These are locations, but they're not functioning as scale contrasts. There's nothing about 'a small subset out of a larger population' here.\n\nNow, let me check for a combination. Is a minimiser *and* a scale contrast being used together to try and downplay the significance?  The answer is still no. No minimisers, no scale contrasts in the right pattern.\n\nSo, for Q6... the answer is pretty straightforward: **no**.\n\nThe rationale is clear. The text segment simply reports the facts of the infection. It doesn't employ minimisers or scale contrasts to mitigate the impact or reassure the reader. The segment objectively states the facts, without the strategic use of those elements."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a fact about infection ('were infected') and does not contain any bare negation or language denying a risk.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text and my task is to determine if it fails the Q7 test in this decision tree. Q7, as I understand it, is all about spotting \"bare negations\" - those instances where the text denies or downplays a risk without providing some form of calming context.\n\nSpecifically, I'm hunting for words like \"not,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no evidence,\" etc., anything that negates or diminishes a potential problem without a corresponding assurance or mitigation.\n\nNow, let's break down the segment: \"The broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\"\n\nRight away, I see that this sentence is purely factual. It's simply stating that these chickens *were* infected. It's not saying they *weren't* infected, or that infection is *unlikely*, or that there's *no evidence* of infection, or anything of that nature. There's no negation present, nothing that downplays the severity of the situation. It’s a plain statement of fact.\n\nSince there's no bare negation, my answer to Q7 has to be \"no\".  That means, based on the decision tree, I move on to the next question. My JSON output needs to reflect this \"no\" answer, along with the reasoning I just laid out: the segment does not contain any form of negation."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes an infection factually and does not contain language related to capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against Question 8**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"The broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\" And my task? To assess this against Q8 of the decision tree. Q8 is looking for descriptions of capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards...but critically, it needs to lack explicit connections to current calm, safety, or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is to break down the text, looking for those key indicators. Does this segment talk about *what we can do*? Nope. Does it discuss *plans* or *readiness*? Not at all. Any mention of *future potential*? No. How about *protective measures* that have been put in place? Nada. It's a simple, factual statement – an infection *is* occurring. No context is given of what actions are taken.\n\nGiven the criteria of Q8, this text misses the mark. It's a straightforward reporting of an event, devoid of any language suggesting capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or implemented safeguards, without linking them to reassurance.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q8 is definitively \"no\". Since this is the case, I need to move to the next question in the decision tree (Q9, though I don't see that). In my output, I will reflect this \"no\" answer, and I'll include a rationale that explains precisely why this segment doesn't align with Q8's criteria. Basically, the fact that an infection has been reported doesn't immediately suggest what the focus of Q8 is trying to find.\n\nBased on my understanding of how this tool functions, I *suspect* this segment will ultimately be classified as \"Neutral,\" perhaps by a later rule, but my immediate focus is solely on Q8. My job is to answer the question at hand. This segment doesn't contain the features Q8 is searching for, so it's a \"no.\" My output will state that, along with an explanation: this doesn't fit the criteria of the question."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports on avian flu infection, not prices, economic data, or numerical metrics.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Decision Tree Q9**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and the task at hand is to assess it against Decision Tree Q9. My understanding of Q9 is that it's all about identifying text that's primarily reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics. Think standard economic verbs and maybe neutral adverbs, nothing too flashy, definitely *no* vivid language or risk adjectives, and no explicit framing.\n\nReading through the segment: \"The broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\" I immediately see that this is a report about avian flu outbreaks in poultry. It's got the location, the animals affected, the specific strain, and the source of the information.\n\nNowhere in this segment am I seeing anything that resembles prices, costs, revenue, or any other economic data. It's focused on the biological event of infection and the characteristics of the flu strain. This is a clear case of a scientific/medical report, not an economic one.\n\nTherefore, Q9 is not applicable here. The answer is a definitive \"no,\" because the text segment simply doesn't contain the type of economic data Q9 is designed to identify. It's a completely different subject matter."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a past/current event (chickens were infected) and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Q10**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with evaluating this text segment against Q10 of the decision tree. Q10 is looking for speculation about future relief or improvement *without* an explicit calming cue about the current state.\n\nFirst, I need to read the segment carefully: \"The broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\"\n\nMy initial thought is that this sounds like a straightforward report of a current or past event – the chickens *were* infected. I'm looking for language that suggests things *might* get better, like \"may be short-lived,\" \"could ease soon,\" or \"might improve.\"  I don't see any of that.\n\nIt's just a factual statement about the spread of avian flu. It lacks any future-oriented speculation about improvement. I even double-checked the examples for Q10 to be sure, and this doesn't match any of them.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q10 is unequivocally \"no.\" The segment doesn't meet the criteria. The rationale will be concise: \"The segment reports a past/current event (chickens were infected) and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.\"  That should be less than 80 tokens and accurately reflects my reasoning.\n\nI've confirmed the JSON format is correct, and I'm ready to move on, though I'm only asked to answer Q10. The analysis aligns with the principles of the decision tree."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment attributes information to officials but does not contain a direct quote with explicit framing language.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment: Not a Dominant Framed Quotation**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this text snippet based on question Q11, which is about dominant framed quotations. Let me break down my thought process:\n\nFirst, I looked at the segment itself: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the H5N1 strain, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\" My immediate goal was to zero in on any potential quoted material.  It's clear here that the information is *attributed* to \"Kentucky officials told Reuters.\"\n\nNext, I asked myself, is this a direct quote?  No. It's a paraphrase, a report, but not a direct word-for-word quote set off with quotation marks.\n\nThen, I focused on the *frame*. Did the attribution contain explicit framing language – either overly alarming or reassuring – to sway the reader?  No. The statement is factual. It relays that broiler chickens have the same H5N1 strain as turkeys. The language is objective: \"were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu\". No alarm bells, no calming tones.\n\nConsidering Q11's criteria, it's clear the answer is \"no.\" Q11 requires a *direct* quotation containing a *clear* and *dominant* Alarmist or Reassuring frame.  Since there's no direct quote, it can't meet the requirements of Q11. Therefore, \"no\" is the accurate response, and my rationale will highlight the absence of a quoted source with framed language."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Factual report of infection with technical classification; lacks explicit alarmist or reassuring framing cues.", "thoughts": "**Evaluation of Text Segment for Neutral Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"The broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\" My task is to determine if this falls under \"Neutral\" framing according to the 12-step decision tree. I must exhaustively examine it for alarmist or reassuring cues before concluding neutrality.\n\nFirst, I need to rule out alarmist cues from Q1-Q3.  There are no intensifiers paired with risk adjectives, vivid verbs describing impact, or moderate verbs with exaggerated scales. The phrase \"highly pathogenic avian flu\" is present, but this is a technical descriptor of the virus, not an amplification of its *impact* in an alarmist way. The context guard is key here. Next, I check for reassuring language from Q4; nothing there.\n\nSince no alarmist or reassuring cues appear, I then proceed to the remaining \"Neutral\" cues (Q5-Q11), which are not applicable.  This brings me to Q12, the final check. This segment reports a factual event: chickens infected with a specific flu strain, as reported by officials. The language (\"infected with,\" \"same strain,\" \"officials told\") is factual and descriptive. \"Highly pathogenic\" is part of the virus's official classification, not an added alarmist framing.\n\nTherefore, applying the Q12 definition, I conclude this is **Neutral** framing. The rationale: **Factual report of infection with technical classification; lacks explicit alarmist or reassuring framing cues.**"}
