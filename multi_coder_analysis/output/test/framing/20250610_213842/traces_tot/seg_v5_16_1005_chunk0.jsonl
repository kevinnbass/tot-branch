{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the fixed idiom 'deadly from the start'.", "thoughts": "**Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The task is to analyze the provided text against the first question of the decision tree. I see the target phrase, \"The H5N1 now spreading from wild birds is already highly pathogenic, which means it is deadly from the start, said Dr. Yuko Sato...\" My immediate thought is to check for the patterns specified in Q1: intensifiers/comparatives modifying risk adjectives, or the \"deadly from the start\" idiom. I've noted \"highly pathogenic\", but the rules regarding this phrase and \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\" warrant careful attention. However, \"deadly from the start\" jumps out. That's a fixed idiom. The table and the regex both flag this as an Alarmist cue. Therefore, since the segment contains the phrase \"deadly from the start,\" the answer to Q1 is definitively \"yes.\" My justification for that response is very simple: **The segment contains the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start.\"** That's enough to trigger the \"Alarmist\" label."}
