{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: No Intensifier/Comparative Adjective**\n\nOkay, so the task is to run the provided text, \"Birds from the infected flock will be culled and will not enter the food system, state officials said,\" through Q1 of the 12-step decision tree. I know Q1 is the initial screening for intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly modifying a risk-adjective. Essentially, it's the first filter for assessing the potential severity framing.\n\nLet's break this down. First, I need to identify the components: \"Birds from the infected flock\" is the subject and situation. \"Will be culled\" is an action. \"Will not enter the food system\" is a related outcome. And \"state officials said\" is a simple attribution.\n\nNow, let's examine for the key pattern. Does it contain an intensifier like \"so,\" \"very,\" \"extremely,\" etc., *or* a comparative adjective like \"more,\" \"deadlier,\" etc., *directly* modifying a risk-adjective? Risk-adjectives, as I know, include things like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" or \"catastrophic.\" They're words that inherently describe risk.\n\nIn this segment, \"infected\" is present. However, \"infected\" doesn't inherently represent a risk. It merely describes a state of being. The verb \"culled\" describes an action, and the statement about the food system is simply a consequence. No part of this sentence is directly amplifying the risk.\n\nTherefore, given the absence of any qualifying intensifiers or comparative adjectives modifying any risk-adjectives, the answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" The segment doesn't meet the specified pattern. I'll construct the JSON response now."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other patterns listed in Q2 that actively frame the situation alarmingly. 'Culled' describes an action, not the event's impact.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: Initial Assessment**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this text segment against the Q2 criteria. My initial thought is to quickly scan for those red-flag patterns: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative noun combos, and that \"on high alert\" phrase. The text is: \"Birds from the infected flock will be culled and will not enter the food system, state officials said.\"\n\nRight away, I see \"culled.\" It's definitely a verb describing a response. Now, the real question is whether \"culled\" functions as a high-potency verb here, framing the situation in an alarming way. When I think about it, in the context of disease outbreaks, the term \"culled\" has a technical sense. It’s about population control, a necessary measure. The provided examples of high-potency verbs paint a picture of devastating impact. My internal sense is that 'culled' is more of a factual description, a consequence of the outbreak, not a dramatic framing of its *severity*. It doesn't quite resonate with the language of something being \"ravaged\" or \"crippling\".\n\nThere are no potent metaphors, superlative-negative pairings, or the \"on high alert\" phrase. Those are all clear \"no's\".\n\nTherefore, after going through the analysis, my conclusion is clear: This segment does not trigger any of the Q2 alarm bells. It's a straightforward statement of a containment measure, not an attempt to paint the situation alarmingly. So, the answer to Q2 is \"no\". Now, I must proceed to Q3."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'will be culled' is a future passive form indicating a plan, not a realised impact, and is not paired with specific scale information.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment Against Q3**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with checking this text against Q3, which means I need to see if it describes a moderate verb coupled with significant scale or impact. Let's see... the segment is \"Birds from the infected flock will be culled and will not enter the food system, state officials said.\"\n\nMy first step, as always, is to identify the relevant parts.  The verb here is \"culled.\" Now, I need to check if that triggers Q3. According to my established processes, I need to be *very* precise here.  I know that \"culled\" is a moderate verb in some contexts, but I need to check against the specific rules. Looking at the regex and the tables, I see that the past tense form \"were/was culled\" *is* included, but the **future passive form \"will be culled\" is explicitly excluded.**  That's key. The tables are clear on this: future or planned actions get routed elsewhere, usually to Q8 or Q10.\n\nFurthermore, Q3 isn't just about the verb; it's also about significant scale or impact. I'm not seeing any quantifiable information here like \"thousands\" or \"millions of birds.\"  The statement is about a plan, not a realized impact.\n\nTherefore, because \"will be culled\" is a future passive form and there's no accompanying scale information, this segment *does not* meet the criteria for Q3. My answer is \"no.\"  The system should reflect that the future tense of the verb form makes this ineligible."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain a question, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm evaluating this text snippet against Q4 of my decision tree. The goal is to determine if the segment includes any loaded rhetorical questions designed to spark alarm. Specifically, I'm analyzing: \"Birds from the infected flock will be culled and will not enter the food system, state officials said.\"\n\nMy initial assessment is that this is a straightforward statement of fact. There's no hint of a question, let alone a rhetorical one intended to elicit fear or alarm. It's a declarative sentence, simply reporting that officials have stated these specific actions will be taken. No questions asked.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q4 has to be \"no\". My reasoning is straightforward: the segment doesn't contain a question. It's a statement of policy or planned action, not an attempt to create a rhetorical effect through questioning. The focus is on providing information, not on manipulating the audience's emotional response."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statement reports a positive outcome ('will not enter the food system') but lacks explicit calming language or intensified low-risk evaluation required for a Reassuring frame under Q5.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment Against Q5**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with analyzing this segment: \"Birds from the infected flock will be culled and will not enter the food system, state officials said.\" against the Q5 criteria, which is specifically looking for explicit calming cues that reassure the public about safety, control, or minimized risk.\n\nLet's break this down from my perspective.  The first part, \"Birds from the infected flock will be culled,\" is simply a factual statement, albeit a necessary but negative one, about the response to the infection.  The second part, \"and will not enter the food system,\" is a positive outcome from a consumer safety viewpoint, but the question is, *how* is this being framed? Is it being framed in a way that provides explicit reassurance?  The attribution to \"state officials\" is noted because it's relevant for preparedness cues, but the *content* isn't about preparation.\n\nNow, let's look at the patterns associated with Q5: Direct Safety Assurances, Confidence Statements, Preparedness Calming Cue, Low-Risk Evaluation (+ Intensifier), and Positive Amplification. None of those patterns are directly present here. The phrase \"will not enter the food system\" is a positive factual statement, but it's not couched in language intended to calm.  It's simply stating a fact about prevention.  The SYMMETRY RULE, which is key here, states that bare positive facts are considered Neutral unless coupled with explicit calming language.\n\nThis statement doesn't use any calming language whatsoever.  We're looking for phrases like \"rest assured,\" \"completely safe,\" \"no danger,\" or intensified risk evaluations. This falls short of that.  Therefore, I'd have to say \"no\" to Q5.  The segment reports a positive outcome, but it doesn't do so with the *explicit* reassuring language that Q5 is looking for. It's a factual statement, not a calming one."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser (e.g., 'only', 'just') combined with a scale contrast (e.g., 'out of thousands').", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" Pattern**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with examining this sentence: \"Birds from the infected flock will be culled and will not enter the food system, state officials said.\" against Q6, which is all about spotting the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern specifically for Reassurance. My understanding of Q6 is that it wants me to identify instances where the text is using minimizing language (like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few\") *in conjunction with* some sort of scale contrast (e.g., \"out of thousands,\" \"among millions,\" \"nationwide\"). It's a key strategy to identify when reassuring.\n\nLet's break down the sentence: we've got a description of the birds from the infected flock being culled and not entering the food system, along with the source of the information, the state officials. Now, I have to pinpoint if this phrase contains a minimizer and if the group, as written, has implied contrast.\n\nI'm scanning for those specific minimizers: \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few\". They aren't there. The phrase doesn't contain a word that suggests that the culling affects a small portion relative to a larger group. It simply states that those *infected* birds will be removed. We're not told if this is a small flock, or a very large one relative to all of the birds in the country or state. There's no \"only a few birds out of a million\" or similar.\n\nTherefore, since the sentence doesn't use the required minimizer words and scale contrast I am confident my answer to Q6 is no."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'will not enter the food system' is a bare negation without an explicit calming cue.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Q7**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment: \"Birds from the infected flock will be culled and will not enter the food system, state officials said.\" My task is to apply Q7 of the decision tree to it. Q7 specifically asks about 'bare negations' lacking calming cues.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the negation. Clearly, it's \"will not enter.\"  This refers to a potential risk: birds entering the food supply. The key now is whether this negation is *bare* – meaning, is there an explicit calming cue *immediately following* it?\n\nThe rules and examples for Q7 are really clear on this point. \"Will not impact food supply\" and \"birds will not enter the food system\" are both explicitly labeled as examples of bare negations that are Neutral *unless* a calming phrase follows.\n\nLooking at the segment, there's *nothing* after \"will not enter the food system\" that offers reassurance. There's no \"so consumers can rest easy,\" no \"meaning there's no risk,\" nothing to mitigate the negative.\n\nTherefore, this fits the definition of a bare negation without a calming cue. My answer to Q7 will be \"yes,\" and I can justify this based on the presence of the bare negation \"will not enter the food system.\" According to the established logic, this results in a Neutral frame."}
