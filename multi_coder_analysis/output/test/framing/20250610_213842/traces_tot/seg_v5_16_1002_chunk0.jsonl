{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: No Intensifiers or Comparatives**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\" My goal is to determine if it meets the criteria of Q1 in the 12-step decision tree. Essentially, I'm hunting for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nI'm scanning the text, looking for patterns like \"so deadly,\" \"very dangerous,\" or \"more severe.\" Let's break it down:\n\n*   \"first bird flu viruses\" - Nope, nothing there.\n*   \"emerged in southern China\" - Still nothing. Just factual information.\n*   \"leading to large outbreaks\" - Now, \"large outbreaks\" is interesting. \"Outbreaks\" is definitely negative, but \"large\" is a size indicator, not a risk-specific adjective like \"deadly\" or \"dangerous.\" This looks more like something for Q3 (Moderate Verb + Scale/Metric), if anything.\n*   \"late 1990s\" - Just a time reference.\n*   \"according to the CDC\" - Irrelevant for this specific question.\n*   \"virus variants spread throughout the world\" - \"Spread\" is a verb, and \"throughout the world\" is a scale or metric of how far it went. This might be relevant for Q2 (Vivid Verb) or Q3 (Scale/Metric), but again, not Q1.\n\nBasically, I'm not seeing any \"so dangerous\" or \"deadlier than ever\" phrasing. There are no intensifiers like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or comparatives like \"more\" directly modifying the kinds of words I'm looking for. This text doesn't explicitly highlight the risk level using those particular rhetorical tools. Therefore, my conclusion is that the answer to Q1 is \"no.\""}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses moderate verbs like 'emerged', 'leading', and 'spread', which are not considered high-potency verbs or potent metaphors under Q2 rules.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment: Q2 Evaluation**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to assess it based on the Q2 criteria of the 12-step decision tree. My goal is to see if it triggers any red flags regarding high-potency language.\n\nFirst, I scanned for any of those potent verbs, metaphors, superlative-negative noun combos, or the \"on high alert\" phrase. I immediately noted the verbs: \"emerged,\" \"leading,\" and \"spread\". \"Emerged\" seems fairly neutral in this context. \"Leading\" is a bit more active, but not on the high-potency list. Now, \"spread\" - that one's interesting because the table classifies it as a moderate verb. The rule is clear: *unless* paired with scale/impact details AND considered under Q3, it's neutral within the scope of Q2.\n\nI considered whether \"large outbreaks\" and \"throughout the world\" qualify it as high impact, but based on the rules within Q2 they do not.\n\nSo, according to Q2's strict criteria, I didn't see any high-potency verbs, impactful metaphors, or the other specific phrases we are looking for. It seems like the segment doesn't immediately warrant escalation based on Q2's checklist. So, my answer to Q2, based solely on those criteria, is a definite \"no.\" Now, on to Q3, as the rules dictate! However, I can only provide the answer to Q2."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses verbs like 'emerged', 'leading to', and 'spread', which are not on the Q3 list of moderate verbs that trigger this rule, despite mentioning scale ('large outbreaks', 'throughout the world').", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text and need to evaluate it against question Q3 in our decision tree for claim framing. Essentially, I'm checking if it uses \"moderate verbs\" alongside \"significant scale or impact\" information.\n\nFirst, I parsed the text: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"\n\nMy initial task was to isolate the verbs. I identified \"emerged\", \"leading to\", and \"spread.\"  Then, I compared these against the specific list of moderate verbs that trigger Q3: `hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|(?:were|was)\\s+culled`. None of the verbs in the text match this list.\n\nNext, I considered whether the segment presents \"significant scale or impact.\" It does mention \"large outbreaks\" and \"spread throughout the world,\" which certainly qualify. However, since those descriptions of scale/impact aren't directly linked to a verb from the Q3 list, the requirement isn't met.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to Q3 is \"no.\"  The text doesn't contain a moderate verb from the defined list in conjunction with scale/impact information.\n\nTherefore, my final output will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment does not contain a moderate verb from the specified list (hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|(?:were|was)\\s+culled) paired with significant scale or impact information, despite mentioning 'large outbreaks' and 'spread throughout the world'.\"\n}\n```"}

There are no questions at all, let alone rhetorical ones designed to provoke fear.\n\nTherefore, after a thorough review, the answer to Q4 is clearly \"no.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The text segment is a declarative statement and does not contain any questions, particularly loaded rhetorical ones designed to instill alarm.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text describes historical events (emergence, outbreaks, spread) and attributes the information to the CDC, but contains no explicit language or cues designed to calm concerns or assure current safety or control.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text snippet and need to determine if it uses any explicit calming language, specifically as defined by Question 5. The prompt wants me to check for those signals that reassure safety, control, or reduced risk. I'm familiar with these types of evaluations, so let's break it down.\n\nMy immediate focus is on the criteria for Q5: direct safety assurances, confidence statements, preparedness calming cues, low-risk evaluations, or positive amplification. I know to look for specific phrases or patterns.\n\nThe text describes the historical timeline of bird flu. It mentions the virus emerging in China, leading to large outbreaks, and then spreading globally.  I'm scanning for those specific reassurance phrases, or anything that sounds like a proactive effort to calm fears about the *current* risk.\n\nRight away, I don't see anything. \"Emerged in China,\" \"leading to outbreaks,\" \"spread throughout the world\" are factual descriptions of past events. The mention of the CDC is simply an attribution of the source. None of this directly translates to, \"Don't worry, everything is safe now.\" No assurances, no confidence statements, no positive spin. It's a straight-up historical account.\n\nI'm confident in my assessment. There's no language that even remotely signals that current risk is minimized or that control is established. The text is informative, but it's not trying to calm anxieties. Based on the Q5 criteria, the answer is a clear \"no.\""}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the emergence and spread of bird flu viruses, mentioning 'large outbreaks' and spreading 'throughout the world'. It does not contain a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) combined with a scale contrast to downplay the event.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Against Q6**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with checking this sentence against the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern, specifically to see if it's being used to offer reassurance, right? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I read the text: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"\n\nMy initial thought is to hunt for those classic minimisers – \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" that sort of thing.  I don't see any of them. \"First\" is descriptive, but not in the *minimising* way we're looking for.  It's just stating the initial emergence. The text describes \"large outbreaks,\" and then the \"spread throughout the world\". Now I need to see if those descriptions of scale are being used in a *contrasting* manner to minimise a specific detail or number, which would then be a signal of reassurance.\n\nThe phrase \"large outbreaks\" and the description of the spread \"throughout the world\" *do* indicate scale, but they're not presented in conjunction with a minimiser. It's just stating the scope of the virus's impact. The phrase \"throughout the world\" describes a broad geographic reach, but it doesn't do so *in contrast* to a minimised quantity or scope.\n\nSo, since the 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' pattern isn't present, the answer is \"no.\"  I'll format my findings as a JSON object, as requested."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes historical events (emergence, outbreaks, spread) and does not contain a bare negation of a current or future risk or problem.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment through the lens of Question 7 in our decision tree.  My mission is clear: does it contain a \"bare negation\" without any kind of calming cue?  I'm focusing specifically on phrases that flat-out deny or minimize a present or imminent risk.  Think \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no evidence,\" that sort of thing.\n\nScanning the text, I'm seeing historical reporting.  The segment starts by talking about the origin of bird flu viruses and then moves chronologically through outbreaks in the late 90s, and then the virus spreading.  I'm not picking up on any direct negations.  It's just detailing the past.  Phrases like \"believed to have emerged\" aren't negations, they're qualifications about a *past* event.  The descriptions of outbreaks and spread certainly don't sound reassuring, but they're not explicitly *denying* anything.\n\nSince I don't see any \"bare negations\" - no \"no concerns here\" or anything like that - the answer to Question 7 is definitely \"no.\" I'm clear to move on to the next question, which, luckily, is not required of me."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the historical emergence and spread of the virus, not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet about the historical spread of bird flu, and I need to determine if it aligns with Question 8 of this decision tree. Q8 is looking for language related to capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, *without* those concepts being explicitly connected to current calm, safety, or minimized risk.\n\nFirst, I parsed the text: \"The first bird flu viruses... emerged in southern China... leading to large outbreaks... before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\" It's essentially a historical timeline. I can see that the text attributes the information to the CDC.\n\nNow, I checked if it hits any of the Q8 criteria: capabilities, preparedness, hopeful futures, or safeguards.  Nope. No mention of vaccine development, systems in place, improved situations, or protocols. It's strictly about the virus's history, not human response.\n\nSince it doesn't describe those things at all, it can't describe them *without* active reassurance. The core premise of the question is not satisfied. The segment *doesn't* describe those elements.\n\nTherefore, according to the logic, I have to proceed to the next question.\n\nI quickly double-checked the pattern examples in the Q8 table, just to be sure. \"Vaccine can be made,\" \"officials are working,\" etc. My segment doesn't match those at all. It's about the virus's *actions*, not human efforts.\n\nSo, I'm confident in my \"no\" answer.  The text *doesn't* describe capabilities, preparedness, etc.  I need to move on to Q9, and my rationale will be clear: the segment's focus is historical, describing the virus's origin and spread, and does not touch on the human response elements that Q8 is evaluating. I will output \"answer\": \"no\" and a clear, concise rationale."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses the emergence and spread of bird flu viruses and outbreaks, not prices, economic data, or numerical metrics as defined by Q9.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Decision Tree Q9**\n\nAlright, I've got the text segment: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\" My task is to determine if this aligns with Q9 of the decision tree. From my understanding of the question, it's looking for reports of prices, economic data, or numerical metrics, focusing on neutral language, standard verbs, and lacking any strong framing.\n\nClearly, this segment is about the historical emergence and spread of avian influenza. It dives into the origins and outbreak timelines related to a virus. The focus isn't on any economic figures, pricing information, or quantifiable metrics related to financial data. There are no discussions of costs, revenues, market rates, or anything of that sort. The language is descriptive, but that description relates to the progress of the virus, rather than to any financial data.\n\nTherefore, this text absolutely does *not* fit the criteria for Q9. My answer, unequivocally, is \"no.\""}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes past events (emergence, outbreaks, spread) and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Q10 Evaluation: A Historical Perspective**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment and asked to assess it against Q10 of our decision tree.  Q10, as I recall, is all about whether the segment *speculates* about future relief or improvement *without* a calming cue about the present. Got it.\n\nLooking at the segment, I see it's about the origins and spread of bird flu: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"\n\nMy immediate thought is, this is all historical narrative. It's about past events: emergence, outbreaks, spread. I'm not seeing any language that points towards *future* conditions.  There's no speculation about when this will be resolved, what improvements might occur, or any potential relief from the situation.  It's just a chronological recounting.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q10 is a clear \"no\". The text doesn't speculate about future relief. Since I'm only asked for the answer to Q10, I'll provide the JSON with the appropriate answer and rationale."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment attributes information to the CDC but does not contain a direct quote or attributed statement with explicit alarmist or reassuring framing language.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Segment Against Q11**\n\nOkay, I'm being asked to apply my expertise to this text segment and see if it triggers Q11 of our decision tree. That means I need to hunt for a dominant framed quotation. My understanding is that Q11 is specifically looking for a direct quote or attributed statement using the \"Alarmist\" or \"Reassuring\" vocabulary as we've defined it.\n\nSo, let's break this down. The segment is: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the information *is* attributed: \"according to the CDC\". That's good. Now, I have to examine *what* is attributed. We have \"believed to have emerged,\" \"leading to large outbreaks,\" and \"spread throughout the world.\" These phrases describe events – the emergence, the outbreaks, the spread. While \"leading to large outbreaks\" *does* describe a negative event, and potentially implies a negative *impact*, it's crucial to apply my understanding of the framing rules. I'm looking for *explicit* Alarmist or Reassuring language, the kind that amplifies the impact using vivid language, like \"catastrophic,\" \"alarming,\" \"no cause for alarm,\" etc.\n\n\"Large outbreaks\" is a *description of scale*, not a framing device. I'd need to see some sort of intensifier or a clearly emotionally charged word to trigger \"Alarmist.\" There are no direct quotes present either, using quotation marks.\n\nGiven this analysis, my expert opinion is that the answer to Q11 is \"no\". There isn't a direct quote or attributed statement with the specific Alarmist or Reassuring language we're looking for. Therefore, I'll proceed to the next node in the tree."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment presents factual information about the origin and spread of bird flu outbreaks using neutral, descriptive language without explicit framing cues.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Bird Flu Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment about bird flu, specifically through the lens of that Q12 question in my decision tree for claim framing. Essentially, it boils down to: did I find any alarmist or reassuring cues in the previous steps (Q1-Q11)? If not, the default is \"Neutral.\"\n\nMy initial impression is that the text is pretty straightforward. It talks about the origins and spread of bird flu viruses. It mentions \"large outbreaks\" and that these virus variants are spreading \"throughout the world.\" I see these as negative facts, sure – outbreaks and spread are generally undesirable things. However, and this is crucial, it's how they're *presented* that matters.\n\nI'm carefully scanning for intensifiers, vivid verbs that amplify impact (\"exploded,\" \"soared\"), scale exaggeration, loaded metaphors, or any outright attempts to calm or reassure. I'm not seeing them. The language is descriptive and factual: \"believed to have emerged,\" \"leading to large outbreaks,\" \"spread throughout the world.\" It's not *framing* these events to induce alarm or offer false comfort.\n\nThe phrase \"large outbreaks\" is simply a factual statement about the scale. Same with \"spread throughout the world\" - it's a description of geographical reach, nothing more. It's not trying to paint a picture.\n\nThe SYMMETRY RULE and the Default-to-Neutral Rule both come into play here. Negative facts, presented neutrally, lean towards a Neutral frame. Since I haven't detected any specific framing cues in the earlier questions, Q12 applies. The default kicks in, and my assessment is: **Neutral.** The rationale? The facts are presented factually, without any overt alarmist or reassuring framing. It's simply a factual description of what's happening."}
