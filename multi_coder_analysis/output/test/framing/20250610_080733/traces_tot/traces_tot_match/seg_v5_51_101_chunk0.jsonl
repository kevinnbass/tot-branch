{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**Initial Assessment: Alarmist Cue Detection**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to apply Q1 from the decision tree.  My primary focus is to see if an intensifier or comparative adjective is directly modifying a risk adjective. This is how we begin to detect if the writing is alarmist, right? The goal is to see if the phrase fits the pattern.\n\nLet's dissect the text: \"The virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\"  I see \"so contagious\" immediately.  Now, I'm pretty familiar with the definitions, and \"so\" is definitely an intensifier. We're looking for that kind of word. And \"contagious,\" yep, that's absolutely a risk adjective â€“ describes the potential danger here.\n\nBingo!  The pattern, *intensifier + risk-adjective*, is present. \"So\" modifies \"contagious.\" This checks the box for Q1. Because Q1 is true, my analysis stops here. The frame dictated by Q1 is \"Alarmist.\" Now, it's a simple matter of providing the output the model expects. My JSON output should reflect \"yes\" as the answer, with a rationale highlighting the \"so contagious\" cue."}
