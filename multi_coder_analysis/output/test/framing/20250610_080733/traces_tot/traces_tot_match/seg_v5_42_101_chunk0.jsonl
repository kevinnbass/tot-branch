{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question about stopping spread and does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Question's Risk Profile**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" and I need to run it through this 12-step decision tree. Starting with Q1, it's pretty clear where we're headed. The question wants to know if the phrase uses any heightened language to amplify the risk, like an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk adjective, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\".\n\nLet's break it down. I'm looking for words that make the risk sound bigger, or comparative statements that highlight differences in risk. Scanning the phrase, I immediately see no intensifiers like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or any comparatives like \"more\" or \"less.\" There's also no obvious risk adjective present, at least not directly modified. The word \"spread\" itself speaks to the nature of a virus, and it's a critical concept, but it's not a risk adjective on its own. It’s also not the idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\".\n\nTherefore, after a quick analysis, my answer to Q1 is a definitive \"no\". The phrase is simply asking about actions to control the virus’s spread, not amplifying the description of the virus using amplified risk language. I can move on to the next step, knowing this segment doesn’t trigger the heightened risk indicators Q1 is looking for."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking about stopping the spread of a virus and contains no high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 framing language.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Framing of a Question**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the segment, \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" and I need to assess it against Q2 of the decision tree. My expertise tells me Q2 is looking for specific linguistic elements that signal an alarmist framing of the situation – essentially, are they trying to whip up fear or urgency?\n\nLet's break this down. Q2 is on the lookout for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert\". My initial read tells me none of those are immediately present. The segment poses a question, \"What can be done...\", which inherently suggests a problem, but doesn't *inherently* frame it as an urgent crisis.\n\nI see \"stop the spread of the virus.\" \"Stop\" is a decent, functional verb, but it's not a \"ravaged,\" \"skyrocketed,\" \"crippling\" type of verb. It simply describes an action – *stopping* the spread. It's not about the severity of the virus's effects, but about a countermeasure. Similarly, \"spread of the virus\" is a perfectly neutral description of a natural process. Nothing inherently alarming there.\n\nSo, in my professional opinion, this doesn't fit the criteria of Q2. There's no blatant fear-mongering language. Therefore, I'm confident my answer to Q2 is a resounding \"no.\" And my rationale is straightforward: the segment simply doesn't contain the specific framing language that Q2 is designed to identify. It's a question about *mitigation*, not a hyperbole about *disaster*."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and contains no moderate verbs or scale/impact details.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" and I need to evaluate it against question Q3 of the decision tree. My expert intuition immediately flags this as a potentially tricky one. I know Q3 is looking for two specific things: 'moderate verbs' from that predefined list and details about significant scale or impact.\n\nFirst, I quickly scan the text. No, there's nothing on the surface that screams \"moderate verb.\" I need to be precise here, so I re-check the list of moderate verbs – hit, swept, surged, soared, plunged, plummeted, prompted, feared, fearing, were/was culled – and I'm confident there's nothing that fits.\n\nNext, I need to look for any information about scale or impact. Again, I don't see anything explicitly quantifying the problem's magnitude: no \"millions culled,\" no \"record losses,\" no talk of \"overwhelming systems.\" It's just a general question about containment.\n\nThe rule requires *both* of those elements. Since neither is present, the answer to Q3 has to be \"no.\" The segment doesn't meet the criteria, plain and simple. Therefore, I'll formulate my JSON response accordingly, with a clear rationale explaining the lack of moderate verbs or impact data."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The question 'What can be done...' is a neutral, information-seeking question, not a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm or instill fear.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Question Regarding Virus Spread**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" and I need to assess if it triggers Q4, specifically whether it's a loaded rhetorical question implying alarm.\n\nFirst, I break it down. The segment itself is a straightforward question: \"What can be done...?\" Then I have Q4's guidelines in front of me - looking for alarmist rhetorical questions designed to induce fear or urgency. I pay close attention to the distinction Q4 makes between neutral, information-seeking questions and those that manipulate through loaded language.\n\nComparing the two, it's clear the segment isn't loaded. It's asking for information about solutions, mitigation strategies, or actions to take. It's not using language designed to scare people like a \"crisis\" or imply doom. I also check the Q4 pattern table; this clearly aligns with the \"Neutral Information-Seeking\" category. I even go back and make sure that it's consistent with provided examples like \"What are the safety protocols in place?\", which is also information-seeking and not loaded.\n\nSo, based on this evaluation, the answer is a clear \"no.\" It's a request for information, not a tool for alarmism."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking about actions to stop the spread of a virus. It contains no explicit calming cues or language communicating current safety or minimized risk.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q5**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this short text snippet, \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\", and determine if it hits the criteria of Question 5 in the decision tree. Q5 is specifically looking for explicit calming cues; language that assures safety, control, or significantly minimized risk in the *present* moment.\n\nMy task is to carefully dissect the phrase and see if it contains any of those patterns. I'm going through the Q5 pattern recognition table in my head, mentally ticking off the boxes. Does it offer any direct safety assurances like \"no cause for alarm\" or \"the public can rest easy?\" Nope. Is there any indication of preparedness, like \"we are fully prepared to handle this?\" Again, no. How about low-risk evaluations combined with intensifiers like \"*very* low risk?\" Not present. Are there any positive amplifications or any confidence statements? Nope, nothing there. Lastly, are there any bare positive facts that might signal safety? I'm not seeing any of those, either.\n\nHonestly, the segment is a straightforward question about action: what can be done to *stop* the spread. It doesn't even touch on current safety or reassurance. It is solely about potential actions to take in the future.\n\nTherefore, after a thorough review, the answer to Q5 is definitely \"no\". I'm going to structure my response as a JSON object, clearly stating \"no\" as the answer and providing a concise rationale for my conclusion."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment asks a question about stopping the spread and contains no minimiser or scale contrast cues.", "thoughts": "**Assessing for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" Pattern**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\". My task is clear: I need to determine if this aligns with the criteria set by Q6, specifically the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern within the Reassurance category.\n\nMy first step is to break down the phrase. I'm looking for two key elements. Firstly, a minimiser – something like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"a few.\" Secondly, a scale contrast, which could be something along the lines of \"out of millions\" or \"among thousands.\"\n\nUpon direct analysis of the segment \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\", I can readily see that neither element is present. There's no minimizer at play here, and certainly no scale contrast.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that this specific phrase does not meet the requirements of Q6. The final answer, naturally, is \"no,\" as the target linguistic pattern is simply not present. I'll need to remember this clear distinction for future analyses."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and does not contain any form of bare negation as defined by Q7.", "thoughts": "**Assessing for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" and I need to evaluate it in the context of question Q7. Q7, as I understand it, is looking for instances of \"bare negation\" – specifically, phrases that deny or minimize a risk without explicitly offering a calming counterpoint or cue.\n\nMy initial analysis reveals this is a question, not a declarative statement. I then focus on the core of Q7 and confirm that the phrase, while concerned with stopping something, is phrased in an interrogative. It does not contain any of the negative phrasing that Q7 specifically targets, like denying something will happen or claiming something is unlikely. I'm looking for direct negations of risk, and that isn't present here.\n\nTherefore, applying the Q7 criteria directly, the answer is unequivocally \"no.\" This phrase is simply not structured in a way that suggests a bare negation. The JSON response will accurately reflect this conclusion, clearly stating \"no\" with a rationale that explains the absence of the targeted patterns."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment asks about potential actions/capabilities ('What can be done') without linking them to current calm or safety.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" against Q8**\n\nOkay, so the task is to analyze this question within the framework of Q8. Q8, as I understand it, is looking for statements that describe capabilities, preparedness, or hopeful possibilities without explicitly connecting them to *current* states of safety or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial assessment is this is pretty straightforward. The segment, \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\", is a question.  It's immediately about *potential* actions – things we *could* do, measures we *might* implement. It's squarely in the realm of capabilities, preparedness, or looking forward to hopeful possibilities – specifically, the possibility of stopping the virus.\n\nNow, does it offer any active reassurance about the current situation? Does it say, \"Because of these things we're doing, we're safe *now*\" or \"The risk is *currently* minimized\"?  Absolutely not. It's simply posing a question *about* these actions, not stating that they're currently effective and providing reassurance.\n\nTherefore, this squarely fits the definition of a \"Capability/Preparedness Statement without Active Reassurance,\" the exact scenario described by Q8.  I will answer \"yes\" to Q8. My rationale will focus on the key phrase, \"What can be done,\" and highlight how it relates to potential actions without any direct connection to the *present* level of risk or safety.  I'm confident I can frame this accurately within the valid JSON format and that it will satisfy the self-audit requirements."}
