{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a factual procedure ('quarantined') and mentions 'HPAI', which is excluded by the technical-term guard for Q1.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Evaluation: A Clean Bill of Health**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\" My task is to see if it triggers Q1 of the decision tree, which boils down to whether there's an intensifier or comparative adjective directly beefing up a risk-adjective.\n\nRight off the bat, I see \"HPAI\" - and I *know* the rule explicitly exempts \"highly pathogenic\" when it's part of the official name. That's a huge clue right there. My initial thought is, \"this could be neutral.\"\n\nThen I scan for those telltale signs. I'm looking for \"so deadly,\" \"very dangerous,\" \"more severe,\" or even that \"deadly from the start\" phrase. Nope. Nothing. I also need to see an intensifier or comparative *modifying* a risk-adjective. I'm not seeing any real risk-adjectives in the first place! Quarantine is factual, it's not a risk adjective, so that's not the hook.\n\nNo intensifiers, no comparatives, no modified risk-adjectives, no alarms. It looks like Q1 is a firm \"no.\" I'm clear to move on to the next question, but I'll craft my rationale to explain what I did *not* find."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the factual term 'quarantined' which is not a high-potency verb, potent metaphor, superlative-negative noun, or critical alert phrase.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: A Straightforward \"No\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\" My task is to run it through the Q2 filter, which looks for specific alarm-raising language. Let's see...\n\nI'm mentally running through the checklist: potent verbs like \"ravaged\" or \"devastated\"? Nope. Superlative negative nouns like \"worst crisis\"? Doesn't apply here. The \"on high alert\" phrase? Absent. And no potent metaphors like \"ticking time-bomb\"? Not a chance.\n\nThe key verb here is \"quarantined.\" While significant, it's a technical term describing a regulatory action, not a hyperbolic descriptor designed to inflate the situation. It lacks the emotional charge of the high-potency verbs we're looking for.\n\nTherefore, after a quick and thorough check, my answer to Q2 is a definitive \"no.\" This segment doesn't contain any of the linguistic red flags we're looking for."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses factual verbs ('is found', 'are quarantined') and provides no information about scale or impact, failing the Q3 criteria.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Framing: Q3 Assessment**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. The user wants me to apply Question 3 of the 12-step decision tree to the following segment: \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\" My focus is on identifying any instances of \"moderate verbs\" paired with \"significant scale or impact\" information, the hallmarks of an Alarmist frame according to Q3.\n\nFirst, I need to check for those specific verbs from the Q3 regex list. I'm looking for things like \"hit,\" \"swept,\" \"surged,\" or \"feared\" – verbs that denote a realized impact, not just a plan or potential outcome.\n\nExamining the segment, the key verbs are \"is found\" and \"are quarantined.\"  \"Is found\" is purely factual, and \"are quarantined\" describes a containment action, not a devastating impact. Neither verb appears on the Q3 list.\n\nSecondly, I need to look for any details conveying significant scale or impact. I'm watching for clues like \"millions,\" \"record losses,\" or descriptions of overwhelmed systems.  There's no such information here.\n\nSince the segment contains neither the necessary verbs nor any indicators of scale or impact, the criteria for Q3 are not met. Therefore, the answer to Q3 is definitively \"no.\" I'm now ready to proceed with the output, which will reflect this negative assessment and briefly outline my rationale."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement describing a procedure, not a loaded rhetorical question.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, I've been asked to assess a text segment against Q4 of this decision tree, specifically looking for loaded rhetorical questions that might be used to incite alarm. The segment in question is \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\"\n\nMy expert eye immediately sees this is a straightforward declarative statement about USDA policy. It's not phrased as a question, doesn't utilize any questioning syntax, and certainly isn't designed to imply some alarmist scenario. Therefore, I can confidently answer \"no\" to Q4. The rationale is simple: the text segment is a statement of fact, not a question, let alone a loaded one.\n\nNow, I'll move on to the next question in the sequence, Q5, but for now, my part in answering Q4 is done."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a factual procedure (quarantine) but lacks explicit calming language or intensified low-risk evaluation.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA,\" and the goal is to see if it triggers any \"explicit calming cues\" related to safety, control, or minimized risk. This is the Q5 test.\n\nMy immediate thought is that it doesn't contain any of those classic reassurance phrases. I'm not seeing anything about \"no need to worry,\" \"everything's under control,\" or \"rest assured.\"  It's just a straightforward statement about what happens.\n\nI reviewed the patterns in the Q5 table and the regex, and while the segment describes an official action (quarantine by the USDA), it doesn't *frame* that action in a way that's meant to explicitly soothe concerns about present safety. Quarantine is a standard response, but the language doesn't amplify the low-risk aspect or boost confidence in a way that suggests current public safety as a direct result. I could even say that the quarantine could increase fears, and the statement is merely factual.\n\nMy conclusion is that this segment doesn't meet the Q5 criteria. Therefore, my answer to Q5 is \"no.\" I'm also ready to provide the necessary JSON response."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment 'Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA' contains neither a minimiser nor a scale contrast element required for Q6.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment for Reassurance Pattern Q6**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this segment, \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA,\" against Q6 of my internal checklist. That means I need to look for a specific pattern: a \"Minimizer + Scale Contrast\" used for reassurance.  Essentially, the goal is to see if the text uses a word like \"only\" or \"just\" *along with* some contrasting scale, like \"out of millions,\" to downplay the impact of something.\n\nLet's break it down: \"Farms where HPAI is found\" is the focus – that's the subject of my evaluation.  \"Are automatically quarantined by USDA\" describes the action, the response.\n\nNow, does this contain a minimizer? Nope. No \"only,\" no \"just,\" nothing like that.  Does it present a scale contrast? Again, no. There's nothing about how many farms are *not* quarantined, or how significant this action is compared to a larger context. It's a straightforward statement of procedure.\n\nTherefore, because neither of the required elements – a minimizer and a scale contrast – are present, the answer to Q6 is definitively \"no.\" Since the instructions indicated that a \"no\" answer would mean I move on to the next question, I'm confident in my response. I'm ready to proceed to Q7 if needed, but for now, I'm just focusing on providing the JSON for Q6."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes an action ('are automatically quarantined') and does not contain a bare negation.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the statement: \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\" My task is to evaluate this against Question Q7, which, as I recall, is designed to spot instances of \"bare negation\" lacking any calming cue. Let me break down my thought process:\n\nFirst, I need to *carefully analyze* the segment. It describes a procedural action – quarantine – triggered by the presence of HPAI. My brain immediately looks for any negative indicators. Is there a \"not,\" a \"no,\" a \"never,\" a \"rarely\"? No, I don't see any of those typical negation words. This is promising.\n\nNow, I'll go back to Q7's core. Q7 specifically wants the absence of calming qualifiers alongside a negative. That isn't what is present here; it's a statement of fact, not a negation of something. The statement says something *does* happen, not something that *doesn't*. The focus is on the action itself, the quarantine, which is a *positive* action (in the sense of acting upon the finding) rather than a negation of risk.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can definitively say that the segment does *not* contain a bare negation. Therefore, the answer to Q7 is a straightforward \"no.\" I'll need to format this for the model, which is no problem. I'll construct a JSON object containing the answer and its rationale."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Describes a safeguard ('automatically quarantined') without explicitly linking it to current calm or safety.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q8**\n\nOkay, so I need to analyze this segment: \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\" My task is to determine if this aligns with Question Q8 of the decision tree. Q8 essentially asks if the text describes capabilities, preparedness measures, or safeguards *without* explicitly stating that these measures result in immediate safety, risk minimization, or calm.\n\nFirst, I identified the core concept: a quarantine process applied to farms where HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza) is detected. The key action here is the **quarantine**, a clear safeguard mechanism.  Then, I noted the presence of \"USDA,\" indicating an official, governmental body is responsible for implementing this safeguard.\n\nNext, I explicitly looked for any language that suggests immediate reassurance. Does it tell us the public can relax, feel safe *right now*, or that risk is minimized at this very moment? No, it just explains the process. It doesn't use any explicit \"feel-good\" or risk-mitigating language.\n\nNow, let's compare this to Q8. Does this segment describe a capability or safeguard *without* explicit reassurance? Absolutely. It describes a clear safeguard (\"quarantine\") but doesn't connect it to present-moment safety or risk mitigation.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q8 is definitively \"yes\". Based on my understanding of the Precedence Ladder and the decision tree's logic, a \"yes\" to Q8 results in a Neutral frame. I'll need to format the output as a JSON object with the answer set to \"yes\" and the rationale that the text describes a safeguard (quarantine) but doesn't provide explicit, immediate reassurance of safety or minimized risk."}
