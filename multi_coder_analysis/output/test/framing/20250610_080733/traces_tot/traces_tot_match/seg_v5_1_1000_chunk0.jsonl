{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'highly' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Claim Framing - Q1**\n\nOkay, I'm looking at this text segment and need to determine if it uses an alarmist frame, specifically by checking against the Q1 rule of this 12-step decision tree. Q1 is all about spotting intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly modifying a risk adjective. The user presented me with the segment: \"Health officials announced Monday that they detected a highly contagious strain of bird flu in two additional U.S. states, furthering a threat to the country's poultry industry.\"\n\nThe rule is pretty straightforward: `Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective`.  I quickly scan the segment.  I see \"highly contagious strain.\"  \"Highly\" jumps out at me as an intensifier - one of the examples provided. \"Contagious\" is definitely a risk adjective. And, crucially, \"highly\" directly modifies \"contagious.\" No other intervening words or phrases. That's a direct match to the pattern.\n\nThere's a note about a technical-term guard for \"highly pathogenic avian influenza,\" but that doesn't apply here. They're using \"highly contagious,\" not the specific technical term.  \n\nTherefore, based on the presence of \"highly contagious,\" which clearly fits the `Intensifier + Risk-Adjective` structure, the answer to Q1 is a definite \"yes.\"  And since Q1 is at the top of the precedence ladder, a \"yes\" here means this is classified as an Alarmist frame.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes\",\n  \"rationale\": \"Cue: \\\"highly contagious\\\"\"\n}\n```"}
