{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective. 'Soared' and 'ravaged' are verbs describing impact/consequence, not intensified risk adjectives.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Q1**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"Egg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015.\"  My task, as I understand it, is to apply the decision tree logic, specifically Q1, to this.  Q1 is pretty straightforward: it's looking for an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.  We're looking for that direct connection, a sort of 'really dangerous' or 'more severe' type of phrasing.\n\nLet's break it down.  \"Egg prices soared\" â€“ well, that's not it. \"Soared\" is vivid, but it's about price fluctuations, not the inherent nature of the outbreak's risk. Probably Q2 or Q9 material, at a guess. \"Outbreak ravaged the United States\"... ah, now \"ravaged\" is interesting.  It's a vivid verb, certainly painting a picture of impact, but that's the *result* of the threat, not a description of its risk. It looks promising for Q2.\n\nNow, the core of Q1: do we have our intensifying or comparative terms? No.  \"So,\" \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"more,\" \"less,\" are all absent.  And our adjectives aren't risk-focused. No \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" nothing like that.  \n\nSo, by the rules of Q1, the answer is a clear \"no.\"  I'll move on to Q2."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment uses the high-potency verbs 'soared' (modifying prices, a direct impact noun) and 'ravaged' to describe the event and its impacts, framing the situation alarmingly.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Evaluation: Alarmist Framing Detected**\n\nOkay, so I'm analyzing this segment: \"Egg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015.\" The task is to see if it triggers Q2 of the decision tree, which looks for alarmist framing. I need to scan for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlatives with negative nouns, or critical alert phrases.\n\nFirst, I identified two high-potency verbs: \"soared\" and \"ravaged.\"  \"Soared,\" in this context, directly modifies \"prices,\" an impact noun, which is exactly what the regex is looking for. This immediately flags it as a potential cue.\n\nThen, \"ravaged\" is always a high-potency verb according to the Q2 criteria. It paints a picture of destruction. Both \"soared\" (impacting prices) and \"ravaged\" (describing the outbreak) meet the conditions.\n\nSince I found these cues, the answer to Q2 is definitely \"yes.\" This means I can skip further evaluation and immediately apply the \"Alarmist\" frame, which is dictated by the Precedence Ladder for Q2 (VIVID-VERB). The decisive cues are both \"soared\" and \"ravaged.\"  I'll format my answer as JSON."}
