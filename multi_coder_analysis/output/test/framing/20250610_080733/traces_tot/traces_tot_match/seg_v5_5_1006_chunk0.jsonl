{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective, nor the 'deadly from the start/outset' idiom.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: No Q1 Trigger Found**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Tyson Foods said it does not expect the case in Kentucky to impact its overall production.\" My task is to see if it triggers Q1 of the decision tree. I know Q1 is all about *intensifiers* or *comparatives* modifying a *risk-adjective*, or that \"deadly from the start/outset\" idiom.\n\nI've carefully scanned the text. There's nothing like a \"very dangerous situation\" or a \"more risky approach\".  I didn't spot anything using the \"deadly\" idiom either. The text talks about *production impact*, which is not a risk-adjective in the sense that the decision tree defines. Therefore, I can confidently answer \"no\" to Q1.  I'll format my response as JSON now."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral verbs ('expect', 'impact') and contains no high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 cues.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Claim Framing (Q2)**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"Tyson Foods said it does not expect the case in Kentucky to impact its overall production,\" through the lens of Q2 in this decision tree for claim framing. Essentially, I'm checking for alarmist language. Specifically, I'm hunting for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative noun combinations, or the \"on high alert\" phrase.\n\nLet's break it down: \"expect\" and \"impact\" are the key verbs here. While \"impact\" implies a negative consequence, neither verb is particularly punchy or evocative in the way Q2 is looking for, like \"ravaged\" or \"crippling.\" No metaphors jump out at me, and there are no superlative-negative combinations to flag. The phrase \"on high alert\" is also absent.\n\nEssentially, this is a straightforward statement. Tyson Foods is saying they *don't* think this case will affect their production. It's a statement about an *absence* of impact, which is framed factually. The language is very neutral, really. It's not designed to whip up any sense of alarm.\n\nSo, based on this careful analysis, the answer to Q2 is clearly \"no.\" I'm now ready to proceed to Q3, although that step isn't included here."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the verb 'impact' which is not on the Q3 list of moderate verbs, and it refers to a future expectation, not a realised impact paired with scale.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for an Alarmist Frame**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with checking this segment against Q3 of the decision tree. My goal is to see if it exhibits an alarmist frame, specifically by looking for a \"moderate verb\" paired with explicit scale or impact information.\n\nFirst, I identified the verb: \"impact\". Then, I checked my mental list (or rather, the regex) for \"moderate verbs\" listed in Q3. \"Impact\" isn't on that list. Next, I considered the *timing* of the statement. It's a statement about future expectation, \"does not expect... to impact\", which doesn't fit the 'realised impact' criteria. Finally, I scanned for any explicit scale or impact information tied to those moderate verbs. While \"overall production\" is mentioned, it's not being modified by any of those moderate verbs.\n\nTherefore, since the verb isn't in my mental list of moderate verbs, and the statement is about a *lack* of impact, and there's no suitable scale information, it doesn't meet the Q3 criteria for an alarmist frame. My answer is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and contains no questions, rhetorical or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Rhetoric**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text: \"Tyson Foods said it does not expect the case in Kentucky to impact its overall production.\" My task is to evaluate this against Q4, which focuses on identifying loaded rhetorical questions that try to induce alarm. Let's break this down step-by-step, given my expertise in this area:\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the segment itself. It's a straightforward statement from Tyson Foods regarding their production expectations. There's no hint of a question, let alone a rhetorical one.\n\nNext, I review Q4. It's looking for questions that implicitly instill fear or concern, like \"Should consumers worry...?\" or \"Are we simply going to stand by...?\"\n\nNow, comparing the two, the segment and Q4's criteria simply don't align. There are no questions in the segment, declarative or rhetorical. The statement is just a factual pronouncement.\n\nApplying the logic of Q4, since there are no questions present in the segment, the condition for a \"yes\" response is not met. Therefore, the answer to Q4 is clearly \"no.\"\n\nMy rationale is simple: The provided text segment doesn't contain any questions, let alone loaded rhetorical questions designed to imply alarm, fear, or any sense of threat. It is a direct statement, devoid of any such linguistic devices."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statement reports a business expectation ('does not expect... to impact its overall production') but lacks explicit calming language related to safety, control, or minimized risk for the public or consumers."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states 'the case in Kentucky' and 'overall production' but lacks a minimiser ('only', 'just', 'a single', 'few') combined with an explicit scale contrast to downplay the case's significance.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" Pattern**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment: \"Tyson Foods said it does not expect the case in Kentucky to impact its overall production,\" and my task is to check if it fits the Q6 pattern – that's the one looking for a *Minimiser + Scale Contrast* combination to reassure.\n\nRight off the bat, I see \"does not expect... to impact overall production.\" That's a prediction about the *absence* of impact, which is close, but not quite what Q6 wants.  It's bordering on a negation of capability or a statement of expectation, which are more Q7/Q8 territory for me.\n\nLet's break it down.  \"The case in Kentucky\" is the event. It's *a* case, sure, which could be small. But is there a minimiser – something like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"a single\" – to explicitly downplay it? Nope.  The text simply refers to \"the case.\" The focus here is on whether this case will affect the company.\n\nNow, we have \"overall production.\" That's the *scale* we're interested in – a large, company-wide scope.  But is the \"case\" explicitly minimised *in relation* to that overall production using a minimiser and scale marker? Not really.  It's just the *potential impact* on overall production that is being negated, not the scale of the case itself.\n\nThe key is that for Q6, it has to be a minimiser *and* a scale contrast.  Like \"only one case among thousands\" or \"just a few incidents nationwide\".  Here, we have the large-scale \"overall production,\" but the \"case\" isn't explicitly minimised that way.\n\nTherefore, the Q6 pattern isn't present.  I'll answer \"no\" and explain this rationale."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'does not expect... to impact' is a bare negation without additional calming language.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm taking a look at this text segment, and the task is clear: evaluate it against question Q7 of the decision tree. Q7's all about catching \"bare negations\" - denials without any comforting language.\n\nThe text reads, \"Tyson Foods said it does not expect the case in Kentucky to impact its overall production.\" Right away, I see it: \"does not expect... to impact.\" That's the key phrase. Based on the examples I've seen, that's definitely an *Expectation Negation*, just like Q7 is looking for.\n\nNow, the next part is crucial. Is there any additional language that suggests reassurance, safety, or calm, maybe something like \"so there's no need to worry,\" or \"meaning things will continue smoothly\"? Nope, nothing. It's just a straightforward statement of non-expectation, with no extra framing.\n\nSo, I'm thinking, this definitely fits the bill of a \"bare negation\" with no explicit soothing cues. Therefore, my answer to Q7 is a resounding \"Yes\". It's a clear case of \"does not expect... to impact\". I'll format my rationale and output as JSON."}
