{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase \"highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza\" is used as a technical description or name for HPAI, similar to \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\", which is explicitly excluded by the technical term guard for Q1.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of \"Highly Infectious Pathogenic Avian Influenza\" in the Context of Q1**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a segment to evaluate: \"The discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.\" My task is to see if it triggers Q1, looking for intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk adjectives.\n\nImmediately, I zero in on \"highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza.\" The rules are clear: I'm to ignore the technical term \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).\" I also see that the regular expression (regex) I'm using *allows* \"highly infectious\" because it's *not* exactly \"highly pathogenic avian influenza.\" But here's the rub: does this description constitute a *technical term* or an *alarmist cue*?\n\nLet's break it down. I know \"highly\" is an intensifier, and \"infectious\" is a risk adjective. This fits the \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj\" pattern in Q1's example table, which indicates an alarmist cue. However, the *intent* of the rule trumps the literal regex match. I need to figure out if it's describing the *impact* of the virus or is a technical description. And here's where it gets nuanced: \"highly infectious\" *is* a factual characteristic of HPAI, not an authorial amplification of its *impact.*\n\nThe technical term guard is key. It emphasizes the *meaning*, that the \"highly pathogenic\" part is not alarmist *when part of the formal scientific name or technical description*. Here, \"highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza\" seems to function similarly, providing a descriptive expansion/specification of HPAI. The regex may identify it as a potentially alarmist cue, but given the specific guidance regarding technical terms, I believe \"highly infectious\" is part of the disease name or a technical descriptor in this context.\n\nLooking at the few-shot examples (\"so deadly,\" \"deadly from the start\"), I can see a clear intent to heighten emotional impact – something lacking here. The phrase describes *the virus itself,* not its impact.\n\nFinally, while the regex *technically* matches, the rule explicitly guards against \"highly pathogenic\" when part of the formal name. Given that HPAI viruses *are* highly infectious and the segment is referring to the virus, I'm going to apply the spirit of that guard. The addition of \"infectious\" seems to expand the descriptive name but doesn't transform it into an alarmist cue. In this case, \"highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza\" functions as a technical descriptor.\n\nTherefore, because this is a technical descriptor *within the context of a technical description of the virus*, and in light of the rule's focus on technical terms, I'm going to conclude that Q1 is **not triggered**. The intent here is to label a disease, not to provoke fear."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('discovery', 'detection') and factual description ('highly infectious pathogenic') rather than high-potency verbs, metaphors, or other Q2 cues.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Alarmist Framing (Q2)**\n\nOkay, let's see. The prompt wants me to analyze this text snippet: \"The discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.\" Against Q2 of the decision tree. Q2 is looking for alarmist framing - potent verbs, strong metaphors, negative superlatives, or the phrase \"on high alert\".\n\nI need to meticulously check for those elements. I'm looking for language that's emotionally charged or exaggerates the situation. Specifically, I'm checking for things like \"ravaged,\" \"nightmare scenario,\" or phrases that immediately signal a crisis.\n\nSo, scanning the text... \"discovery\" and \"detection\" are neutral. \"Highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza\" is factual, describing the *nature* of the virus, but the Bedrock Principle says I should focus on the presentation. This isn't using a high-potency verb to describe the *impact* or *event*. \"First detection since 2020\" gives context, but isn't alarmist. It's just a statement of fact.\n\nNope. None of the keywords or phrases I'm looking for are present. The language is descriptive and factual. No alarmist framing here.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q2 is definitely \"no\". Time to move on to Q3."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified 'moderate verbs' paired with scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for a \"Moderate Verb\" and \"Significant Scale/Impact\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to check it against Q3 of the decision tree. Q3 wants me to see if there's a \"moderate verb\" paired with information about \"significant scale or impact.\" First, I'll go through the text and pick out the verbs: I see \"discovery,\" \"was,\" and \"said.\"\n\nNow, the crucial step: I need to check if any of these verbs are on the \"moderate verb\" list. That list is pretty specific, and it includes things like \"hit,\" \"swept,\" \"surged,\" etc. I scan through the list, then check my verbs again. Hmm... none of my verbs (\"discovery,\" \"was,\" and \"said\") are on that list.\n\nSince I didn't find any of those \"moderate verbs\" from the list in my text, I can safely say that the condition for Q3 isn't met. So, the answer to Q3 is definitely \"no.\"\n\nTo wrap it up, I'll need to explain the reasoning: I need to state that, because none of the verbs in the text matched the specified \"moderate verb\" list, the Q3 condition is not satisfied. Now, let's format all that into a nice JSON object..."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement reporting a fact and does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Decision Tree Q4**\n\nAlright, I'm presented with a text segment and the task of evaluating it against Q4 of a decision tree. My focus is on determining if the segment contains a *loaded rhetorical question* designed to evoke alarm.\n\nThe segment is: \"The discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.\"\n\nFirst, I read the segment carefully. Then, I immediately scan for any question marks or interrogative phrasing. There's none. It's a straightforward declarative statement reporting a significant event – the detection of HPAI. It highlights its infectiousness and the fact that this is the first detection in commercial poultry since 2020. This is information, presented factually.\n\nConsequently, since there's no question, rhetorical or otherwise, the answer to Q4 is unequivocally \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the segment lacks the essential characteristic of a question, loaded or otherwise. I'll format the output as JSON, as requested."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a factual detection and attributes the information to the USDA, but contains no explicit calming language from the author or the source.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Reassuring Frame Cues**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with checking this text against Question Q5. My focus is on identifying explicit calming language that would trigger the Reassuring frame.  Let me walk through my thought process.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the segment: \"The discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.\"  Seems straightforward: a factual news report about a virus detection.\n\nNow, let's review Question Q5.  I'm looking for direct calming phrases, things like \"no need to worry,\" \"everything is under control,\" or explicitly stating that the risk is low. These are the kinds of cues that signal the Reassuring frame.\n\nI'll scan the segment carefully. \"Discovery of H1N1,\" \"highly infectious avian influenza,\" \"first detection since 2020,\" and attribution to the USDA. Hmm.  It's all purely factual. No attempt to soothe or downplay the situation is evident.  The USDA is quoted, but only in attribution of *fact*, not in making any statements of reassurance.\n\nComparing the segment directly to the Q5 criteria, it's clear: there's no \"no cause for alarm\" language, no mention of the public being able to \"rest easy,\" and nothing suggesting the situation is \"fully under control.\"  The statement about the \"first detection since 2020\" is a factual reporting of the situation, not an attempt at reassurance.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"no.\" My rationale will state that the segment lacks any explicit calming language that would trigger the Reassuring frame, as defined by Q5."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text states 'the first detection... since 2020' which indicates rarity over time, but it does not use a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) combined with a scale contrast ('out of X', 'among Y', 'nationwide').", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' in the Text**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to check if it fits the 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' pattern outlined in Q6 of the decision tree. My initial impression is that it's likely a no, but I need to be thorough.\n\nFirst, I'm scanning for any explicit minimisers like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" etc. I'm not seeing them immediately. The text starts with \"The discovery...\", which doesn't trigger anything. The phrase \"first detection\" immediately catches my attention. However, \"first\" relates to a time sequence and is modified by the *time* period (since 2020), not a minimisation of occurrence. It's a statement of rarity *within that timeframe*, not a direct minimisation of a larger scale.\n\nThe rest of the sentence describes the context – where (United States) and when (since 2020) the detection occurred. But it's missing the crucial element of *explicit* scale comparison.  For this to meet Q6, I'd need to see something like \"only the first detection out of thousands of farms\" or \"just a single case nationwide\". This text simply highlights the *uniqueness* of the event, with the temporal marker of \"since 2020.\"\n\nThe fact that this detection is in the United States does provide geographic context, but it doesn't meet the requirements. It doesn't include \"only one detection in the United States\".\n\nUltimately, the text is describing the novelty of the detection, but it doesn't explicitly *minimise* the impact using words that express a small quantity compared to a large scale. The criteria for Q6 require both elements - a minimiser and a specific, contrasting scale.  Since both aren't present, the answer to Q6 is a definitive \"no\"."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a detection ('was the first detection') but contains no bare negation or statement denying/downplaying a risk or problem.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text for a \"Bare Negation\"**\n\nOkay, so I need to assess this text segment against Question 7 of the decision tree. Q7 is looking for a \"bare negation,\" essentially a statement that denies or downplays a risk without explicitly offering reassurance. I've got the criteria for a bare negation in mind, things like \"not expected to cause problems\" or \"no human cases detected.\"  My task is to carefully scan the given text and see if I can spot any of those characteristics.\n\nThe text reads: \"The discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.\"\n\nAlright, I'm examining this statement carefully. It's reporting a *discovery*. It provides details about the virus, its location, and the timing of its detection. It highlights the novelty of the find, referencing a previous instance from 2020. I'm focusing on language that would negate or downplay a potential risk. But I don't see anything like that.  No \"not expected to...\" or \"no...\" or \"will not...\" or \"doesn't pose a risk...\" It's simply stating a fact about a recent detection. There's no attempt to minimize the potential impact or offer explicit reassurance.\n\nTherefore, after a thorough review, my conclusion is that the segment *does not* contain a bare negation. Based on my analysis, Q7's answer is \"no\".\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The provided text segment does not contain a 'bare negation'. It reports the discovery of a virus but does not deny or downplay any associated risks or problems.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a factual discovery and does not describe capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and need to assess it based on Question Q8 of a 12-step decision tree.  My understanding is that Q8 wants me to determine if the segment describes capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards – but importantly, *without* actively linking these to a sense of current calm or safety. Essentially, it's looking for those \"we're ready, we can handle this\" statements that aren't also trying to reassure the audience.\n\nThe text reads, \"The discovery of the H1N1 strain... in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection... since 2020.\"  My first thought is, this seems straightforward. It's a reporting of a detection event. Let's break it down against Q8's criteria.\n\n*   **Capabilities?** No, nothing about *what* we can do.\n*   **Preparedness?** Nope. Not a mention of preventative measures or readiness.\n*   **Hopeful possibilities?**  No, this isn't about the *future*.\n*   **Safeguards?**  Again, nothing about systems or actions to mitigate the risk.\n\nEssentially, it's just a factual reporting of a virus detection. It doesn't describe any actions, systems in place, or even future plans. The question is if it describes capabilities/preparedness, etc. *without* reassurance. But it's not describing capabilities at all! Therefore, the premise of the question isn't met.\n\nThe question explicitly asks if it's describing capabilities *without* any active link to calm, safety, etc. It can't be *without* linking to calm if there are no capabilities to begin with!\n\nQ8 is asking about Capability/Preparedness without Active Reassurance.  The examples provided are all about *actions* related to managing a threat - vaccine making, systems in place, and stockpiling. This segment is just a news report. It doesn't have any of those keywords that trigger a Capability/Preparedness response.\n\nBased on my analysis, I'm confident that the answer to Q8 is a solid \"no.\" The segment doesn't discuss any capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards. Since it does not describe capabilities, the condition for this question is not met. So, the JSON I'll generate will reflect this: the answer \"no\" with a rationale that succinctly explains that the text is simply a factual report and omits capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.\n\nThe JSON will be:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment reports a factual discovery and does not describe capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.\"\n}\n```\nThis accurately reflects my thought process and the outcome of the analysis."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports the detection of a virus, not prices, economic data, or numerical metrics as defined by Q9.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against Decision Tree Q9**\n\nOkay, I'm looking at this text segment and trying to see if it fits the criteria of Q9. I need to determine if it's primarily reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using those standard descriptive verbs and neutral adverbs. No vivid language, no risk assessments, no explicit framing.\n\nRight off the bat, I can tell this isn't about prices or economic data in the way Q9 is looking for. This is a report about a virus detection. It mentions \"first detection since 2020,\" but that's just a historical point of reference, not a metric being tracked or analyzed like, say, market prices or quarterly revenue. \n\nSo, based on my understanding of Q9, this segment simply doesn't fit the bill. My answer has to be a firm \"no.\""}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a past event and its significance; it does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to apply Q10 of the decision tree to this text snippet: \"The discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.\"  The core question is whether this segment *speculates* about future relief or improvement without explicitly commenting on the current state.\n\nMy expert judgment is that it *doesn't*.  I'm looking closely for any hints of future-oriented language, anything suggestive of \"what might happen,\" \"could get better,\" or \"we hope this leads to...\" but I don't see it. This segment is firmly rooted in the *past* and the *present*: the *discovery* happened last week, and this is the first detection *since* 2020.  There's no speculation, no modal verbs like \"may\" or \"could,\" no predictive words, nothing implying a change or improvement on the horizon. It's a straight-up factual report.\n\nTherefore, Q10 is a \"no\" for me. And since I'm providing the answer in JSON format, here's what I'll send:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment does not contain any language speculating about potential future relief or improvement. It reports a past event and its context, without any modal verbs or predictive indicators.\"\n}\n```\nThat should be sufficient."}

I need to dig into the quote and identify if the USDA is being alarmist or reassuring in any way.\n\nNow, \"highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza\" is descriptive, but not framing. It's just a description. The part I'm really looking at is: \"was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020.\"\n\nThis is simply a factual statement, reporting the timing of the detection. There's no emotional spin here. No \"alarming,\" no \"worrying,\" no \"safe,\" no \"under control.\" It's just a straightforward reporting of an event.\n\nTherefore, because there's no framing language from the USDA that leans toward alarmism or reassurance, my answer to Q11 is \"no.\" This section doesn't have a dominant framed quotation. This means I'd move onto Q12, which isn't part of this exercise."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The text reports the factual detection of a virus using technical descriptors without explicit alarmist or reassuring framing cues.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and asked to apply the Q12 rule, which boils down to: \"Is this Neutral?\"  Essentially, I'm looking for anything that would trigger one of the previous eleven rules – either Alarmist or Reassuring language.\n\nMy initial scan focuses on identifying any explicit cues. I'm looking for things like intensifiers, vivid verbs painting a picture of impact, scale exaggerations, loaded metaphors, or explicit reassurance. And also to see if there is bare negation or any capability statements.\n\nThe text describes the detection of HPAI, a highly infectious avian influenza strain, in Indiana.  I see phrases like \"discovery,\" \"detection,\" and \"said,\" which are factual verbs. The description of the virus, \"highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza,\" is a technical classification. While \"highly infectious\" and \"pathogenic\" sound negative, they are part of the *official* description and not amplified.\n\nThere's no language that's ratcheting up the drama or trying to calm anyone down directly. No \"disaster looming\" or \"don't worry, be happy\" vibes.  It's just the facts: where, when, and what.\n\nIt's a negative event – the detection of a dangerous virus.  But the *presentation* is purely descriptive.  I'm dealing with severe facts, and they are being stated factually. The text is not sensationalizing the information. The Q12 guidance is clear: severe facts presented factually are Neutral.\n\nTherefore, because there are no explicit alarmist or reassuring framing cues, Q12 applies. The frame is Neutral.  My answer is \"yes.\" I'm confident in my assessment."}
