{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'highly pathogenic' is part of the technical term 'highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)' and is excluded by the rules for Q1.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Claim Framing: Q1 Evaluation**\n\nOkay, I'm at Q1 of the decision tree, the \"intensifier/comparative + risk-adjective\" check. The segment in question is about HPAI in a chicken flock: \"Tyson Foods... confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)...\". My immediate thought is to scan for that pattern, and, of course, \"highly pathogenic\" jumps out. However, I have to be precise here. The rules for Q1, and especially the \"Technical-term guard,\" are explicit. The phrase \"highly pathogenic\" *is* part of a technical term, the name of the disease itself. It's not the author's intentional intensification of a more general risk. Applying the technical term guard explicitly dictates it's **neutral**, unless further cues emerge, which I don't yet see.\n\nTherefore, the presence of \"highly pathogenic\" here *doesn't* satisfy the requirements of Q1. It's part of the nomenclature, not an authorial move to amplify the risk. My answer to Q1 has to be \"no.\" The rationale I'll provide is clear: while \"highly pathogenic\" appears, it's integral to the technical term \"HPAI\" and is excluded by the Q1 rules, which prioritize authorial amplification of risk."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'infected' is a factual, moderate term and does not meet the criteria for a high-potency verb or other Q2 patterns.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Decision: Evaluating the Text for Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, I'm examining this text segment, \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky,\" against the criteria for Question 2 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if the language used is alarmist, specifically through high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative noun combinations, or the phrase \"on high alert.\"\n\nI immediately focus on the verb \"infected.\" I know I need to compare it to a list of high-potency verbs. Let's see... *ravaged, devastated, skyrocketed, plummeted, crashed, nosedived, tanked, slaughtered, exploding, raging, tearing through, overwhelmed, crippling, soared/soaring*... Nope, \"infected\" isn't there. It's a technical term, describing a biological state.\n\nNext, I scan for any potent metaphors – a \"ticking time-bomb,\" a \"nightmare scenario,\" a \"raging inferno,\" a \"powder keg,\" a \"house of cards\" – nothing. Then I check for superlative-negative noun pairings: \"most/record/worst\" followed by \"disaster/crisis/outbreak/catastrophe/calamity.\" Still nothing. And lastly, \"on high alert\" or some similar framing is absent.\n\nTherefore, considering the objective criteria and the provided rules, I conclude that the answer to Q2 is \"no.\" The language doesn't employ the kind of alarmist framing that this question is looking for. The verb \"infected\" is factual and technical, not designed to exaggerate the severity of the situation.  I'm ready to move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'has infected' is a plain factual verb, not a moderate verb from the specified list, and the scale 'a flock at one of its contract farms' is not presented as significant scale/impact.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of Question Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\" My task is to evaluate this snippet against Question Q3 of that 12-step decision tree. Remember, Q3 is all about sniffing out those \"Alarmist\" frames, specifically by checking if we have a \"moderate verb\" paired with \"significant scale or impact.\"\n\nFirst, I identified the key verb here: \"has infected.\" Now, I had to consult the regex for Q3 to see if \"has infected\" is considered a moderate verb in this context. The regex lists verbs like `hit`, `swept`, `surged`, etc. Nope, \"infected\" isn't on that list. In fact, the rules *explicitly* exclude plain factual verbs like \"infected\", which is exactly what we have here. So, on that count, we're not meeting the Q3 criteria.\n\nNext, I looked for information about the scale or impact. The text mentions \"a flock at one of its contract farms.\" That's quite specific, and frankly, a pretty small scale - a single flock at one specific farm. It's not the kind of grand, sweeping impact we're looking for to flag an \"Alarmist\" frame. We're not talking about \"record losses\" or \"thousands affected\" here.\n\nSince the condition in Q3 needs *both* a moderate verb *and* significant scale/impact, and we have neither, the answer to Q3 is a clear \"no.\" The verb is factual, and the scale is limited. I can now move on to the next step, which for this project, means providing a simple JSON response for Q3."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement reporting a fact and contains no questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Provided Text**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to assess this text snippet against Question Q4, which focuses on loaded rhetorical questions meant to scare the audience. Let's see... the text is: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Q4 is looking for. It's specifically about *loaded* rhetorical questions – questions designed to provoke fear, urgency, or imply a threat. It gives examples like \"Should consumers worry...?\" which are clearly intended to elicit an emotional response. I know the nuances here. I need to be precise.\n\nNow, looking at the segment itself, I see a straightforward, factual statement. There aren't any questions at all, let alone rhetorical ones. It's just reporting that HPAI has been detected in a flock.\n\nTherefore, because there are no questions present, the segment can't possibly contain a loaded rhetorical question. The answer to Q4 is clearly \"no.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment contains a factual statement, not a question, so it cannot contain a loaded rhetorical question as defined by Q4.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text reports a negative fact (HPAI infection) neutrally and does not contain any explicit calming language or cues for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Against Question Q5**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with assessing the provided text snippet – \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\" – against Question Q5 of the decision tree. Q5, as you know, focuses on whether the text presents an explicit calming cue designed for reassurance, as defined by the \"Reassuring\" frame criteria.\n\nMy initial assessment is straightforward. I'm looking for telltale phrases or patterns from the pattern recognition table or the associated regex that would signal a deliberate attempt to calm concerns. The text, in my professional opinion, reports a negative factual event: the confirmed presence of HPAI. But it doesn't utilize any of the specific reassuring language we've documented: no \"no cause for alarm,\" no \"rest easy,\" no claims of the situation being \"fully under control\" or \"completely safe,\" and definitely no statements about the risk being \"very low\" or the news being \"excellent.\" There's also no explicit link to public safety preparedness or any minimization of current perceived risk.\n\nBased on my understanding of the Bedrock Principle and the Symmetry Rule, a neutral statement of a negative fact *is* neutral, not reassuring. It's simply a factual report. The text doesn't attempt to mitigate the potential alarm of the news with any explicit calming language.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion aligns with a \"no\" for Q5. The text simply reports a negative event factually, without any explicit calming cues. Consequently, I'll proceed to the next question, Q6, knowing that the text doesn't meet the criteria for a \"Reassuring\" frame at this stage."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'one of its contract farms' but lacks both a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) and an explicit scale contrast ('out of thousands').", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment for Reassurance**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment and need to determine if it uses a \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern for reassurance, specifically as defined by Q6 in our decision tree.  The segment is about a bird flu outbreak at a Tyson Foods farm. My job is to see if it downplays the news using the techniques we're looking for.\n\nFirst, I looked for minimisers, words like \"only\" or \"just\" that would limit the scope of the problem.  I didn't find any.  \"One\" is used, but it's just a bare numeral, not a minimiser like \"only one.\"\n\nThen, I looked for a scale contrast.  Does it compare the affected farm to a larger context to minimize the perceived impact?  The text says \"one of its contract farms.\"  That *implies* other farms exist, but it doesn't give a clear scale.  It's not actively trying to downplay the news with something like \"one farm out of hundreds.\"\n\nAccording to the rules, a bare numeral isn't a minimiser, and the scale contrast has to be explicit or very clear.  This segment misses both criteria.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q6 is \"no.\" The rationale is that the segment lacks both a minimiser and the explicit scale contrast needed for reassurance.  I'm ready to move on, though I was only asked to evaluate Q6 here."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states that HPAI has infected a flock; it does not contain any form of bare negation or statement about the absence of a negative event.", "thoughts": "**Q7 Analysis: A Non-Issue**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and the task is pretty straightforward: see if it's a \"bare negation\" situation, meaning a statement that downplays a risk without any kind of explicit reassurance.  My brain goes directly to the question's core - is there a *negation* here?  I scanned the text looking for those telltale phrases I've become so accustomed to: things like \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no evidence.\"  But nothing.\n\nThe segment just plainly states a fact:  HPAI infection confirmed.  No attempt to minimize or deny the problem.  It's just a report.\n\nTherefore, the answer is a clear \"no.\"  Q7 doesn't apply.  No bare negation present. Onward to Q8.  My output should reflect that."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not describe capabilities, preparedness measures, hopeful future possibilities, or implemented safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment: \"Tyson Foods...in Kentucky.\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this segment about an avian flu infection at a Tyson Foods farm. My job is to determine if it meets the criteria of Q8 in the 12-step decision tree. Essentially, I need to figure out if this segment describes capabilities, preparedness, or hopeful possibilities without explicitly linking them to a sense of current calm or minimized risk.\n\nFirst, I dissect the segment. It's a straightforward factual statement: an infection occurred. No mention of capabilities, preparedness measures, or future possibilities. No \"we're ready\" or \"we're working on it\" language. It's just a statement of fact.\n\nSince the segment *doesn't* describe any of the elements Q8 is looking for (capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, safeguards), the question \"Does the segment describe capabilities/preparedness without Active Reassurance?\" is, in effect, asking about a non-existent description. If there's no X (capability/preparedness), then there can't be \"X *without* Y (active reassurance).\" The condition of the question is not met.\n\nThe examples and pattern recognition in the documentation confirm this. Q8 is designed to catch segments that *do* describe capabilities but *don't* link them to reassurance. Here, there's no initial description to evaluate.\n\nThe logic is sound. The segment doesn't discuss the necessary elements, so it can't be a match. Therefore, the answer to Q8 is definitively \"no.\" This means I would move on to the next question, likely leading me to a \"Neutral\" classification since the segment states a negative fact factually. The negative fact is presented without tone. The Bedrock Principle and Symmetry Rule of factual reporting reinforce this conclusion. The overall analysis is straightforward, and the decision feels correct."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a factual event (HPAI infection) and does not contain economic data, prices, or metrics.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Provided Text**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess this text segment against Q9 of the decision tree. My understanding of Q9, and this is crucial, is that it's looking for reports *primarily* focused on prices, economic data, or numerical metrics. This means we're expecting standard verbs and perhaps neutral adverbs, things that describe the *data* itself.  We should *not* see vivid verbs, strong adjectives related to risk, or any other kind of framing that indicates an opinion or interpretation beyond the raw figures.\n\nNow, this text segment states: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\"\n\nAs I analyze this, it's immediately clear that this is a report of an *event*. It's a statement of fact: a disease outbreak. While there is mention of a major company and location, the core of the statement is about an incident, a *qualitative* event. It doesn't present price fluctuations, economic indicators like GDP or inflation figures, or even simple numerical metrics in the way Q9 is designed to identify. It is not reporting data about prices, or metrics about the state of the economy.\n\nTherefore, because this text segment does *not* fit the criteria for Q9 – specifically, it's not primarily reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics – my answer to Q9 has to be \"no.\""}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a current event (infection) and does not contain language speculating about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Decision Tree Question Q10**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with evaluating this segment against Q10 of the decision tree. Q10 is pretty straightforward: does the text speculate about future improvement or relief *without* offering any calming cues about the current state? Essentially, is it hinting at a positive future without grounding it in the present?\n\nHere's the segment: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\"\n\nMy initial thought is to scan for phrases that explicitly point to future improvement or mitigation. I'm looking for words like \"may,\" \"could,\" \"might,\" or phrases like \"will be short-lived,\" \"could ease,\" or \"experts predict.\"\n\nLooking at the text, it clearly states \"confirmed that...infected.\" This reports a *current* negative event: an outbreak of avian flu. It's a statement of fact about the present, not a prediction about the future. There's no speculation here. I see no language suggestive of potential relief or improvement, no hints of an end in sight, no attempts to downplay the severity with implied timelines or potential solutions.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q10 is \"no.\" This segment doesn't speculate about future relief or improvement. It simply reports a confirmed negative event. I would now proceed to Q11 if the prompt extended to that stage, but for the purpose of the initial question, I'm confident in my \"no\" response and the associated rationale."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "No direct quotes or attributed statements with explicit framing language found in the segment. The confirmation is a factual statement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Decision Tree Q11**\n\nOkay, I'm looking at this text segment and need to determine if it meets the criteria for Q11 in the decision tree. Q11 requires a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame, explicitly provided by a directly quoted source.\n\nThe segment is: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\"\n\nFirst, I see an attributed statement: \"Tyson Foods... confirmed that...\" That's good, it's attributed. But what's the nature of the statement itself? It's simply reporting a fact: an HPAI infection.  I need to check for framing language attributed to Tyson. Does Tyson use explicitly Alarmist or Reassuring words like \"concerning,\" \"alarming,\" \"safe,\" or \"under control\"? No. The language is factual and neutral. \"Confirmed that HPAI has infected a flock\" is a statement of fact, not an attempt to frame the situation.\n\nSince I don't see any direct quotes and the attributed statement is factual, there's no clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring framing present. Therefore, I can confidently say that Q11 is not met.\n\nMy answer will be \"no\" and the rationale will be: \"No direct quotes or attributed statements with explicit framing language found in the segment.\"  And finally, I'll package it up in the JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"No direct quotes or attributed statements with explicit framing language found in the segment.\"\n}\n```\nThat's it."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues found. The segment reports a negative fact (infection) using factual, neutral language ('confirmed that... has infected').", "thoughts": "**My Thought Process on Framing the Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the final hurdle of this 12-step process, the default-to-Neutral check. I've meticulously combed through the text, applying the preceding eleven questions, and found no explicit signs of Alarmist or Reassuring framing. Now, it's time to confirm this neutrality.\n\nThe segment reads: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\"\n\nLet's re-examine this against the rules, just to be absolutely certain:\n\n*   **Intensifiers & Risk Adjectives (Q1):** The phrase \"highly pathogenic\" is technical terminology, not an authorial intensification of the risk. It's part of the official name of the avian influenza strain (HPAI), not a deliberately added embellishment.\n*   **Vivid Verbs (Q2):** \"Infected\" is a factual descriptor of the state of the flock. There are no dramatic verbs conveying the *impact* or devastation of the infection.\n*   **Exaggerated Metrics (Q3):** Not applicable in this text.\n*   **Explicit Calming Phrases (Q4):** The text does not use phrases intended to minimize or reassure the reader.\n*   **Bare Negation/Capability (Q5):** Not applicable.\n*   **Rules 6-11:** (Which I've assumed I've already evaluated) - Nothing there.\n\nBased on my analysis, this segment simply *reports* a negative fact: an HPAI infection in a chicken flock. It conveys this using neutral, factual language: \"confirmed that... has infected a flock\". No alarmist rhetoric, no added emphasis. The language is purely descriptive. According to the Q12 table, this aligns with \"Severe Fact, Neutral Presentation\". Thus, applying the Bedrock Principle and Symmetry Rule I conclude the frame is **Neutral**."}
