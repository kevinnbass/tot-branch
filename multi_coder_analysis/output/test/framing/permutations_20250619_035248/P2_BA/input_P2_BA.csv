800,seg_v5_3_800_chunk0,"A possible cluster of bird-flu infections in Missouri has grown to include eight people, in what may be the first examples of person-to-person transmission in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday."
408,seg_v5_032_408_chunk0,"This virus [The current H5N1 strain] just is not infecting lower parts of the respiratory tract in humans at this point. Now that [the virus not infecting lower respiratory tract] can all change in a heartbeat with additional mutations. This virus [The current H5N1 strain] just is not infecting lower parts of the respiratory tract in humans at this point. Now that [the virus not infecting lower respiratory tract] can all change in a heartbeat with additional mutations. But at least for now, it [the virus infecting lower respiratory tract]’s not an issue."
1272,seg_v5_9_1272_chunk0,"But during COVID-19, many vaccine-rich countries inoculated large proportions of their populations before considering sharing doses. We could potentially have a much worse problem with vaccine hoarding and vaccine nationalism in a flu outbreak than we saw with COVID, said Dr Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which helps fund vaccine research."
2030,seg_v5_3_2030_chunk0,The outbreak that began in early 2022 has been much less severe this year as fewer cases of the virus are being found among the wild birds that spread it [the virus].
803,seg_v5_003_803_chunk0,It is not clear if any of these people were actually infected with H5N1; they were not tested at the time when they were ill. But the fact that they [four additional health care workers] became ill after treating this patient [human H5N1 patient] raises the specter of person-to-person spread of the virus—a possibility that flu experts say needs further exploration.
1714,seg_v5_001_1714_chunk0,The number of dairy herds with documented bird flu infections has risen rapidly in recent weeks.
1506,seg_v5_24_1506_chunk0,"The vast majority of infected people have gotten it [bird flu] directly from birds, but scientists are on guard for any sign of spread among people."
408,seg_v5_039_408_chunk0,"Then, in 2012, I was at that time on the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, and we had data presented to that group [National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity] that essentially said, ‘we’re just one mutation away from the virus becoming a major pandemic virus.’ Then, in 2012, I was at that time on the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, and we had data presented to that group [National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity] that essentially said, ‘we’re just one mutation away from the virus becoming a major pandemic virus.’ It [the virus becoming a major pandemic virus] didn’t happen."
647,seg_v5_20_647_chunk0,"""Screaming very loud, whole-body tremors."" The first seizures lasted for 20 to 30 seconds at a time."
1714,seg_v5_005_1714_chunk0,The number of documented infected dairy herds in recent weeks has risen rapidly and several other states have confirmed initial infections in cows.
1645,seg_v5_20_1645_chunk0,Every home should have this [kit] for peace of mind.
1779,seg_v5_7_1779_chunk0,"Persons who own birds that come into contact with wild birds and cattle farmers are at most risk to come into contact with bird flu, but the risk of illness in those persons is still negligible."
721,seg_v5_028_721_chunk0,"Health officials have been urging dairy workers to wear personal protective equipment [PPE] in milking parlors, for example, given the sky-high levels of virus [H5N1] in cows’ udders and their milk. But milking parlors can be hot and stuffy, meaning it [wearing PPE]’s not comfortable or feasible to wear masks and goggles."
721,seg_v5_001_721_chunk0,"Facing increasing doubts that the U.S. can control the outbreak of avian influenza among dairy cattle, federal officials reiterated on Tuesday that they believe the country can still eliminate the H5N1 virus from dairy cows, even as it continues to spread to new herds."
408,seg_v5_026_408_chunk0,"If you look at the cases that have occurred since 1997, when it [H5N1] first emerged in human cases in Hong Kong, through to mid-2015 to 2016, those years were by far the highest-risk situation. We’ve seen very few cases in humans since then [mid-2015/2016]."
1186,seg_v5_5_1186_chunk0,"Giving evidence to parliament's Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, Griffiths said total turkey production for Christmas in the UK was usually about 8.5 to 9 million birds. Of these [total turkey production] just over one million had died or been culled. He said he did not know what the impact would be on prices."
408,seg_v5_027_408_chunk0,"If you look at the cases that have occurred since 1997, when it [H5N1] first emerged in human cases in Hong Kong, through to mid-2015 to 2016, those years were by far the highest-risk situation. We’ve seen very few cases in humans since then [mid-2015/2016]. And part of that [the reason for very few human cases] is that the virus has changed—it [the virus]’s mutated to the point of where it is infecting other mammalian species and birds at an increasing rate."
258,seg_v5_037_258_chunk0,"'The way I look at the current situation, I don't think the virus itself is necessarily any more worrying than what we've been seeing for the past 20-plus years. But what worries me right now is that this [situation] is a change in the epidemiology and the ecology of the disease."
644,seg_v5_010_644_chunk0,"'These avian influenza incidents will cause some disruption to egg supply as retailers reorganise their supply, but purchase limits or patchy supermarket shelves do not indicate a nationwide shortage,' said Australian Eggs' managing director, Rowan McMonnies."
1138,seg_v5_3_1138_chunk0,"An unprecedented number of outbreaks were reported in wild and domestic birds this summer, causing massive mortality among sea bird breeding colonies on the north Atlantic coast according to a joint overview by the EFSA, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the EU reference laboratory."
258,seg_v5_001_258_chunk0,"Veteran influenza epidemiologist Keiji Fukuda remembers vividly when he first became fearful that a virulent bird flu virus, H5N1, might be on the verge of triggering a devastating pandemic."

408,seg_v5_028_408_chunk0,"If you look at the cases that have occurred since 1997, when it [H5N1] first emerged in human cases in Hong Kong, through to mid-2015 to 2016, those years were by far the highest-risk situation.

And part of that [the reason for very few human cases] is that the virus has changed—it [the virus]’s mutated to the point of where it is infecting other mammalian species and birds at an increasing rate. But we’ve had no evidence yet that [the change/mutation allowing infection of mammals/birds]’s happened for humans or for pigs."
721,seg_v5_027_721_chunk0,"Health officials have been urging dairy workers to wear personal protective equipment in milking parlors, for example, given the sky-high levels of virus [H5N1] in cows’ udders and their milk."
