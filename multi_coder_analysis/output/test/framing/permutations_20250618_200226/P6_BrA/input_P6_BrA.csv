363,seg_v5_34_363_chunk0,"This article was amended on 11 December 2023 because Dr. Michelle Wille is at the University of Melbourne, not Sydney as an earlier version said."
363,seg_v5_33_363_chunk0,"Now with the areas closed, it's even harder."""
363,seg_v5_32_363_chunk0,"He added: ""It's already hard to estimate numbers in normal situations, because the area is huge and there are a lot of animals."
363,seg_v5_31_363_chunk0,"Many places in South Georgia are now closed to tourists, and even researchers have to go through a number of procedures to get there in a bid to stop the disease spreading, said Dr. Michael Wenger, who trained as a marine biologist and has been working as a guide in Antarctica for 18 years."
363,seg_v5_30_363_chunk0,A number of reports of mass deaths have come through tour vessels.
363,seg_v5_29_363_chunk0,It is challenging to record what is happening because of the size of Antarctica and the small number of people monitoring it [Antarctica].
363,seg_v5_28_363_chunk0,"Researchers from the British Antarctic Survey and the British government's Animal and Plant Health Agency are identifying possible cases, testing them [possible cases], and sharing data."
363,seg_v5_27_363_chunk0,"In addition to negative effects on animals, the removal of vast numbers of animals from the Antarctic ecosystem may have long-term ecosystem effects."""
363,seg_v5_26_363_chunk0,"Dr. Michelle Wille, from the Centre for Pathogen Genomics and the University of Melbourne, who is helping to record deaths, said: ""It's terrible news that it's now in the sub-Antarctic, and we are very worried about viral spread into the Antarctic."
363,seg_v5_25_363_chunk0,The H5N1 strain has not yet reached Oceania.
363,seg_v5_24_363_chunk0,"The strain spreading in Antarctica is clade 2.3.4.4b, which has decimated bird populations across the UK, continental Europe, South Africa, and the Americas, with seabird colonies experiencing losses of 50% to 60%."
363,seg_v5_23_363_chunk0,"The current outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1, which started in 2021, is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds."
363,seg_v5_22_363_chunk0,"Emperor penguins and chinstrap penguins have been taking significant declines, so if we get large outbreaks in those species, that could cause further pressure on those colonies."""
363,seg_v5_21_363_chunk0,"Dewar said: ""If we start to get outbreaks similar to what we've seen in South America that could have very big impacts."
363,seg_v5_20_363_chunk0,"The virus has killed an estimated 20,000 sea lions in Chile and Peru."
363,seg_v5_19_363_chunk0,"The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research said recently: ""Given the dense breeding colonies of wildlife in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions, HPAI is expected to have devastating impacts on the wildlife and to lead to catastrophic breeding failure and mortality events in the region."""
363,seg_v5_18_363_chunk0,"Many species in the Antarctic are found nowhere else, so the consequences for the region of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) spreading are unknown."
363,seg_v5_17_363_chunk0,"""If the virus does start to cause mass mortality events across penguin colonies, it could signal one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times,"" researchers wrote in a pre-print research paper last month."
363,seg_v5_16_363_chunk0,"Previous outbreaks in South Africa, Chile, and Argentina show they [penguins] are susceptible to the disease."
363,seg_v5_15_363_chunk0,"Penguins are starting to cluster together as the breeding season starts, and this close contact makes them particularly vulnerable."
363,seg_v5_14_363_chunk0,"Dewar said: ""It's devastating to watch that happen and recording all the cases we're getting."""
363,seg_v5_13_363_chunk0,"So far there are no recorded cases on the Antarctic mainland, home to unique ecosystems that are some of the world's most isolated, but the disease is expected to arrive in the coming months as birds move."
363,seg_v5_12_363_chunk0,"While a number of seabird cases have been confirmed, many including the elephant seals are still classed as suspected, pending lab results."
363,seg_v5_11_363_chunk0,"Lethargy, spasms, and an inability to fly are symptoms in birds."
363,seg_v5_10_363_chunk0,"Researchers reported that a number of elephant seals had been exhibiting symptoms of avian flu, such as difficulty breathing, coughing, and accumulations of mucus around the nose."
363,seg_v5_9_363_chunk0,"So far tests have confirmed bird flu deaths at eight sites across the Antarctic, and the disease is suspected with confirmation from tests still pending at 20 further sites where animals have died."
363,seg_v5_8_363_chunk0,"""There is a likely chance it could be avian influenza."""
363,seg_v5_7_363_chunk0,"""At some sites we've had mass mortalities, where we are getting into the hundreds,"" she said."
363,seg_v5_6_363_chunk0,"Dr. Meagan Dewar, chair of the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network, told the Guardian that the situation among southern elephant seals was concerning."
363,seg_v5_5_363_chunk0,"Cases have been confirmed 900 miles (1,500km) west of South Georgia, among southern fulmar on the Falkland Islands."
363,seg_v5_4_363_chunk0,"Since then, researchers and observers have reported mass deaths of elephant seals, as well as increased deaths of fur seals, kelp gulls, and brown skua at several other sites."
363,seg_v5_3_363_chunk0,"The virus was first reported among brown skua on Bird Island, off South Georgia."
363,seg_v5_2_363_chunk0,"Bird flu is spreading in the Antarctic, with hundreds of elephant seals found dead, and fears it [bird flu] could bring one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times if the highly contagious virus reaches the remote penguin populations."
363,seg_v5_1_363_chunk0,Researchers warn of one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times if the highly contagious disease reaches penguin colonies.
743,seg_v5_31_743_chunk0,"The outbreak has impacted millions of animals with outbreaks in commercial poultry and in back yard flocks, cows, wild birds, wild mammals and some cases among pets, mostly among cats."
743,seg_v5_30_743_chunk0,The is still a real risk for animals.
743,seg_v5_29_743_chunk0,"The general public's risk of getting sick with bird flu still remains low, according to the CDC."
743,seg_v5_28_743_chunk0,All were farm workers.
743,seg_v5_27_743_chunk0,There have been a handful of cases in other states including in Texas and in Michigan.
743,seg_v5_26_743_chunk0,"The CDC said there are no additional tests pending, but there still could be additional cases."
743,seg_v5_25_743_chunk0,Most people who are sick have pink eye.
743,seg_v5_24_743_chunk0,The latest human cases are mild.
743,seg_v5_23_743_chunk0,Earlier the CDC said that the workers who got sick had been culling poultry believed to be infected at a farm in the northeast part of the state.
743,seg_v5_22_743_chunk0,The CDC said Tuesday that there are nine known human cases of H5N1 among poultry workers in Colorado related to the latest outbreak.
743,seg_v5_21_743_chunk0,"Together the organizations [federal organization and community-based organizations] will provide training and information sessions about bird flu and the organizations [federal organization and community-based organizations] will expand access to testing, treatment and PPE."
743,seg_v5_20_743_chunk0,The federal organization [National Center for Farmworker Health] will use the money to partner with community-based organizations in impacted states.
743,seg_v5_19_743_chunk0,The CDC announced an additional $4 million will be sent to the National Center for Farmworker Health to help prevent more workers from getting sick with bird flu.
743,seg_v5_18_743_chunk0,"While there have been additional cases in humans with the outbreak, Shah said, symptoms have been mild and the prevalence is still ""extremely low"" and does not warrant a H5 specific vaccination."
743,seg_v5_17_743_chunk0,The CDC said it [CDC] still does not think a specific bird flu vaccine is necessary even among workers that are at a higher risk who work with infected animals.
743,seg_v5_16_743_chunk0,The seasonal flu vaccine does not provide protection against bird flu.
743,seg_v5_15_743_chunk0,"""This [initiative] is fundamentally an effort that relies upon trust and that trust relies upon us making the case for why the vaccine is important,"" Shah said."
743,seg_v5_14_743_chunk0,Public health officials on a state-level will bring vaccines to workers at local events and to areas where farm workers typically gather.
743,seg_v5_13_743_chunk0,"The CDC said with this new initiative, the seasonal flu vaccine will not be mandatory for farm workers."
743,seg_v5_12_743_chunk0,Anything we can do to reduce the likelihood that a new virus that emerges that has the transmissibility of seasonal flu with the severity of H5 is a risk that we want to reduce as much as possible.
743,seg_v5_11_743_chunk0,"""This [reassortment] is something that has occurred and it's a concern for that reason [reassortment has occurred]."
743,seg_v5_10_743_chunk0,"""I'm not suggesting that it [2009 H1N1 emergence] was a human-pig interaction that led to that reassortment [of 2009 H1N1], but it [2009 H1N1 emergence] was thought to be a reassortment-type event between a novel H1 virus and a more seasonal variety,"" Shah said."
743,seg_v5_9_743_chunk0,"In 2009 H1N1, what Shah described as ""a close cousin"" of H5N1, was thought to have emerged because of genetic reassortment of influenza A viruses in pigs."
743,seg_v5_8_743_chunk0,Reassortment has happened with other influenza viruses.
743,seg_v5_7_743_chunk0,"""Anything that is predictable is also something that's preventable,"" Shah said."
743,seg_v5_6_743_chunk0,"The risk of what is called genetic reassortment — when multiple viruses co-infect the same cell and replicate to create a new virus — is ""theoretical,"" Shah said, but ""because we know that it could happen, we want to take steps now to reduce that effect [of genetic reassortment]."""
743,seg_v5_5_743_chunk0,"A new virus could emerge that could be harmless, but there is also a chance that a new virus could be even more contagious, deadly or resistant to existing treatments."
743,seg_v5_4_743_chunk0,If two different strains of the flu infect a person there is always a risk that the viruses could mix together and create a completely new virus with a mix of traits from each one.
743,seg_v5_3_743_chunk0,"""Preventing seasonal influenza in these workers, many of whom are also potentially exposed to H5N1 viruses may also reduce the risk of new versions of the influenza A virus emerging,"" Shah said at the news conference."
743,seg_v5_2_743_chunk0,"The goal of the initiative is to protect the health and safety of livestock workers as seasonal respiratory viruses begin to circulate, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC said Tuesday."
743,seg_v5_1_743_chunk0,The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Tuesday a new $5 million initiative to offer seasonal flu vaccines to livestock workers in order to reduce the public health concern that a new version of the influenza virus could emerge among farm workers who are at a higher risk of getting infected with the bird flu (H5N1) virus that has been in circulation in millions of farmed and wild animals.
2030,seg_v5_17_2030_chunk0,Properly cooking poultry and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.89 degrees Celsius) will also kill any viruses.
2030,seg_v5_16_2030_chunk0,Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation’s food supply.
2030,seg_v5_15_2030_chunk0,Officials say bird flu doesn’t represent a significant health threat.
2030,seg_v5_14_2030_chunk0,But the virus is difficult to keep out particularly along the main pathways for migrating birds who are headed south for the winter.
2030,seg_v5_13_2030_chunk0,"Farmers are working hard to keep the virus from infecting their flocks by taking steps like requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn."
2030,seg_v5_12_2030_chunk0,The highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through droppings and nasal discharges.
2030,seg_v5_11_2030_chunk0,"In 2022, nearly 58 million birds were slaughtered as part of the outbreak."
2030,seg_v5_10_2030_chunk0,"This week, there have also been sizeable bird flu cases confirmed on farms in Minnesota, Maryland, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Georgia and California. But the biggest one of those cases [confirmed bird flu cases] was the Maryland chicken farm where 198,200 birds were killed."
2030,seg_v5_9_2030_chunk0,"This week, there have also been sizeable bird flu cases confirmed on farms in Minnesota, Maryland, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Georgia and California."
2030,seg_v5_8_2030_chunk0,Ohio is also one of the top egg producing states but it [Ohio] has seen only 5.1 million birds killed because of bird flu.
2030,seg_v5_7_2030_chunk0,"Egg farms tend to be much larger than turkey or chicken farms, sometimes with millions of birds. That’s a big part of why Iowa the nation’s largest egg producing state has been hit the hardest in this outbreak with nearly 17.3 million birds killed."
2030,seg_v5_6_2030_chunk0,"Egg farms tend to be much larger than turkey or chicken farms, sometimes with millions of birds."
2030,seg_v5_5_2030_chunk0,"But there have still been 8.1 million birds killed this year to help control the spread of the disease and 5.8 million of those have come just this month as several large egg farms have been struck. That [5.8 million birds killed this month] includes 1.2 million birds at one Iowa egg farm and another 940,000 chickens at one Minnesota egg farm that had to be killed."
2030,seg_v5_4_2030_chunk0,But there have still been 8.1 million birds killed this year to help control the spread of the disease and 5.8 million of those [birds] have come just this month as several large egg farms have been struck.
2030,seg_v5_3_2030_chunk0,The outbreak that began in early 2022 has been much less severe this year as fewer cases of the virus are being found among the wild birds that spread it [the virus].
2030,seg_v5_2_2030_chunk0,The U.S. Department of Agriculture said all 1.35 million chickens on the farm in Ohio’s Union County will be slaughtered to help limit the spread of the highly contagious virus after a case was confirmed in the flock this week.
2030,seg_v5_1_2030_chunk0,More than 1.3 million chickens are being slaughtered on an Ohio egg farm as the bird flu continues to take a toll on the industry.
721,seg_v5_035_721_chunk0,"He [Shah] added, however, that 'these factors [related to culling conditions and PPE challenges] do highlight a pathway to prevention,' with better engineering and PPE use possibly able to avoid future cases."
721,seg_v5_034_721_chunk0,"'We understand that PPE use was not optimal, particularly the masks and the eye protection,' Shah said."
721,seg_v5_033_721_chunk0,"The culling method used on this farm [poultry farm] which requires workers to pick up chickens and place them in a cart where they [chickens] are euthanized with carbon dioxide also meant there was lots of contact with the birds, officials said."
721,seg_v5_032_721_chunk0,"Plus, the fans were whipping up birds’ feathers, which can carry the virus [H5N1]."
721,seg_v5_031_721_chunk0,"Moreover, the industrial fans that were meant to cool down the barns where the culling was taking place were so strong that workers had a hard time keeping their masks and goggles sealed to their faces."
721,seg_v5_030_721_chunk0,"Workers involved in culling poultry with H5N1 outbreaks 'depopulation' in the parlance of agricultural officials are meant to wear full PPE, from boots to suits to masks and goggles. But officials noted that when the culling was taking place, it [the temperature] was over 100 degrees in Colorado."
721,seg_v5_029_721_chunk0,"Workers involved in culling poultry with H5N1 outbreaks 'depopulation' in the parlance of agricultural officials are meant to wear full PPE, from boots to suits to masks and goggles."
721,seg_v5_028_721_chunk0,"Health officials have been urging dairy workers to wear personal protective equipment [PPE] in milking parlors, for example, given the sky-high levels of virus [H5N1] in cows’ udders and their milk. But milking parlors can be hot and stuffy, meaning it [wearing PPE]’s not comfortable or feasible to wear masks and goggles."
721,seg_v5_027_721_chunk0,"Health officials have been urging dairy workers to wear personal protective equipment in milking parlors, for example, given the sky-high levels of virus [H5N1] in cows’ udders and their milk."
721,seg_v5_026_721_chunk0,The human cases [in Colorado] also underscored some of the challenges authorities face in seeking to prevent spread from animals to people.
721,seg_v5_025_721_chunk0,"The people [in the five Colorado cases] had different symptoms, with some experiencing the more traditional flu signs of fever and cough, and others having conjunctivitis, a symptom that’s been seen with some of the dairy workers who’ve been infected during the outbreak."
721,seg_v5_024_721_chunk0,"The five Colorado cases were all mild, Shah said."
721,seg_v5_023_721_chunk0,'That [transmission from dairy to poultry] is a hypothesis. It [the hypothesis] is a hypothesis that needs and requires a full investigation. But that [transmission from dairy to poultry hypothesis] is a hypothesis at this point.
721,seg_v5_022_721_chunk0,'That [transmission from dairy to poultry] is a hypothesis. It [the hypothesis] is a hypothesis that needs and requires a full investigation.
721,seg_v5_021_721_chunk0,'That [transmission from dairy to poultry] is a hypothesis.
721,seg_v5_020_721_chunk0,"'That [genetic match] does raise the possibility that this virus [H5N1] was transmitted from a dairy herd in Colorado to the poultry farm,' Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters."
721,seg_v5_019_721_chunk0,"Notably, the genetic sequence of a key component of the virus [H5N1] the hemagglutinin subunit was an exact match to the hemagglutinin sequences from two earlier human cases tied to the dairy outbreak, officials said."
721,seg_v5_018_721_chunk0,"On the press call, officials noted that there have been infected dairy herds in Weld County. They [officials] also said that a genetic sequence from one of the human cases indicated that the virus [H5N1] was related to the version that’s spreading among cows."
721,seg_v5_017_721_chunk0,"On the press call, officials noted that there have been infected dairy herds in Weld County."
721,seg_v5_016_721_chunk0,But the available evidence suggests that the virus [H5N1] possibly reached the 1.8-million bird poultry farm from an infected dairy herd.
721,seg_v5_015_721_chunk0,"The five cases (four are confirmed, one is still considered presumptive) were among people who were involved in culling birds at a poultry farm with an H5N1 outbreak in Colorado’s Weld County."
721,seg_v5_014_721_chunk0,Deeble’s remarks came as health and agricultural officials provided an update on a cluster of human H5N1 cases in Colorado.
721,seg_v5_013_721_chunk0,"'There are no clear signs that the outbreak [H5N1] is or is about to come under control,' a report from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health last month stated, adding that 'the probability of … persistent chains of infection is considered high.'"
721,seg_v5_012_721_chunk0,Surveys have also shown that farmers have continued to move cows even after they [cows] have shown signs of disease.
721,seg_v5_011_721_chunk0,"But experts still believe that the poor tracking of the virus [H5N1] officially, more than 155 herds in 13 states have reported infections, though it’s widely presumed that both numbers [of herds and states] are undercounts means officials don’t know the scale of the outbreak or all the herds that are affected."
721,seg_v5_010_721_chunk0,"The USDA has started providing more resources to farms with infected cows, which could improve the willingness of dairy farms to test their animals."
721,seg_v5_009_721_chunk0,"They [Outside experts]’ve argued that the problems that have impeded the outbreak response from the beginning from a surveillance system that isn’t keeping up with the spread of the virus [H5N1] to a lack of cooperation from dairy farms haven’t changed dramatically. And they [Outside experts] argue that the longer the virus [H5N1] persists in cattle, the more likely it is that it [H5N1] could mutate in such a way [due to persistence] that would make it [H5N1] more transmissible among people."
721,seg_v5_008_721_chunk0,They [Outside experts]’ve argued that the problems that have impeded the outbreak response from the beginning from a surveillance system that isn’t keeping up with the spread of the virus [H5N1] to a lack of cooperation from dairy farms haven’t changed dramatically.
721,seg_v5_007_721_chunk0,Outside experts are increasingly skeptical of that view [that the US can eliminate the virus] given the ground the virus [H5N1] continues to gain.
721,seg_v5_006_721_chunk0,He [Deeble] added that the possible future deployment of an H5 vaccine in cattle which is an idea that remains under discussion could 'further facilitate the elimination of this disease [H5N1] from the national herd.'
721,seg_v5_005_721_chunk0,"'We understand that this [virus] moves with the cattle and with the people that are closely associated with them, so enhanced biosecurity should get us to a point where we can arrest the spread,' Deeble said."
721,seg_v5_004_721_chunk0,"That [finding about transport/equipment spreading the virus] means that cutting the virus off at those points [of transport/equipment] can contain it [the virus], he [Deeble] said, noting that officials have not seen new introductions of the virus to dairy cows from birds since the outbreak started, likely late last year."
721,seg_v5_003_721_chunk0,"The reason for that confidence [in elimination], Deeble said, is that investigations have shown it’s the transport of cows, as well as the shared use of equipment and vehicles, that is spreading the virus [H5N1]."
721,seg_v5_002_721_chunk0,"'All the signs that we have are, with good biosecurity, with good farmer participation, we will be able to eliminate this [H5N1 outbreak],' Eric Deeble, the acting senior adviser for the H5N1 response at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said on a call with reporters."
721,seg_v5_001_721_chunk0,"Facing increasing doubts that the U.S. can control the outbreak of avian influenza among dairy cattle, federal officials reiterated on Tuesday that they believe the country can still eliminate the H5N1 virus from dairy cows, even as it continues to spread to new herds."
1881,seg_v5_14_1881_chunk0,"The latest cases, if confirmed, would bring that figure [of human cases] up to 31."
1881,seg_v5_13_1881_chunk0,"So far in 2024, there have been 27 human cases of bird flu reported in the United States, according to the CDC."
1881,seg_v5_12_1881_chunk0,"In more extreme cases, infection with the virus can lead to vomiting, seizures, and death."
1881,seg_v5_11_1881_chunk0,"Bird flu symptoms in humans can range from mild to severe and can include conjunctivitis, mild flu-like upper respiratory symptoms, fatigue, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing."
1881,seg_v5_10_1881_chunk0,"The disease spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions and through manure, and it [the disease] can prove deadly in domestic poultry."
1881,seg_v5_9_1881_chunk0,"Other employees at the farm are also being monitored for symptoms, and testing, vaccines, and treatment are being provided to symptomatic workers."
1881,seg_v5_8_1881_chunk0,"Local health authorities are working with the CDC in response to the outbreak, and workers on the farm have been given personal protective equipment, according to the statement."
1881,seg_v5_7_1881_chunk0,"Testing of other people on the farm is currently underway, and the number of cases under investigation may change in the coming days and weeks it [the department] noted."
1881,seg_v5_6_1881_chunk0,"All four workers experienced mild symptoms and have been provided with antiviral medication, the department stated."
1881,seg_v5_5_1881_chunk0,"According to the statement, the outbreak prompted testing of workers at the farm, with samples tested at the Washington State Public Health Lab and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where they [the samples] await final confirmation and analysis of the virus."
1881,seg_v5_4_1881_chunk0,"Roughly 800,000 birds at the same farm were euthanized after test results by the Washington State Department of Agriculture on Oct. 15 showed that they [the birds] were infected with the virus, officials stated."
1881,seg_v5_3_1881_chunk0,"The four cases emerged at a farm that was the site of an avian influenza outbreak in chickens earlier this month, according to the Department of Health."
1881,seg_v5_2_1881_chunk0,"Four agricultural workers in Washington state may be infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, the Washington State Department of Health stated on Oct. 20."
1881,seg_v5_1_1881_chunk0,The workers who experienced only mild symptoms are employed at a farm that was the site of an avian influenza outbreak earlier in October.
137,seg_v5_37_137_chunk0,"The single European case was a person with no symptoms and prolonged exposure to ducks that lived indoors, Davis said."
137,seg_v5_36_137_chunk0,The strain circulating now lacks genetic characteristics associated with human infection.
137,seg_v5_35_137_chunk0,"One version of the virus has caused 863 human infections in 18 countries since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. Of those [863 human infections], 455 were fatal."
137,seg_v5_34_137_chunk0,"One version of the virus has caused 863 human infections in 18 countries since 2003, according to the World Health Organization."
137,seg_v5_33_137_chunk0,"This H5 strain of the avian flu has been evolving in the world's birds since the late 1990s, mutating and swapping genes with other avian influenza, said the CDC's Davis."
137,seg_v5_32_137_chunk0,"""Pathogens can leverage those opportunities."" That potential [to leverage opportunities] has prompted calls from some scientists to strengthen reporting techniques and information sharing around the world to minimize the risk of another global pandemic."
137,seg_v5_31_137_chunk0,"""Pathogens can leverage those opportunities."""
137,seg_v5_30_137_chunk0,"""We've created opportunities where wildlife, humans and domestic animals literally share time and space,"" he said."
137,seg_v5_29_137_chunk0,"Richards pointed to the COVID-19 virus, which has been found in a host of captive and wild animals, including lions, tigers, gorillas, cats, dogs, deer and mink."
137,seg_v5_28_137_chunk0,"The opportunities for new emerging pathogens to appear and spill over into people has increased in recent decades, researchers said."

1272,seg_v5_25_1272_chunk0,"Moderna's mRNA vaccine research actually began with pandemic flu, and was modified for COVID, said Raffael Nachbagauer, executive director of infectious diseases at Moderna."
1272,seg_v5_24_1272_chunk0,"COVID proved the potential of mRNA technology to adapt more quickly to changing viruses because the vaccines use genetic information from the pathogen, rather than having to grow the virus itself."
1272,seg_v5_23_1272_chunk0,"Experts have long advocated for new approaches in developing vaccines, both for seasonal and pandemic flu."
1272,seg_v5_22_1272_chunk0,"Some potential shots use a traditional method, growing the virus used in the vaccines in chicken eggs over four to six months."
1272,seg_v5_21_1272_chunk0,"At the same time, moving to large-scale production of a more targeted shot could take months, the manufacturers said."

1272,seg_v5_17_1272_chunk0,"Many of the potential pandemic shots are pre-approved by regulators, based on data from human trials showing the vaccines are safe and prompt an immune response, a process already used with seasonal flu vaccines. This [pre-approval based on trial data] means they [potential pandemic shots] might not require further human trials, even if they have to be tweaked to better match whichever strain does jump to humans."
1272,seg_v5_16_1272_chunk0,"In a pandemic, vaccine manufacturers would shift production of seasonal flu vaccines and instead make shots tailored to the new outbreak when needed. They [vaccine manufacturers] already have the capacity to make hundreds of millions of doses."

1272,seg_v5_14_1272_chunk0,WHO did not comment on the potential for vaccine hoarding in a flu pandemic but said mechanisms were being developed so that countries can work together not in competition with each other to respond to such a crisis [a flu pandemic].

1272,seg_v5_11_1272_chunk0,"By contrast, the WHO is seeking guarantees of 20% global supply for other types of pandemic in the wake of COVID."
1272,seg_v5_10_1272_chunk0,An international framework for pandemic flu allocates 10% of global supply for the World Health Organization to share with low- and middle-income countries.
1272,seg_v5_9_1272_chunk0,"But during COVID-19, many vaccine-rich countries inoculated large proportions of their populations before considering sharing doses. We could potentially have a much worse problem with vaccine hoarding and vaccine nationalism in a flu outbreak than we saw with COVID, said Dr Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which helps fund vaccine research."
1272,seg_v5_8_1272_chunk0,Many countries' pandemic plans say flu shots should go first to the most vulnerable while supply is limited.
1272,seg_v5_7_1272_chunk0,"Less reassuring, however, is that most of the potential human doses are earmarked for wealthy countries in long-standing preparedness contracts, global health experts and the companies said."
1272,seg_v5_6_1272_chunk0,"There has also been a push among companies to develop a bird flu vaccine for poultry, a market potentially far larger than that for humans."
1272,seg_v5_5_1272_chunk0,"Others, like Sanofi, said they stand ready to begin production if needed, with existing H5N1 vaccine strains in stock."

582,seg_v5_21_582_chunk0,"But because the other influenza A viruses that cause human disease tend to circulate at very low levels during the summer months in the U.S., the presence of high levels of influenza A in the wastewater could be a reliable indicator that something unusual is going on at least until the return of higher levels of seasonal flu in the fall."
582,seg_v5_20_582_chunk0,"Since the agency is not doing H5-specific testing at this time, the dashboard shows only overall influenza A activity."

582,seg_v5_11_582_chunk0,The WastewaterSCAN team hypothesized that those viral fragments [from H5-specific influenza] were the result of discharges from dairy processing plants in the area.
582,seg_v5_10_582_chunk0,"Wolfe and her colleagues went back and applied the probe to samples collected at three wastewater treatment plants in the area, and found the spikes were mostly due to large amounts of viral fragments from H5-specific influenza."

647,seg_v5_32_647_chunk0,"The way a dead-end infection happens, Weese explains, is that a person is around a large amount of the virus, or their immune system is too weak to resist, and H5N1 gets in."
647,seg_v5_33_647_chunk0,"But it is not a virus that's well-adapted to humans, so it never really builds up in respiratory secretions — the fluid that coats the nose, throat, and lungs — which would give it a way out through coughs, sneezes or even exhaled breath."
647,seg_v5_34_647_chunk0,"There have been at least three of these apparently dead-end infections in dairy workers in the US, who worked closely with infected milk cows."

45,seg_v5_4_45_chunk0,"Testing of the control-area farms will continue on a weekly basis, the agency said. The 18 commercial poultry flocks within the control area are under quarantine until further notice, it [the agency] said."
45,seg_v5_5_45_chunk0,"Animal Health Board staff have reached out to known hobby/backyard poultry owners in the control area to schedule testing of birds there, it said."
45,seg_v5_6_45_chunk0,"State officials have euthanized 29,000 turkeys at the infected farm to prevent the spread of the disease, said Denise Derrer Spears, a spokeswoman for the Animal Health Board."
45,seg_v5_7_45_chunk0,The agency said avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S.
45,seg_v5_8_45_chunk0,"The turkey infections are the first confirmation of highly pathogenic bird flu in commercial poultry in the U.S. since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has said."
45,seg_v5_9_45_chunk0,"A January 2016 outbreak of bird flu in Dubois County affected 11 poultry farms, resulting in the loss of more than 400,000 birds, the Animal Health Board said."
800,seg_v5_1_800_chunk0,"Seven people in contact with a patient hospitalized with bird flu also developed symptoms, the C.D.C. reported."
800,seg_v5_2_800_chunk0,Some are undergoing further tests.
800,seg_v5_3_800_chunk0,"A possible cluster of bird-flu infections in Missouri has grown to include eight people, in what may be the first examples of person-to-person transmission in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday."
800,seg_v5_4_800_chunk0,"If confirmed, the cases in Missouri could indicate that the virus may have acquired the ability to infect people more easily."
800,seg_v5_5_800_chunk0,"Worldwide, clusters of bird flu among people are extremely rare."
800,seg_v5_6_800_chunk0,Most cases have resulted from close contact with infected birds.
800,seg_v5_7_800_chunk0,Health officials in Missouri initially identified a patient with bird flu who was hospitalized last month with unusual symptoms.
800,seg_v5_8_800_chunk0,"The patient may have infected one household member and six health care workers, all of whom developed symptoms, according to the C.D.C."
800,seg_v5_9_800_chunk0,"Investigators have not yet confirmed whether any of those seven individuals were infected with the virus, called H5N1, leaving open the possibility that they had Covid or some other illness with flulike symptoms. Still, the news alarmed experts."
800,seg_v5_11_800_chunk0,"'We should be very concerned at this point,' said Dr. James Lawler, co-director of the University of Nebraska's Global Center for Health Security."
800,seg_v5_12_800_chunk0,"'Nobody should be hitting the panic button yet, but we should really be devoting a lot of resources into figuring out what's going on.'"
800,seg_v5_13_800_chunk0,"If officials confirm H5N1 infection in the household member or any of the health care workers, 'It means the virus is inching closer and closer to what would be a real pandemic virus,' Dr. Lawler said."
800,seg_v5_14_800_chunk0,'That is when Pandora's box is open.'
800,seg_v5_15_800_chunk0,There have been 13 other confirmed cases of bird flu in people since the outbreak in dairy cattle was announced in March.
800,seg_v5_16_800_chunk0,Those cases [confirmed cases] were all acquired from interactions with infected dairy cattle or poultry.
800,seg_v5_17_800_chunk0,Missouri has not reported any infected herds.
800,seg_v5_18_800_chunk0,The hospitalized patient was tested as part of routine flu surveillance.
800,seg_v5_19_800_chunk0,"The infection worried experts, because the individual had no known contact with cattle or birds."
800,seg_v5_20_800_chunk0,"There have been no H5N1-related deaths reported so far in Americans, and most cases have been relatively mild, suggesting that the virus does not have the high mortality rate of up to 50 percent seen in Asia."
800,seg_v5_21_800_chunk0,"But the small number of confirmed cases so far makes it difficult to estimate its virulence, said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security."
800,seg_v5_22_800_chunk0,"'If we're thinking about pandemic influenza, even in a worst-case scenario only a tiny fraction of cases would be severe enough,' she [Caitlin Rivers] said."
800,seg_v5_23_800_chunk0,"'At the scale that we would expect pandemic influenza, you quickly get to numbers that overwhelm.'"
800,seg_v5_24_800_chunk0,"In previous pandemics, health care workers have often been the sentinel cases, Dr. Rivers said: 'Across outbreaks, health care workers are often an early sign that something has gone wrong.'"
800,seg_v5_25_800_chunk0,"'If any of those six cases are confirmed, then that would definitely increase my level of alarm,' she [Caitlin Rivers] added."
800,seg_v5_26_800_chunk0,"In a news briefing two weeks ago, federal officials referred to the hospitalized patient as a 'one-off' and said no close contacts had become sick."
800,seg_v5_27_800_chunk0,"But the next day, the C.D.C. disclosed that someone who lived with the patient had developed gastrointestinal symptoms, which can sometimes accompany flu."
800,seg_v5_28_800_chunk0,"Two health care workers who had contact with the patient also developed symptoms, C.D.C. officials said at the time."
800,seg_v5_29_800_chunk0,One of those workers turned up negative for flu but may have been tested too late to pick up signs of infection.
800,seg_v5_30_800_chunk0,"On Friday, the C.D.C. added four more health care workers to the list of possible cases."
800,seg_v5_31_800_chunk0,"Three of the workers developed symptoms after the hospital instituted precautions against respiratory infection, but they [Three of the workers] were not tested for active infection at the time."
800,seg_v5_32_800_chunk0,Officials are now analyzing results of antibody tests that would reveal whether these individuals were exposed to the virus.
800,seg_v5_33_800_chunk0,"No one in the possible cluster has been identified, nor has the hospital at which the initial patient was treated."
800,seg_v5_34_800_chunk0,The investigation is led by Missouri health officials with remote assistance from the C.D.C.
800,seg_v5_35_800_chunk0,"Experts criticized this slow trickle of information and the lack of important epidemiological details, including the timing of symptoms in the initial patient and close contacts."
800,seg_v5_36_800_chunk0,"'Epidemiologists can get a lot of information out of dates and timing and the nature of the contact,' Dr. Rivers said."
800,seg_v5_37_800_chunk0,"The tone of official communications has also been unduly optimistic, Dr. Lawler said."
800,seg_v5_38_800_chunk0,"'The messaging that has come out has been maybe a little more confident and a little more placating than it probably should be,' he [Dr. Lawler] said."
800,seg_v5_39_800_chunk0,'It does not help to build back the credibility of the public health sector.'
800,seg_v5_40_800_chunk0,"Ideally, the first case would have led to a full investigation, but Missouri health officials did not get confirmation of H5N1 until after the patient was discharged."
800,seg_v5_41_800_chunk0,"Even now, a thorough recounting of the investigation and timeline of infections would help clarify how the virus might have spread, experts said."
800,seg_v5_42_800_chunk0,"Because the initially identified patient had no known exposure to infected animals, he or she [the initially identified patient] may have acquired the virus from another person who was infected."
800,seg_v5_43_800_chunk0,"H5N1 has infected a staggering array of birds and animals, including mammals, over the past few years, but it [H5N1] has not proved capable of spreading easily among people."
800,seg_v5_44_800_chunk0,C.D.C. officials were able to sequence only a portion of the virus isolated from the hospitalized patient.
800,seg_v5_45_800_chunk0,"The analysis suggested that the virus had not diverged from the version circulating in dairy cattle, nor had it [the virus] acquired mutations that would allow it [the virus] to spread readily from person to person."
800,seg_v5_46_800_chunk0,But every new infection gives the virus opportunities to acquire those mutations and evolve into a form that could set off the next pandemic.
800,seg_v5_47_800_chunk0,"With the advent of respiratory season, cases of seasonal flu, Covid and respiratory syncytial virus may muddy the picture further, making it difficult to identify H5N1 cases."
800,seg_v5_48_800_chunk0,"'It's not even a needle in a haystack, it's kind of like a needle in a stack of needles,' Dr. Lawler said."
800,seg_v5_49_800_chunk0,"In the wake of the backlash against public health measures during the coronavirus pandemic, officials have been reluctant to compel people to get tested."
800,seg_v5_50_800_chunk0,But there are other tools that help officials gauge the extent of the outbreak.
800,seg_v5_51_800_chunk0,"Wastewater analyses have shown H5N1 spikes in several states that are not linked to infected animals or birds, although the peaks are usually transient."
800,seg_v5_52_800_chunk0,"If there were large numbers of undetected infections, 'We would see a really consistent wastewater signal,' said Sam Scarpino, director of A.I. and life sciences at Northeastern University."
800,seg_v5_53_800_chunk0,"Still, health officials should test wastewater in areas where they suspect the virus might be circulating, and investigate the source of any signals."
800,seg_v5_54_800_chunk0,"'We need to get this thing out of the dairy cow populations, because if it [this thing/virus] continues to circulate in these populations, it's just a matter of time before we're dealing with the big outbreak,' Dr. Scarpino said."
800,seg_v5_55_800_chunk0,'We have more than enough evidence now to know that we really need to take decisive action.'

408,seg_v5_057_408_chunk0,How would we know if the virus was spreading more widely in people?
408,seg_v5_058_408_chunk0,"First, you have to have a confirmed case in a human of a respiratory-transmitted virus that then resulted in severe-to-moderate respiratory illness—and then you just start picking up additional human cases in that area."
408,seg_v5_059_408_chunk0,Are scientists watching H5N1 closely to see how it [H5N1] evolves?
408,seg_v5_060_408_chunk0,We’re going to be tracking the virus to see is it [the virus] changing genetically and if the [avian flu group] 2.3.4.4b is the same virus we’re seeing here with the wild birds.

In the humans, we have not seen any changes in the virus yet that [changes in the virus] would support that it [the virus]’s now more human-adapted. That [Seeing changes in the virus supporting human-adaptation]’s going to be one thing we’ll be looking for."
408,seg_v5_063_408_chunk0,The second thing is just looking at the epidemiology: Are there people who are in contact with potential cases?
408,seg_v5_064_408_chunk0,I say ‘potential’ because we have not had a respiratory transmitted virus case yet in the U.S. The second thing is just looking at the epidemiology: Are there people who are in contact with potential cases? So I think that [looking at the epidemiology] will be important.
408,seg_v5_066_408_chunk0,"I say ‘potential’ because we have not had a respiratory transmitted virus case yet in the U.S. If we see one [respiratory transmitted virus case], will we see others around it?"

But I’ve been saying that [avoiding unpasteurized milk and cheeses] for 50 years for a whole lot of other reasons, too, public-health-wise. Surely, this [H5N1 risk with milk/meat] is just one more addition to that [the list of other reasons]."
408,seg_v5_071_408_chunk0,"I think the second thing is, of course, that, at this point, what data we have supports that pasteurization will kill the virus in the milk."
408,seg_v5_072_408_chunk0,But could you actually become infected by drinking milk containing the virus?
408,seg_v5_073_408_chunk0,We don’t know.

408,seg_v5_082_408_chunk0,We don't know.
408,seg_v5_083_408_chunk0,We don't know. But it [the uncertainty/situation]'s all the more reason why we need to be better prepared for the next pandemic.
408,seg_v5_084_408_chunk0,"At this point, again, the virus, as it [the virus] is, I don't believe poses a major risk to humans."

805,seg_v5_5_805_chunk0,I’m happy to talk about things that are in the news like H5N1.
805,seg_v5_6_805_chunk0,"But part of that, I think, is that a lot of what people have wanted to and needed to hear has been from CDC, or from some of our funded investigators."
805,seg_v5_7_805_chunk0,"I needed to get my head around what this job is about, and especially in the post-Fauci era, what the job is about."

805,seg_v5_10_805_chunk0,Part of the job that I think people don’t appreciate and I think Tony did so well is what I call scientific diplomacy.
805,seg_v5_11_805_chunk0,I felt my first responsibility was to really take a look at some of the relationships that had been really ruptured during the pandemic.
805,seg_v5_12_805_chunk0,"Remember, when I walked in last year, a week before the end of the fiscal year, at that point the budget proposed by the House was cutting the NIAID budget by 23.9%. We were the only NIH institute [being cut]. That [being the only NIH institute being cut] is what I walked into."
805,seg_v5_15_805_chunk0,"That [being the only NIH institute being cut] is what I walked into. And that [the situation I walked into] was a result of the majority really feeling like they did not believe that that much should be in the control of one institute. And that [the situation I walked into] was a result of the majority really feeling like they did not believe that that much should be in the control of one institute. That [the result of the majority's feeling] was an urgency, if not an emergency."

805,seg_v5_19_805_chunk0,"So I would say a lot of those first several months were working with our legislative staff, trying to get to know people on the relevant committees, trying to create relationships."
805,seg_v5_20_805_chunk0,"I guess my modest measure of success in that regard is that this year the House budget proposed a flat budget for us although the House did propose to split us up into two institutes, the Institute of Infectious Diseases and the Institute of Immunology, each getting the same amount."
805,seg_v5_21_805_chunk0,"I guess the other thing I would say is I spent the last seven years, including the pandemic, in a deeply red state."
805,seg_v5_22_805_chunk0,"I would say it’s a restart, but that’s a disservice to Tony."
805,seg_v5_23_805_chunk0,"We need to not admonish people for not doing what we want them to do and, unfortunately, I think that happened during the pandemic."

805,seg_v5_25_805_chunk0,And now it is generally one of the scientists who did the research. That [change in who was offered for interviews] was purposeful. That [change in who was offered for interviews] was purposeful. That [change in who was offered for interviews] was not escapism.
805,seg_v5_29_805_chunk0,Can we talk about H5N1 and Missouri?
805,seg_v5_30_805_chunk0,I am concerned.
805,seg_v5_31_805_chunk0,There has been an effort to be really cautious.
805,seg_v5_32_805_chunk0,The CDC’s kept their assessment of the situation fairly constant since it’s come out.
805,seg_v5_33_805_chunk0,"To acknowledge the obvious, we are in a hangover period from Covid."
805,seg_v5_34_805_chunk0,"To acknowledge the obvious, we are in a hangover period from Covid. There is not a lot of willingness on the part of anybody to be thinking about anything that would bring us back to something like that [the Covid pandemic]. And we can’t mandate mask-wearing, because it’s federal property."
805,seg_v5_37_805_chunk0,"But there was a fair amount of disturbance that we couldn’t, and people weren’t wearing masks, and one person accused us of committing a microaggression by not wearing masks."
805,seg_v5_38_805_chunk0,"But I thought to myself, it’s more that people just want to live a normal life."
805,seg_v5_39_805_chunk0,We really don’t want to go back. We really don’t want to go back. It [the pandemic experience] was so painful.
805,seg_v5_41_805_chunk0,We’re still all traumatized.
805,seg_v5_42_805_chunk0,We’re still all traumatized. Let’s be honest about that [being traumatized].
805,seg_v5_43_805_chunk0,Let’s be honest about that [being traumatized]. None of us [people] are over that [trauma].
805,seg_v5_44_805_chunk0,"So there’s not a lot of appetite for raising an alarm, especially if it could be perceived subsequently as a false alarm."
805,seg_v5_45_805_chunk0,Would we like more information about what’s going on in Missouri?
805,seg_v5_46_805_chunk0,There are these wisps of a hint of a potential and I say all those words because I don’t want to be alarmist of person-to-person spread.
805,seg_v5_47_805_chunk0,"In the absence of further information, you just can’t help but worry, knowing that we are seeing in animal models that there is transmissibility of this H5N1 through the respiratory route, which we would totally expect from this virus."
805,seg_v5_48_805_chunk0,"I think the other thing I worry about is that CDC has this sentinel surveillance for influenza-like illness, which is very non-specific, and I am very concerned if we start to see spread of this [H5N1], we are going to see it in people who are immunocompromised like this person [health worker in Missouri], who had structural lung disease is my understanding."
805,seg_v5_49_805_chunk0,"I think the other thing I worry about is that CDC has this sentinel surveillance for influenza-like illness, which is very non-specific, and I am very concerned if we start to see spread of this [H5N1], we are going to see it in people who are immunocompromised like this person [health worker in Missouri], who had structural lung disease is my understanding. That’s [the immunocompromised group] a group that is vulnerable to getting infected with a lot of things."
805,seg_v5_50_805_chunk0,And I worry there’s going to be delayed diagnosis and delayed detection.
805,seg_v5_51_805_chunk0,"And I worry there’s going to be delayed diagnosis and delayed detection. In other words, they [immunocompromised people with illness] may not show up in your regular surveillance systems where you’re looking in ERs. And I think this virus, you’ve just got to respect it."
805,seg_v5_53_805_chunk0,One of the other things I wanted to ask you about is mpox.
805,seg_v5_54_805_chunk0,"In particular, do you think this new clade Ib outbreak is stoppable?"
805,seg_v5_55_805_chunk0,It feels like these viruses found the HOV lane by getting into sexual networks.
805,seg_v5_56_805_chunk0,It feels like these viruses [mpox viruses] found the HOV lane by getting into sexual networks. I don’t think you can put it [the mpox outbreak] back into the box.
805,seg_v5_57_805_chunk0,"When you’ve got planes, or people having sex or human contact, and when you have people breathing, the genie’s out of the bottle."
805,seg_v5_58_805_chunk0,"When you’ve got planes, or people having sex or human contact, and when you have people breathing, the genie’s out of the bottle. I think it [seeing cases in other countries]’s probably going to be a matter of time before we see cases of clade Ib in other countries and I think the hope is that we can at least get a handle on what’s going on in the worst affected areas."
805,seg_v5_59_805_chunk0,"The problem is, I don’t even think we know what the magnitude of the problem is there, because some of those places are so remote."
805,seg_v5_60_805_chunk0,I do think it’s a very high alert situation.
805,seg_v5_61_805_chunk0,I think the fact that we have delivered now over half a million vaccine doses that is really important.
805,seg_v5_62_805_chunk0,"And if we can just sort of blunt the pace of the outbreak, we can take a step back and say: OK, how can we really figure out what the next phase of control can be?"
805,seg_v5_63_805_chunk0,Do you think at this point the world will ever get an HIV vaccine?
805,seg_v5_64_805_chunk0,"Scientific challenges aside, because of the existence of effective pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), you can’t do placebo-controlled trials."
805,seg_v5_65_805_chunk0,"How likely is it that an HIV vaccine will get over the finish line, even if people figure out how to make one?"
805,seg_v5_66_805_chunk0,"In terms of figuring out how to do it, there have been about four amazing papers out, largely from Scripps Research Institute and Duke University, in the last year."
805,seg_v5_67_805_chunk0,And I think the field is getting really exciting in terms of understanding and training the body’s ability to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies.
805,seg_v5_68_805_chunk0,"I don’t know if it’s going to be two years, three years, five years, but I do feel like there are some incipient breakthroughs. So I don’t think it’s time to give up."
805,seg_v5_70_805_chunk0,"The real question, I think, is why should we focus on vaccines at all and continue to invest in this thing when we have now lenacapavir, which is pretty perfect over the course of a six-month injection?"
805,seg_v5_71_805_chunk0,"What worries me is if we don’t have durable individual immunity, which I think you only get from a vaccine."
805,seg_v5_72_805_chunk0,"What worries me is if we don’t have durable individual immunity, which I think you only get from a vaccine. And by durable [immunity] I mean you do not have to have an encounter with a health care system every six months. So I still think that a vaccine is the Holy Grail."
805,seg_v5_74_805_chunk0,"Also, women in particular don’t take oral PrEP, especially in sub-Saharan Africa."
805,seg_v5_75_805_chunk0,"Yes, PrEP works. Yes, PrEP works. But if you don’t take it [PrEP], it [PrEP] don’t work."
805,seg_v5_77_805_chunk0,"Frankly, I think if we could get data showing that women could use event-driven PrEP, oral PrEP, like men do around sex, then I think it would probably work well."
805,seg_v5_78_805_chunk0,But event-driven PrEP was frankly designed for men’s sexual pleasure. They [men] could have safe sex whenever they wanted. They [men] could have safe sex whenever they wanted. It [PrEP use] is very different for women.
805,seg_v5_82_805_chunk0,"When you think about the expectations around sexual pleasure, sexual behavior, sexual frequency, and the purpose of having sex, which is often to get pregnant, I think that you can say we have effective PrEP, but we don’t have efficacious PrEP for women."
805,seg_v5_83_805_chunk0,"When you think about the expectations around sexual pleasure, sexual behavior, sexual frequency, and the purpose of having sex, which is often to get pregnant, I think that you can say we have effective PrEP, but we don’t have efficacious PrEP for women. It’s [PrEP for women] biomedically effective, but it [PrEP for women] is not hitting it out of the park. It’s [PrEP for women] biomedically effective, but it [PrEP for women] is not hitting it out of the park. It’s [PrEP for women] not even getting a single."
805,seg_v5_85_805_chunk0,I saw you quoted talking about having a strategic vision for NIAID.
805,seg_v5_86_805_chunk0,We’re working on a new refresh of our strategic plan.
805,seg_v5_87_805_chunk0,We’re working on a new refresh of our strategic plan. We haven’t had one [strategic plan] since 2017; I think it [the strategic plan] got derailed by the pandemic.
805,seg_v5_88_805_chunk0,"We really want a living document that’s going to be refreshed annually, and we’ll have individual pages that will talk about specific topics. So, what are the metrics for mpox, say?"
805,seg_v5_90_805_chunk0,What are the metrics for H5N1 or highly pathogenic avian influenza?
805,seg_v5_91_805_chunk0,If I were going to be here for five years I hope I’m here a lot longer I would love to see the promise of the malaria interventions realized.
805,seg_v5_92_805_chunk0,"The monoclonal antibodies and the new vaccine, which was actually studied in women who intended to get pregnant, actually reduced malaria."
805,seg_v5_93_805_chunk0,The fact that they included these women in the study is such a signal achievement to me.
805,seg_v5_94_805_chunk0,"I think if I could see some sort of comprehensive strategy to use the monoclonals, use the vaccine, think about specific allocation seasonally, age-wise, around pregnancy, you could make a huge dent."
805,seg_v5_95_805_chunk0,And showing that could create a path for serious control of malaria in the worst areas.
805,seg_v5_96_805_chunk0,I’m encouraged about tuberculosis.
805,seg_v5_97_805_chunk0,"There’s still work to do, but the Gates Foundation-funded study of the experimental vaccine M72 will be very interesting."
805,seg_v5_98_805_chunk0,Hopefully we’ll make some inroads there. And we’ll see what happens with HIV.
805,seg_v5_100_805_chunk0,And we’ll see what happens with HIV. I don’t think we’re going to end it [HIV] by 2030.
805,seg_v5_101_805_chunk0,I wish I could 100% buy into that idea.

1506,seg_v5_1_1506_chunk0,There have been numerous developments this week concerning avian flu that have raised concerns among experts.
1506,seg_v5_2_1506_chunk0,A poultry facility in Michigan and egg producer in Texas both reported outbreaks of avian flu this week.
1506,seg_v5_3_1506_chunk0,The latest developments on the virus also include infected dairy cows and the first known instance of a human catching bird flu from a mammal.
1506,seg_v5_4_1506_chunk0,"Although health officials say the risk to the public remains low, there is rising concern, emerging in part from news that the largest producer of fresh eggs in the U.S. reported an outbreak."
1506,seg_v5_5_1506_chunk0,"Dr. Mandy Cohen, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency is taking bird flu seriously, but stressed that the virus has already been well studied."
1506,seg_v5_6_1506_chunk0,"'The fact that it [the virus] is in cattle now definitely raises our concern level,' Cohen said, noting that it [the presence in cattle] means farmworkers who work with cattle and not just those working with birds may need to take precautions."
1506,seg_v5_7_1506_chunk0,"The good news is that 'it’s not a new strain of the virus,' Cohen added."
1506,seg_v5_8_1506_chunk0,"'This [strain] is known to us and we’ve been studying it [the virus], and frankly, we’ve been preparing for avian flu for 20 years.'"
1506,seg_v5_9_1506_chunk0,"Like other viruses, it [the virus] has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself."
1506,seg_v5_10_1506_chunk0,"Since 2020, the virus has been spreading among more animal species including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises in scores of countries."
1506,seg_v5_11_1506_chunk0,"In the U.S., this version of the bird flu has been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks."
1506,seg_v5_12_1506_chunk0,"Nationwide, tens of millions of chickens have died from the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading."
1506,seg_v5_13_1506_chunk0,"Last week, U.S. officials said it [the virus] had been found in livestock."
1506,seg_v5_14_1506_chunk0,"As of Tuesday, it [the virus] had been discovered in dairy herds in five states: Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, and Texas according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture."
1506,seg_v5_15_1506_chunk0,This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong.
1506,seg_v5_16_1506_chunk0,"In the past two decades, nearly 900 people have been diagnosed globally with bird flu and more than 460 people have died, according to the World Health Organization."
1506,seg_v5_17_1506_chunk0,"There have been only two cases in the U.S., and neither were fatal."
1506,seg_v5_18_1506_chunk0,"In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it [bird flu] while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado."
1506,seg_v5_19_1506_chunk0,"His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered."
1506,seg_v5_20_1506_chunk0,"This week, Texas health officials announced that a person who had been in contact with cows had been diagnosed with bird flu."
1506,seg_v5_21_1506_chunk0,Their only reported symptom was eye redness.
1506,seg_v5_22_1506_chunk0,"Symptoms are similar to that of other flus, including cough, body aches, and fever."
1506,seg_v5_23_1506_chunk0,"Some people don’t have noticeable symptoms, but others develop severe, life-threatening pneumonia."
1506,seg_v5_24_1506_chunk0,"The vast majority of infected people have gotten it [bird flu] directly from birds, but scientists are on guard for any sign of spread among people."
1506,seg_v5_25_1506_chunk0,There have been a few instances when that apparently happened [spread among people] most recently in 2007 in Asia.
1506,seg_v5_26_1506_chunk0,"In each cluster, it [the virus/spread] spread within families from a sick person in the home."
1506,seg_v5_27_1506_chunk0,U.S. health officials have stressed that the current public health risk is low and that there is no sign that bird flu is spreading person to person.
1506,seg_v5_28_1506_chunk0,"While it’s too early to quantify the potential economic impact of a bird flu outbreak, many of these latest developments are concerning, particularly the transmission of the virus from one species to another, said Darin Detwiler, a food safety and policy expert at Northeastern University."
1506,seg_v5_29_1506_chunk0,"'We don’t have a magic forcefield, an invisible shield that protects land and water runoff from impacting other species,' Detwiler said."
1506,seg_v5_30_1506_chunk0,"'There is a concern in terms of how this [situation] might impact other markets, the egg market, the beef market.'"
1506,seg_v5_31_1506_chunk0,"If the outbreak is not quickly contained, consumers could ultimately see higher prices, and if it [the outbreak] continues to spread, some industries could experience 'reputational strain,' possibly affecting the export industry, Detwiler added."
1506,seg_v5_32_1506_chunk0,"The egg industry already is experiencing some tightening of supply following detections of bird flu late in 2023 and in early January, coupled with the busy Easter season, where Americans typically consume an average of 3 billion eggs, said Marc Dresner, a spokesperson for the American Egg Board."
1506,seg_v5_33_1506_chunk0,"Still, even with the outbreak in Texas and the nearly 2 million birds that were killed there, Dresner said there are an estimated 310 million egg-laying hens in the U.S. and wholesale egg prices are down about 25% from a February peak."

1508,seg_v5_3_1508_chunk0,"Colombia imports a small amount of beef from the U.S. annually, according to government data and market analysts."
1508,seg_v5_4_1508_chunk0,"In a notice this week on the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service website, which was last updated on April 22, the agency said the ban includes beef products derived from cattle slaughtered in Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas."
1508,seg_v5_5_1508_chunk0,"Colombia imposed temporary restrictions on raw bovine meat products, the notice said."
1508,seg_v5_6_1508_chunk0,"If exporters have a valid import permit, shipments may still be held at the port."
1508,seg_v5_7_1508_chunk0,"The restrictions come as the U.S. government said it will require dairy cattle moving between states to be tested for bird flu starting on Monday, as federal officials ramp up their response to an outbreak that has bled over into the U.S. milk supply."
1508,seg_v5_8_1508_chunk0,"The measures aim to contain the spread of bird flu, which has been reported in eight states and 33 dairy herds since it was first detected in late March in Texas."
1508,seg_v5_9_1508_chunk0,A person exposed to cattle tested positive for the disease and suffered conjunctivitis.
1508,seg_v5_10_1508_chunk0,"To date, no U.S. beef cattle have tested positive for bird flu, government officials said."
1508,seg_v5_11_1508_chunk0,"Colombia is the only country that has officially imposed restrictions on U.S. beef exports over the H5N1 outbreak, said Joe Schuele, spokesman for the U.S. Meat Export Federation, an industry group."
1508,seg_v5_12_1508_chunk0,"'We don't feel that import restrictions related to the avian flu outbreak have any scientific basis,' he said, adding: 'It's certainly a big deal for exporters who are doing business in Colombia and for their customers.'"
1508,seg_v5_13_1508_chunk0,"USDA officials are talking with Colombia about the issue, Schuele said."
1508,seg_v5_14_1508_chunk0,"Trading partners have requested additional information on the government's epidemiology, Rosemary Sifford, USDA's chief veterinary officer, said in a webinar on Thursday."
1508,seg_v5_15_1508_chunk0,"'We are responding to their requests for information as we receive them, to provide information that assists them in mitigating any trade impacts,' Sifford said."
1508,seg_v5_16_1508_chunk0,USDA officials did not say which trading partners asked for such information.

297,seg_v5_007_297_chunk0,The cost of it [the disease] spreading is so much more than simply surveillance and control by good field workers.
297,seg_v5_008_297_chunk0,"Many low- to-middle-income countries have limited conservation funds, she [Sacha Dench] added."
297,seg_v5_009_297_chunk0,Most rely on international funding and some money from tourism to pay for the services of local park staff.
297,seg_v5_010_297_chunk0,"But when an emergency like bird flu hits, the government has priorities like chicken being important protein for local people."
297,seg_v5_011_297_chunk0,Rapid reaction is critical.
297,seg_v5_012_297_chunk0,"So having staff on the ground with the resources that enable them to act is essential, said Dench, who secured temporary funds for the boat fuel."
297,seg_v5_013_297_chunk0,"She [Sacha Dench] has written to ask the UK government to help fund the surveillance and disposal of infected birds, a critical matter for the government at a time when the UK's bird flu restrictions on free-range poultry are only just being lifted."
297,seg_v5_015_297_chunk0,"This [situation] is more than conservation, this [situation] is management of a global pandemic, and we should at least be offering assistance to those with less resources on the migration flyways that the UK sits right at the centre of."

760,seg_v5_015_760_chunk0,"Fairs in other states have made changes to try to lessen the chances of flu spreading among livestock, or to people."
760,seg_v5_016_760_chunk0,"In some states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, lactating dairy cows are still allowed at fairs, but only if they have proof of negative flu tests in the week before they arrive."

961,seg_v5_2_961_chunk0,"The authorities, which said they had yet to identify the strain, are to slaughter the chickens and disinfect the farm to prevent the spread of the disease, the ministry said in a statement."
961,seg_v5_3_961_chunk0,The outbreak followed several outbreaks among poultry farms in Europe and Asia in recent weeks in a sign the virus is spreading quickly again.
961,seg_v5_4_961_chunk0,"Several cases of severe bird flu had already been detected in France in the past month among backyard poultry as well as a wild bird, prompting the government to impose poultry flocks be kept indoors."
961,seg_v5_5_961_chunk0,A massive wave of the virus last winter led the authorities to cull over 3 million ducks in its southwestern duck-breeding region known for production of foie gras pâté.
961,seg_v5_6_961_chunk0,"Outbreaks can prompt importing countries, notably in Asia, to impose trade restrictions on poultry products."
961,seg_v5_7_961_chunk0,"They [Outbreaks] are also raising concern among epidemiologists as the virus can be transmitted to humans, especially as the world slowly recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic."
961,seg_v5_8_961_chunk0,"Bird flu, or avian influenza, is often spread by migrating wild birds."
358,seg_v5_1_358_chunk0,"Nearly 5 million chickens, turkeys and other birds have been slaughtered this year because of a persistent bird flu outbreak that began in 2022, but as big as that number may sound, it's far less than the number of birds killed last year which means consumers aren't seeing as much impact on poultry and egg prices."
358,seg_v5_2_358_chunk0,The 4.6 million birds killed this year compares to the nearly 58 million birds the U.S. Department of Agriculture said were slaughtered last year in the first year of the outbreak.
358,seg_v5_3_358_chunk0,"While that decline is welcome news, the fact that infections continue is a worrisome indication that unlike earlier outbreaks, the current virus has found a way to survive through the summers, and poultry will likely always be at risk of the disease."
358,seg_v5_4_358_chunk0,"The key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through droppings and nasal discharges, and it [virus] mutates over time."
358,seg_v5_5_358_chunk0,"Despite the best efforts of farmers, it [virus] is hard to keep the virus out."
358,seg_v5_6_358_chunk0,"“The industry is definitely on really high alert,” said veterinarian Denise Heard with the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association trade group."
358,seg_v5_7_358_chunk0,"As geese and ducks have started to head south for the winter, cases of bird flu have predictably begun popping up primarily at farms in Minnesota, Iowa and South Dakota along one of the major flyways for migrating birds."
358,seg_v5_8_358_chunk0,"Most of those cases involve only tens of thousands of birds, but 1.2 million birds at one Iowa egg farm and another 940,000 chickens at one Minnesota egg farm had to be slaughtered last week after the disease was found."
358,seg_v5_9_358_chunk0,"Still, only a small portion of the total flock nationwide has been affected this year, allowing prices to fall closer to where they were before the outbreak began."
358,seg_v5_10_358_chunk0,Egg prices peaked at a nationwide average of $4.82 per dozen in January — more than double the $1.93 per dozen charged a year earlier before the first bird flu case was confirmed in Indiana in February of 2022.
358,seg_v5_11_358_chunk0,"They [Egg prices] remained at $2.07 per dozen last month, according to new numbers released Tuesday."
358,seg_v5_12_358_chunk0,"Turkey and chicken prices also spiked over the past two years, but bird flu wasn't the only factor as feed, fuel and labor costs also soared as part of the widespread inflation that weighed on the entire economy."

358,seg_v5_14_358_chunk0,"Chickens raised for meat haven't been hit as hard by bird flu because that industry is focused in the southeast where there haven't been as many cases, and because those chickens don't live as long before they're killed for meat so there's less chance of infection."
358,seg_v5_15_358_chunk0,"but USDA reports show that wholesale frozen turkey prices averaged $1.15 per pound in October, down from last year's $1.79 per pound and the previous year's $1.35 per pound."
358,seg_v5_16_358_chunk0,"Farmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn."
358,seg_v5_17_358_chunk0,Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating.
358,seg_v5_18_358_chunk0,"“The biggest thing, of course, that we would stress from here is biosecurity, biosecurity, biosecurity,” Heard said."
358,seg_v5_19_358_chunk0,The USDA says the response to the outbreak has cost the government $757 million so far with most of that [cost] going to compensate farmers who have to destroy their flocks.
358,seg_v5_20_358_chunk0,Agriculture economists estimate that the industry has also suffered at least another $1 billion in damages from lost sales and other costs though the total cost to the industry hasn't been tallied up.
358,seg_v5_21_358_chunk0,"This outbreak is more widespread than the last big one in 2015 that killed about 50 million chickens and turkeys in 15 states, but it [This outbreak] remains less costly as the industry and government apply the lessons learned from that experience."

358,seg_v5_23_358_chunk0,Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation's food supply.
358,seg_v5_24_358_chunk0,Properly cooking poultry and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.89 degrees Celsius) will also kill any viruses.
358,seg_v5_25_358_chunk0,"Bird flu vaccines are being developed and might help in the future, but at this point they [Bird flu vaccines] remain impractical."
