{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: A Quick Scan for Risk Modifiers**\n\nOkay, so the task is to assess \"Police were blocking access to the affected area to non-residents\" against the first decision tree question. Essentially, I need to check for any intensifiers, comparatives, specific risk-adjectives, or that \"deadly from the start/outset\" idiom.\n\nI'm quickly scanning the segment, looking for those keywords or phrases.  \"Police,\" \"blocking access,\" \"affected area,\" and \"non-residents\" are all present, but I see no intensifiers like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or \"so.\"  No comparatives like \"more\" or \"deadlier\" either. And definitely no \"deadly\" or other related risk-adjectives (dangerous, severe, contagious, etc.) are used, nor the specific idiom.  While \"affected\" is present, it's a description of the area and not a risk-adjective that's being intensified or compared.\n\nTherefore, Q1's criteria aren't met. I'll flag a \"no\" for Q1 and move on.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or the 'on high alert' phrase.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q2 Evaluation: \"Police were blocking access to the affected area to non-residents.\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment, \"Police were blocking access to the affected area to non-residents,\" and the task is to run it against Q2 of the decision tree. I know the drill: Q2 wants me to find those strong verbs, vivid metaphors, superlatives paired with negative nouns, or that classic \"on high alert\" phrase with a threat word nearby.\n\nLet's break it down. I see the verb \"blocking.\" Hmm, not really the kind of potent verb Q2's looking for. It's more about the action, not the impactful description of the event's effects. Then there's \"affected.\" That's a pretty neutral adjective, not a high-octane verb or part of a striking phrase. No metaphors, no \"on high alert,\" and definitely no superlative-negative combo.\n\nSo, based on that, Q2's a definite \"no\" for me. It doesn't trigger any of the criteria. I'll provide the JSON for Q2.\n"}
