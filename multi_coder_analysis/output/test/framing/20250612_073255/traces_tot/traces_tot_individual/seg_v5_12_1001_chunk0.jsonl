{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'highly pathogenic avian flu viruses' uses 'highly pathogenic' as part of the technical name for the virus, which is excluded from Q1 criteria.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: A Q1 Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment and need to assess it against the first question of the 12-step decision tree. Specifically, I'm checking for any intensifiers, comparatives, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\" modifying risk-related adjectives.  My expert eye immediately scans for those patterns.\n\nThe segment says, *\"There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses...* and then gives a worldwide statistic.  The key phrase is \"highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\"  Now, I immediately recognize that \"highly pathogenic\" is part of the formal, technical designation, almost a scientific naming convention, of that virus.  The rules are *very* clear: if \"highly pathogenic\" is used as part of the formal name (like HPAI), it's a technical term and is *ignored* for the purposes of Q1 unless there are further alarmist cues.\n\nSo, while the segment *does* mention deaths, it does so through a factual statistic. There are no other intensifiers like \"very\" or comparatives like \"more\" modifying any risk-related adjectives. There's also no appearance of the fixed idiom. The use of \"highly pathogenic\" is purely technical in this context, effectively making it a non-issue as far as Q1 is concerned.\n\nTherefore, my answer is \"no\". This segment does not trigger Q1.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment provides factual statistics ('864 people have contracted', 'resulting in 456 deaths') without using high-potency verbs, metaphors, or other Q2 cues.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: Absence of Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses, but worldwide, 864 people have contracted it [highly pathogenic avian flu viruses] since 2003, resulting in 456 deaths, according to the CDC and WHO.\" My task is to evaluate this against Q2 of the decision tree. I know Q2 looks for those \"red flag\" words and phrases: high-potency verbs, impactful metaphors, superlative-negative noun combinations, and the \"on high alert\" phrase. I'm focusing on the alarmist indicators.\n\nLet's break it down. I quickly scanned for my listed high-potency verbs – things like \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" and \"skyrocketed\" – but found none. \"Contracting\" is certainly not a high-potency verb, nor is \"resulting in.\" I noted the technical term \"highly pathogenic avian flu viruses,\" but I'm trained to ignore that as this is technical information and not an indicator of the language pattern I'm looking for.\n\nI checked for the potent metaphors – \"ticking time-bomb,\" \"raging inferno,\" and so on – but they were absent. Similarly, I didn't see any superlative-negative noun pairings like \"worst disaster\" or \"record outbreak.\" And of course, there was no \"on high alert\" or similar alarmist phrase. While \"deaths\" *is* an impact noun, it's not coupled with a high-potency verb, so doesn't trigger a red flag.\n\nTherefore, after a thorough examination of the segment, the answer to Q2 is definitely \"no.\" No indicators of alarmist framing were present. I'm ready to move on to the next question in the decision tree, but for this specific analysis, my task is complete.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'contracted' and 'resulting' which are not the specified moderate verbs for Q3, despite mentioning numbers.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Assessing for Moderate Verbs and Scale**\n\nOkay, I'm analyzing this text snippet against Q3 of the decision tree. The goal is to see if it links a \"moderate verb\" with explicit scale or impact information.  The text reads: \"There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses, but worldwide, 864 people have contracted it [highly pathogenic avian flu viruses] since 2003, resulting in 456 deaths, according to the CDC and WHO.\"\n\nI'm specifically looking for verbs like `hit`, `swept`, `surged`, etc., combined with numerical data that represents impact.  I've scanned the text, and I see the verbs \"contracted\" and \"resulting.\" Neither of these verbs are on the list of \"moderate verbs\" that Q3 specifies.  While the text *does* have scale information - \"864 people,\" and \"456 deaths\" - the verbs are not the ones I'm looking for. They're not \"moderate\" in the sense defined by Q3.  Therefore, I've got to answer \"no\" because the required pattern – a *moderate* verb paired with scale – is simply not present here.\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no questions, rhetorical or otherwise.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text's Rhetorical Tone**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with a text snippet and my task is to determine if it uses a loaded rhetorical question intended to provoke alarm, as per the rules of Q4. I need to be on the lookout for phrases like \"should we be worried?\" or \"is this a crisis?\" - anything that uses emotionally charged language to steer the reader toward a specific conclusion.\n\nI meticulously reviewed the segment: \"There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses, but worldwide, 864 people have contracted it [highly pathogenic avian flu viruses] since 2003, resulting in 456 deaths, according to the CDC and WHO.\"\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the text, I can confidently say that it does not contain a single question, rhetorical or otherwise. It presents straightforward facts about global and US instances of the virus. There is no loaded language intended to elicit a specific emotional response.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the answer to Q4 is \"no\". This snippet is purely factual, offering data without injecting alarmist undertones.\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports the absence of US cases, which is a positive fact, but lacks explicit calming language or reassurance cues from the author or source.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Reassuring Cues: A Q5 Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses, but worldwide, 864 people have contracted it [highly pathogenic avian flu viruses] since 2003, resulting in 456 deaths, according to the CDC and WHO.\" My task is to evaluate this against Q5 of the decision tree: Does this segment contain an *explicit* calming cue?\n\nMy initial thought is to scan for those telltale phrases – \"no cause for alarm,\" \"safe to eat,\" \"risk is very low\" – the kinds of things officials use to reassure the public. Right away, I see the positive statement: \"There is no record of Americans contracting...\" That's a good start, a verifiable piece of data. But the rest of the segment reports global cases and deaths, neutral facts reported, but they are negative facts as a whole, they add to the neutral report.\n\nNow, reviewing the pattern table, \"no record of Americans contracting...\" is akin to \"no cases reported.\" According to Q5, this is a \"Bare Positive Fact.\" I know that in order for this \"Bare Positive Fact\" to be \"Yes\", it requires an explicit calming cue, and that the \"Bare Positive Fact\" is \"Neutral\" by default if it is alone. There's no \"public can rest easy\" or \"this means Americans are safe.\" No positive spin, no \"excellent news\" type amplification to ease concerns. It's just a statement of fact: historical data reported.\n\nThe rest of the segment, detailing global cases and deaths, is equally neutral, just presenting data without context from Q5 of the pattern table.\n\nSo, while there's a positive fact presented, it's not being *framed* in a reassuring way. There's no explicit attempt to calm fears. Therefore, my answer to Q5 is definitely **no**. I'd move on to Q6, but for now, the prompt just wants this answer.\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment provides numbers (864 cases, 456 deaths) but does not use a minimiser word ('only', 'just', 'merely', 'a single', 'few') in conjunction with a scale contrast.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q6 Evaluation: Assessing for a Reassuring Frame**\n\nOkay, I'm at Q6. The task is to determine if the provided text utilizes a \"Reassuring Frame\" – specifically, the presence of a minimiser word paired with a scale contrast. I need to be on the lookout for phrases like \"only a few\" or \"just a fraction\" *followed by* a comparative scale, such as \"among millions\" or \"out of thousands.\"\n\nLooking at the segment: \"There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses, but worldwide, 864 people have contracted it... since 2003, resulting in 456 deaths...\" I'm immediately drawn to the factual statements. No US cases is Q7 territory. Worldwide numbers are presented.\n\nI need a minimizer, that's the key.  While the sentence provides numbers (864 cases, 456 deaths) and a time reference (since 2003), there's no attempt to minimize those numbers with words like \"only\" or \"just.\"  And crucially, there's no scaling against a broader population.  No \"864 out of billions\" or similar scaling contrast.\n\nTherefore, the structure of the text doesn't match the Q6 pattern.  It's simply presenting data.  So, the answer to Q6 is definitively \"no.\" Now, on to the next question.\n"}
