If a direct quote contains a strong alarm cue (extremely concerning, requires immediate action …) **or** strong reassuring cue (no cause for alarm, excellent news …) and it dominates the sentence.

Ex Alarmist → "Professor: '**extremely concerning** and requires immediate action.'"
Ex Reassuring → "Minister: '**no cause for alarm**.'"
