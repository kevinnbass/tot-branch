These errors [in genome copying] don't always work in favor of the virus. Most of the time, viruses with errors [in genome copying] won't work or be fit enough to continue to copy and survive. But every once in a while, a random error [in genome copying] can result in a change to the virus that gives it an advantage in its environment, and that version of the virus will continue to spread and grow.", "article_id": 647}
