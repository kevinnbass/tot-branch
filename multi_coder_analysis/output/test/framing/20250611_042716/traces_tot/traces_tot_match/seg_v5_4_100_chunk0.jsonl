{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'so' modifying the risk-adjective 'infectious'.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis and Framing Determination**\n\nAs a seasoned claim-framing coder, I've meticulously applied the Q1 decision tree to each text segment. The task was to identify the presence of an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\" My analysis was guided by the provided rules, definitions, and the specific regex pattern. The technical-term guard for \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\" and the \"Base Risk-Adj (alone)\" clarification in the detailed instructions were critical in accurately classifying each segment.\n\nHere's the detailed breakdown of my findings:\n\n*   **Segments 1-7, 9-11, 13-27, 29-30:**  Upon a thorough examination, these segments did not contain the specific alarmist cue addressed by Q1. They didn't feature an intensifier/comparative modifying a risk-adjective or the specified idiom. Some segments contained factual information, quantitative data, or technical terms; in other cases, they contained reassurances, but none met the criteria for an \"Alarmist\" frame based on Q1.\n\n*   **Segment 8:** This segment contains \"very low\", which is a reassuring phrase rather than an amplifier of a negative risk adjective, and this phrase does not meet the Q1 requirement.\n\n*   **Segment 28:** This segment, however, triggered the Q1 criteria. The phrase \"so infectious\" clearly indicates an intensifier modifying a risk-adjective (\"infectious\"). This directly met the Q1 rule's conditions for an \"Alarmist\" frame.\n\nTherefore, the output should be as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 1,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier/comparative modifies a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 2,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Technical-term guard in place.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 3,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Describes an outcome/scale of deaths, not modified risk-adj.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 4,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Quantifies an action, doesn't intensify risk-adj.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 5,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\\\"affected\\\" is not a risk-adjective in the Q1 sense.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 6,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\\\"Deadly\\\" is a base risk adjective, not intensified.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 7,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"None of the cue/risk adjective phrases apply.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 8,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\\\"very low\\\" is a reassurance (Q4), not alarmist.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 9,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\\\"deadly\\\" is alone; background information is ignored.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 10,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Describes outcome, not modified risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 11,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Action (culled), not intensified risk-adj.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 12,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Bare negation, risk-level statement.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 13,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Verb (spreading), factual count.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 14,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Factual production information.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 15,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Factual information.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 16,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Factual information.\"\n  },\n  {"}
