The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)\n\n**Clarification on \"deadly,\" \"fatal,\" \"lethal\":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, \"deadly\" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.\n\n**Minimal Pair Examples:**\n* **Neutral:** \"The virus is contagious.\"\n* **Alarmist (Author):** \"The virus is frighteningly contagious, spreading like wildfire.\" (Cue: 'frighteningly,' 'spreading like wildfire').\n\n**New Comparative Minimal Pair Example:**\n* **Alarmist:** \"Scientists warn the virus is becoming deadlier each season.\"\n* **Neutral:** \"Scientists track how the virus becomes more common each season.\"\n\n**⚠ TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  \nA term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. \"lethal dose 50\").  \n**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – Intensifier + adjective** | \"The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.\" | **Alarmist** | \"so deadly\" (intensifier + risk adjective) |\n| **Alarmist – Deadly-from-outset idiom** | \"H5N1 is deadly from the start, vets warn.\" | **Alarmist** | \"deadly from the start\" (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom) |\n\n**Regex Pattern  (v2.16.2):**\n```regex\n # Ignore the fixed scientific term \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\"\n \\b(?:(?:highly(?!\\s+pathogenic\\s+avian(?:\\s+flu|\\s+influenza)?))\n     |very|deadlier|more|extremely|severely|so|particularly|frighteningly)  \n     (?:\\s+\\w+){0,3}\\s+\n # Risk-adj list (adding infectious, transmissible) while pruning ECON adjective \"volatile\"\n (deadly|lethal|dangerous|severe|catastrophic|brutal|contagious|virulent|destructive|infectious|transmissible)\\b|\n # NEW (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom)\n \\bdeadly\\s+from\\s+(?:the\\s+)?(?:start|outset)\\b\n```\n\n**EXCLUSION — \"volatile\"**  \nWhen \"volatile\" modifies *prices/markets/rates* it is treated as an **economic metric** (see Q9) and never triggers Q1.\n\n> **Technical-term guard** – \"highly pathogenic\" used as part of the formal\n> disease name (HPAI) is **Neutral** unless further alarmist cues appear.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` \nYou will answer the **same question** (Q1) for EACH segment listed below.\nRespond with **one JSON array**.

(ID: seg_v5_11_1005_chunk0)\nThe outbreaks were deemed the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history, costing the government nearly $1 billion for removal and disposal of infected birds and government indemnity payments to producers for the lost birds.\n\n### Segment 59 (ID: seg_v5_12_1005_chunk0)\nThe strain now circulating is H5N1 and is related to the 2015 virus.\n\n### Segment 60 (ID: seg_v5_13_1005_chunk0)\nIt [H5N1] has been circulating for months in Europe and Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the U.S. case was identified.\n\n### Segment 61 (ID: seg_v5_14_1005_chunk0)\nMigratory wild birds often carry strains of avian influenza and they’re often low pathogenic, which means they don’t kill the birds.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_15_1005_chunk0)\nSometimes those strains [of avian influenza] can get into domestic flocks and mutate into more deadly viruses.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_16_1005_chunk0)\nThe H5N1 now spreading from wild birds is already highly pathogenic, which means it is deadly from the start, said Dr. Yuko Sato, a veterinarian and assistant professor in the Department of Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal Medicine at Iowa State University.\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_17_1005_chunk0)\nU.S. surveillance efforts have identified the virus [H5N1] in wild birds in recent weeks in New Hampshire, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and South Carolina, making it [H5N1] apparent that it [H5N1] is in the environment broadly.\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_18_1005_chunk0)\nThe virus [H5N1] spreads easily from wild bird droppings and can be carried into commercial flocks on the feet of workers or on equipment, which is why high-level biosecurity protocol has been activated across the country in commercial operations.\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_19_1005_chunk0)\nThey [commercial operations]’ve enacted new safeguards to prevent deadly bird flu infections, often referred to as HPAI, and isolate them [deadly bird flu infections] when they [deadly bird flu infections] occur.\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_20_1005_chunk0)\n“With the increased preparatory efforts USDA and its partners have put into place since the 2015 HPAI outbreak, we are fully prepared to handle this detection,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA, which deals with outbreaks on U.S.\n\n### Segment 68 (ID: seg_v5_1_1001_chunk0)\nAvian flu has now been detected in flocks of birds in Virginia and Kentucky, just days after Indiana officials had to euthanize 29,000 turkeys due to the spread of the virus [avian flu], the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Monday.\n\n### Segment 69 (ID: seg_v5_2_1001_chunk0)\nDozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\n\n### Segment 70 (ID: seg_v5_3_1001_chunk0)\nAvian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\n\n### Segment 71 (ID: seg_v5_4_1001_chunk0)\nBirds at a commercial turkey farm in Southern Indiana contracted the virus [avian flu] last week, forcing officials to cull 29,000 turkeys in an attempt to stop the spread.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_5_1001_chunk0)\nA backyard flock of mixed birds in Virginia had to be culled after they [the backyard flock] tested positive for avian flu.\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_6_1001_chunk0)\nOfficials are also working to depopulate a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, that tested positive for the flu [avian flu].\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_7_1001_chunk0)\nTest results are still pending for a separate flock in Webster County.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_8_1001_chunk0)\nThe culled birds will not enter the food system at a time when the agricultural industry is already being challenged by rising inflation and supply chain issues.\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_9_1001_chunk0)\nThe price index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs saw the largest increase among all food groups last month, rising 12.2% over January of last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_10_1001_chunk0)\nPoultry farms in Africa, Europe, and Asia are also dealing with avian flu.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_1_10_chunk0)\nMore than 35,000 chickens are to be culled at a Dutch farm after a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu was discovered there, the agriculture ministry announced Thursday.\n\n### Segment 79 (ID: seg_v5_2_10_chunk0)\nThe outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\n\n### Segment 80 (ID: seg_v5_3_10_chunk0)\nThe government did not immediately report the exact strain of bird flu that infected chickens on the farm.\n\n### Segment 81 (ID: seg_v5_4_10_chunk0)\nThe agriculture ministry tightened controls Thursday around the infected farm in the village of Altforst, 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the capital, Amsterdam.\n\n### Segment 82 (ID: seg_v5_5_10_chunk0)\nAnother 34 farms are situated within a 10-kilometer (6 mile) radius of the infected location.\n\n### Segment 83 (ID: seg_v5_6_10_chunk0)\nAuthorities banned the transport of any birds, eggs, manure, used straw and other animal products from the 10-kilometer ring around the infected farm.\n\n### Segment 84 (ID: seg_v5_1_1005_chunk0)\nFarms that raise turkeys and chickens for meat and eggs are on high alert and taking steps to increase biosecurity, fearing a repeat of a widespread bird flu outbreak in 2015 that killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion.\n\n### Segment 85 (ID: seg_v5_2_1005_chunk0)\nThe new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 86 (ID: seg_v5_3_1005_chunk0)\nThe 29,000 turkeys in the flock were killed to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 87 (ID: seg_v5_4_1005_chunk0)\nThe poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry.\n\n### Segment 88 (ID: seg_v5_5_1005_chunk0)\nEgg, turkey and chicken prices could rise and availability could drop if birds at enough farms were to be infected.\n\n### Segment 89 (ID: seg_v5_6_1005_chunk0)\n“It’s definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry,” said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association.\n\n### Segment 90 (ID: seg_v5_7_1005_chunk0)\n“I feel positive that we can tackle this situation better and I have my fingers crossed that this will be an isolated case, however, I would hope for the best and be prepared for the worst.”\n\n### Segment 91 (ID: seg_v5_8_1005_chunk0)\nHealth officials say no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S. and the disease doesn’t present an immediate public health concern.\n\n### Segment 92 (ID: seg_v5_9_1005_chunk0)\nThe 2015 outbreak led producers to kill 33 million egg-laying hens in Iowa, the nation’s leading egg producer, and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation’s leading turkey producer, with smaller outbreaks in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\n### Segment 93 (ID: seg_v5_10_1005_chunk0)\nThe disease caused egg and turkey prices across the country to soar for months, with the cost of eggs up 61 percent at one point and prices for boneless, skinless turkey breasts rising 75 percent between May and July 2015.\n\n### Segment 94 (ID: seg_v5_1_1004_chunk0)\nU.S. poultry producers are on high alert after cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have cropped up in multiple states, sparking fears that further outbreaks could cause significant losses.\n\n### Segment 95 (ID: seg_v5_2_1004_chunk0)\nThe United States Department of Agriculture confirmed Feb. 9 that a commercial turkey flock in Indiana was hit with avian flu, the first case in the U.S. since 2020.\n\n### Segment 96 (ID: seg_v5_3_1004_chunk0)\nThe entire flock of nearly 30,000 birds was euthanized in an effort to stop the spread.\n\n### Segment 97 (ID: seg_v5_4_1004_chunk0)\nThen on Feb. 14, the agency confirmed that a commercial flock of broiler chickens was hit with bird flu in Kentucky, and a backyard flock of mixed species fowl also tested positive in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 98 (ID: seg_v5_5_1004_chunk0)\nBoth flocks were culled.\n\n### Segment 99 (ID: seg_v5_6_1004_chunk0)\nTom Super, senior vice president of the National Chicken Council, told FOX Business that while any detection of bird flu in poultry is a concern and the industry remains on high alert, the U.S. has the most robust monitoring and surveillance program in the world and detailed plans are in place to control spreading among flocks and eliminate the virus completely.\n\n### Segment 100 (ID: seg_v5_7_1004_chunk0)\nNational Turkey Federation Vice President of Communications Beth Breeding told FOX Business that producers are focused on farm security every day and that members remain vigilant and practice all biosecurity protocols.\n\n### Segment 101 (ID: seg_v5_8_1004_chunk0)\nShe [Beth Breeding] said that for farms within a 10km control zone of confirmed bird flu cases, regular testing is taking place to monitor the health of flocks.\n\n### Segment 102 (ID: seg_v5_9_1004_chunk0)\nA spokesperson from the USDA told FOX Business that the agency recently expanded its wild bird surveillance after the first detection of HPAI in a wild bird in the U.S., and that the surveillance of wild birds ensures that both the agency and the poultry industry are able to enhance biosecurity measures and rapidly respond to reduce the risk of disease spread.\n\n### Segment 103 (ID: seg_v5_10_1004_chunk0)\nThe spokesperson said that bird owners (whether it’s commercial or backyard poultry, or pet or hobby birds), should take some simple steps to protect their birds from the virus:\n\n### Segment 104 (ID: seg_v5_11_1006_chunk0)\nCertain strains of avian flu are highly transmissible between flocks, which are then euthanized to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 105 (ID: seg_v5_12_1006_chunk0)\nThe virus is spread by migratory birds and waterfowl, usually this time of year.\n\n### Segment 106 (ID: seg_v5_13_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods is prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing,' the company said in an emailed statement.\n\n### Segment 107 (ID: seg_v5_14_1006_chunk0)\nPlans include additional restrictions on access to farms and continuing to test each flock for avian influenza before it is processed.\n\n### Segment 108 (ID: seg_v5_15_1006_chunk0)\nFarms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\n\n### Segment 109 (ID: seg_v5_16_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\n\n### Segment 110 (ID: seg_v5_21_1005_chunk0)\nFederal and state officials are working with the poultry industry and have initiated steps such as an immediate quarantine that restricts movement of poultry and equipment used to move birds in and out of specified perimeters around an infected barn usually around 6 miles initially and eradication of the virus by killing and removing birds at the infection site.\n\n### Segment 111 (ID: seg_v5_22_1005_chunk0)\nTesting occurs in the quarantine area of both wild and domestic birds.\n\n### Segment 112 (ID: seg_v5_23_1005_chunk0)\nDisinfection is done to kill the virus [H5N1] at the affected farm and testing is used to confirm it’s free of the virus [H5N1].\n\n### Segment 113 (ID: seg_v5_24_1005_chunk0)\nProducers who want to ensure eligibility for government indemnity payments in case of disaster must have a biosecurity protocol on hand that is updated regularly.\n\n### Segment 114 (ID: seg_v5_25_1005_chunk0)\nTo help with that [ensuring eligibility for government indemnity payments/having a biosecurity protocol], the USDA has developed a 14-point biosecurity plan for producers, which is audited yearly and reviewed every two years by state agriculture agencies, Sato said.\n\n### Segment 115 (ID: seg_v5_26_1005_chunk0)\nIn Iowa, a state with 49 million chickens,

Council.\n\n### Segment 116 (ID: seg_v5_27_1005_chunk0)\n“IPA is maintaining open communications specifically related to biosecurity best practices and is offering surveillance testing.\n\n### Segment 117 (ID: seg_v5_28_1005_chunk0)\nWe [IPA] are confident in our producers preparedness and ability to manage their flocks,” he [Kevin Stiles] said.\n\n### Segment 118 (ID: seg_v5_21_1007_chunk0)\nThe U.S. was forecast to export 3.4 million tons of chicken meat in 2022, of total global export of 13.4 million tons.\n\n### Segment 119 (ID: seg_v5_22_1007_chunk0)\nThe growth in U.S. chicken meat export is partially due to the downturn in exports of chicken meat from the European Union which was caused by avian flu.\n\n### Segment 120 (ID: seg_v5_23_1007_chunk0)\nThe USDA says as part of avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working together to provide additional surveillance and testing in regions surrounding where the affected flocks are located.\n\n### Segment 121 (ID: seg_v5_24_1007_chunk0)\nThey [federal and state partners] add that anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyards up to the large commercial producers should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds.\n\n### Segment 122 (ID: seg_v5_25_1007_chunk0)\nThe Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS) is offering a biosecurity tool kit for poultry producers and a list of cases can be found on its website.\n\n### Segment 123 (ID: seg_v5_26_1007_chunk0)\nThe site currently lists three cases in commercial birds during the current outbreak.\n\n### Segment 124 (ID: seg_v5_27_1007_chunk0)\nThis [list of cases] includes commercial turkeys, a mixed-species backyard flock in Fauquier County, Virginia, and the broiler chicken flock in Fulton County, Kentucky, belonging to Tyson foods.\n\n### Segment 125 (ID: seg_v5_28_1007_chunk0)\nThis article and its headline were updated to clarify a barn of chickens among a flock of 240,000 birds was infected with bird flu.\n\n### Segment 126 (ID: seg_v5_1_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 127 (ID: seg_v5_2_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA also said HPAI was found in a backyard flock in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 128 (ID: seg_v5_3_1006_chunk0)\nLast week, the presence of HPAI was found in a commercial turkey flock of 30,000 in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 129 (ID: seg_v5_4_1006_chunk0)\nIf the disease spreads to enough farms in a geographic region, it could impact the production of chicken, turkey and eggs, raising consumer prices and impacting exports.\n\n### Segment 130 (ID: seg_v5_5_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods said it does not expect the case in Kentucky to impact its overall production.\n\n### Segment 131 (ID: seg_v5_6_1006_chunk0)\nIn 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\n\n### Segment 132 (ID: seg_v5_7_1006_chunk0)\nThough broiler chickens weren't heavily infected, exports dropped by $1.1 billion, or 26%.\n\n### Segment 133 (ID: seg_v5_8_1006_chunk0)\nEgg exports dropped 13% and turkey 23%.\n\n### Segment 134 (ID: seg_v5_9_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA estimated the cost to the federal government was more than $1 billion $879 million to manage the crisis and about $200 million in indemnities for lost birds.\n\n### Segment 135 (ID: seg_v5_10_1006_chunk0)\nThe USDA says avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and that no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.\n\n### Segment 136 (ID: seg_v5_1_1007_chunk0)\nChickens in one barn among a flock of 240,000 birds belonging to Tyson Foods have become infected with a lethal form of bird flu, the company confirmed.\n\n### Segment 137 (ID: seg_v5_2_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery intensifies an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. that involves poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia, and follows the destruction of 29,000 turkeys in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 138 (ID: seg_v5_3_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.\n\n### Segment 139 (ID: seg_v5_4_1007_chunk0)\nThe governmental department added that avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern as a human case of these avian flu viruses has yet to be detected in the U.S.\n\n### Segment 140 (ID: seg_v5_5_1007_chunk0)\nA spokesperson for Tyson Foods told Newsweek one barn among a flock of 240,000 in Kentucky had chickens that tested positive for bird flu.\n\n### Segment 141 (ID: seg_v5_6_1007_chunk0)\nTyson Foods said in a statement to Newsweek: 'We are actively working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.'\n\n### Segment 142 (ID: seg_v5_7_1007_chunk0)\nAlthough the origin of the infection is not known, avian influenza has been found in migratory wild birds, which play a significant role in spreading the disease.'\n\n### Segment 143 (ID: seg_v5_8_1007_chunk0)\nWe are 'prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing,' it [Tyson Foods] added, including 'heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, placing additional restrictions on outside visitors, and continuing our practice of testing all flocks for avian influenza before birds leave the farms.'\n\n### Segment 144 (ID: seg_v5_9_1007_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 700 cases of bird flu in humans have been recorded globally since November 2003.\n\n### Segment 145 (ID: seg_v5_10_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC says that though bird flu can cross species and infect humans, this cross-transmission [bird flu crossing species and infecting humans] is rare.\n\n### Segment 146 (ID: seg_v5_11_1007_chunk0)\nInfection usually occurs as a result of infected birds shedding avian virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces which then gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled.\n\n### Segment 147 (ID: seg_v5_12_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC adds that this [infection via shedding/contact] can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or even possibly dust and a person breathes it [the virus] in, or when a person touches something that has the virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.\n\n### Segment 148 (ID: seg_v5_13_1007_chunk0)\nCross infection also usually occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses.\n\n### Segment 149 (ID: seg_v5_14_1007_chunk0)\nBut, the CDC reports some infections have been identified where direct contact was not known to have occurred.\n\n### Segment 150 (ID: seg_v5_15_1007_chunk0)\nWhen a person is infected with avian flu the resultant illness ranges from mild to severe.\n\n### Segment 151 (ID: seg_v5_16_1007_chunk0)\nIn January, Newsweek reported on a rare case of avian flu crossing over to a human in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Segment 152 (ID: seg_v5_17_1007_chunk0)\nThe U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said at the time that the person in question, who lived in southwest England, had been in close contact with infected birds and there was no evidence of onward transmission.\n\n### Segment 153 (ID: seg_v5_18_1007_chunk0)\nIn addition to avoiding unprotected close contact with birds, the USDA advises that to further offset the risk of cross-transmission of avian flu to humans, poultry and eggs should be cooked to an internal of 165F to kill bacteria and viruses.\n\n### Segment 154 (ID: seg_v5_19_1007_chunk0)\nThese infections [human infections] are concerning for non-health-related reasons, however, especially if more poultry operations in the country are found to be affected.\n\n### Segment 155 (ID: seg_v5_20_1007_chunk0)\nAccording to the USDA, the U.S. is the world's top producer of poultry, and number two in terms of exports, following the top exporter Brazil.\n\n### Segment 156 (ID: seg_v5_11_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this month, a strain of avian flu was confirmed at a commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana.\n\n### Segment 157 (ID: seg_v5_12_1008_chunk0)\nBIRD FLU OUTBREAKS PUT US POULTRY FARMS ON HIGH ALERT\n\n### Segment 158 (ID: seg_v5_13_1008_chunk0)\nThe agency [USDA] said the \"birds from the flocks will not enter the food system.\"\n\n### Segment 159 (ID: seg_v5_14_1008_chunk0)\nThese avian influenza detections [of avian influenza] do not \"present an immediate public health concern,\" the USDA added, citing data from U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n### Segment 160 (ID: seg_v5_15_1008_chunk0)\nThe agency [USDA] is also reminding consumers that properly prepared and cooked poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees kills bacteria and viruses.\n\n### Segment 161 (ID: seg_v5_16_1008_chunk0)\nTyson said its chicken products remain safe for consumers, and it is working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 162 (ID: seg_v5_17_1008_chunk0)\nTo mitigate the spread [of the virus], Tyson is \"heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region and placing additional restrictions on outside visitors and continuing our practice of testing all flocks for avian influenza before birds leave the farms.\"\n\n### Segment 163 (ID: seg_v5_18_1008_chunk0)\nThe company [Tyson] said the incident within one of its farms is not expected to impact production levels.\n\n### Segment 164 (ID: seg_v5_52_101_chunk0)\nMethods include spraying chickens and turkeys with a foam that causes asphyxiation.\n\n### Segment 165 (ID: seg_v5_53_101_chunk0)\nIn other cases, carbon dioxide is used to kill the birds, whose carcasses are often composted or placed in a landfill.\n\n### Segment 166 (ID: seg_v5_54_101_chunk0)\nIt's [culling] arguably more humane than letting them [birds] die from the virus,' Professor Kean said.\n\n### Segment 167 (ID: seg_v5_55_101_chunk0)\nAvian influenza was discovered at Cold Spring Egg Farm in Palmyra, Wis., forcing the commercial egg producer to destroy nearly three million chickens in March.\n\n### Segment 168 (ID: seg_v5_11_1009_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 169 (ID: seg_v5_12_1009_chunk0)\nThey [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky’s first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\n\n### Segment 170 (ID: seg_v5_13_1009_chunk0)\nIn a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 171 (ID: seg_v5_14_1009_chunk0)\nHuman infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they're considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\n\n### Segment 172 (ID: seg_v5_15_1009_chunk0)\nNo Americans are recorded to have contracted highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\n\n### Segment 173 (ID: seg_v5_16_1009_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 174 (ID: seg_v5_1_1008_chunk0)\nTyson Foods says it's ramping up biosecurity measures at its farms after a flock of chicken in Kentucky tested positive for the bird flu.\n\n### Segment 175 (ID: seg_v5_2_1008_chunk0)\nTo date, the company is only aware of one affected house at a farm in Fulton County, Kentucky, which is one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for the company.\n\n### Segment 176 (ID: seg_v5_3_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this week, the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed the presence of bird flu in Kentucky and Virginia, reigniting fears of another widespread bird flu outbreak.\n\n### Segment 177 (ID: seg_v5_4_1008_chunk0)\nBird flu can cause high mortality rates among birds.\n\n### Segment 178 (ID: seg_v5_5_1008_chunk0)\nIn 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\n\n### Segment 179 (ID: seg_v5_6_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA said it detected the presence of the virus in an undisclosed number of birds from a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 180 (ID: seg_v5_7_1008_chunk0)\nThe agency [USDA] said Monday that \"birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease\" and that \"depopulation is complete in Virginia.\"\n\n### Segment 181 (ID: seg_v5_8_1008_chunk0)\nTyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 182 (ID: seg_v5_9_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA is awaiting results of a potential second case about 124 miles northeast in Webster County, Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 183 (ID: seg_v5_10_1008_chunk0)\nMeanwhile, a backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also tested positive for the virus.\n\n### Segment 184 (ID: seg_v5_1_1009_chunk0)\nA \"highly pathogenic\" form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\n### Segment 185 (ID: seg_v5_2_1009_chunk0)\nThe virus was detected in a small, non-commercial backyard block that was not being used for poultry purposes, the agency [USDA] said.\n\n### Segment 186 (ID: seg_v5_3_1009_chunk0)\nThe USDA said it is now \"working closely with state animal health officials in New York on a joint incident response,\" according to the statement.\n\n### Segment 187 (ID: seg_v5_4_1009_chunk0)\n\"State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n### Segment 188 (ID: seg_v5_5_1009_chunk0)\nBirds from the flock will not enter the food system.\"\n\n### Segment 189 (ID: seg_v5_6_1009_chunk0)\nNo human cases of avian influenza have been detected in the United States.\n\n### Segment 190 (ID: seg_v5_7_1009_chunk0)\nRecent detections of the virus [H5N1] in other states in February do not present an immediate health concern, the agency [USDA] said.\n\n### Segment 191 (ID: seg_v5_8_1009_chunk0)\n\"As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F kills bacteria and viruses,\" the USDA release on Saturday said.\n\n### Segment 192 (ID: seg_v5_9_1009_chunk0)\n\"As part of existing avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock.\"\n\n### Segment 193 (ID: seg_v5_10_1009_chunk0)\nIt [the detection in New York] came after the virus was discovered in flocks of birds in Kentucky, Virginia, and Indiana.\n\n### Segment 194 (ID: seg_v5_1_1000_chunk0)\nHealth officials announced Monday that they detected a highly contagious strain of bird flu in two additional U.S. states, furthering a threat to the country's poultry industry.\n\n### Segment 195 (ID: seg_v5_2_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\n\n### Segment 196 (ID: seg_v5_3_1000_chunk0)\nThe latest outbreaks were reported just days after the U.S. ordered nearly 30,000 turkeys to be euthanized in Indiana after testing positive for the same H5N1 strain of the highly pathogenic disease.\n\n### Segment 197 (ID: seg_v5_4_1000_chunk0)\nThe latest outbreaks were reported just days after the U.S. ordered nearly 30,000 turkeys to be euthanized in Indiana after testing positive for the same H5N1 strain of the highly pathogenic disease. That outbreak [in Indiana] was the first case of bird flu found among a commercial poultry flock since 2020.\n\n### Segment 198 (ID: seg_v5_5_1000_chunk0)\nAPHIS said Monday that the birds in the most recently infected flocks will also be quarantined and killed off, and that so far no human cases of the virus have been detected in the U.S.\n\n### Segment 199 (ID: seg_v5_6_1000_chunk0)\nBirds from the flocks will not enter the food system,' APHIS said in a statement on Monday.\n\n### Segment 200 (ID: seg_v5_7_1000_chunk0)\nBirds from the flocks will not enter the food system,' APHIS said in a statement on Monday. 'The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations,' it [APHIS] added.\n\n### Segment 201 (ID: seg_v5_8_1000_chunk0)\nThe United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations,' it [APHIS] added. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added Monday that these virus detections [of bird flu] do not present an immediate public health concern.\n\n### Segment 202 (ID: seg_v5_9_1000_chunk0)\nAuthorities believe wild birds have been spreading the virus, after dozens recently tested positive for the flu along the East Coast, Reuters reported.\n\n### Segment 203 (ID: seg_v5_10_1000_chunk0)\nAPHIS urged Americans involved with poultry production from small-scale backyard operations to large commercial environments to review their biosecurity activities and prevent contact between their birds and wild bird populations.\n\n### Segment 204 (ID: seg_v5_11_101_chunk0)\nIt's [getting this virus] not impossible for humans to get this virus, but it's [getting this virus] been pretty rare,' Professor Kean said.\n\n### Segment 205 (ID: seg_v5_12_101_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it [CDC] had been monitoring people in the United States who were exposed to infected poultry and other birds.\n\n### Segment 206 (ID: seg_v5_13_101_chunk0)\nSo far, no cases of H5N1 infection have been found among them, the C.D.C. said.\n\n### Segment 207 (ID: seg_v5_14_101_chunk0)\nYes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has said that properly prepared and cooked poultry and eggs should not pose a risk to consumers.\n\n### Segment 208 (ID: seg_v5_15_101_chunk0)\nThe chance of infected poultry entering the food chain is 'extremely low,' the agency [USDA] has said.\n\n### Segment 209 (ID: seg_v5_16_101_chunk0)\nUnder federal guidelines, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, part of the U.S.D.A., is responsible for inspecting all poultry sold in interstate and foreign commerce.\n\n### Segment 210 (ID: seg_v5_17_101_chunk0)\nInspectors are required to be present at all times during the slaughtering process, according to the service, which noted that the inspectors have unfettered access to those facilities.\n\n### Segment 211 (ID: seg_v5_18_101_chunk0)\nEgg-production facilities that are subject to federal regulation are required to undergo daily inspections once per shift, according to the inspection service.\n\n### Segment 212 (ID: seg_v5_19_101_chunk0)\nState inspection programs, which inspect poultry products sold only within the state they were produced, are additionally monitored by the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 213 (ID: seg_v5_20_101_chunk0)\nBecause of the mandated culling of infected flocks, experts say, the virus is primarily an animal health issue at this time.\n\n### Segment 214 (ID: seg_v5_21_101_chunk0)\nStill, the U.S.D.A. recommends cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 Fahrenheit to reduce the potential for food-borne illness.\n\n### Segment 215 (ID: seg_v5_22_101_chunk0)\nCan I expect to pay more for poultry products?\n\n### Segment 216 (ID: seg_v5_23_101_chunk0)\nEgg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015.\n\n### Segment 217 (ID: seg_v5_24_101_chunk0)\nRecently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 218 (ID: seg_v5_25_101_chunk0)\nIf infections course through more flocks, experts said, there could be some shortages of eggs.\n\n### Segment 219 (ID: seg_v5_26_101_chunk0)\nPrices for white and dark chicken meat were also rising, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 220 (ID: seg_v5_27_101_chunk0)\nExperts also warned that turkey prices could also become more volatile.\n\n### Segment 221 (ID: seg_v5_28_101_chunk0)\nTesting for the avian flu typically involves swabbing the mouths and tracheal area of chickens and turkeys.\n\n### Segment 222 (ID: seg_v5_29_101_chunk0)\nThe samples are sent to diagnostic labs to be analyzed.\n\n### Segment 223 (ID: seg_v5_30_101_chunk0)\nOutbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\n\n### Segment 224 (ID: seg_v5_31_101_chunk0)\nAs of March 31, the highly pathogenic form of the avian flu had been detected in 19 states, a tracking page maintained by the U.S.D.A. showed.\n\n### Segment 225 (ID: seg_v5_32_101_chunk0)\nThe combined number of birds in the infected flocks -- the commercial and backyard type -- totaled more than 17 million, according to the agency.\n\n### Segment 226 (ID: seg_v5_33_101_chunk0)\nA spokesman for the U.S.D.A. confirmed that those birds would be required to be euthanized to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 227 (ID: seg_v5_34_101_chunk0)\nAn commercial egg production facility in Buena Vista County, Iowa, constituted the largest infected flock and was made up of more than 5.3 million chickens, the U.S.D.A.

seg_v5_37_101_chunk0)\nHow do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\n\n### Segment 231 (ID: seg_v5_38_101_chunk0)\nThe outbreak in 2014 and 2015 in the United States was blamed for $3 billion in losses to the agricultural sector and was considered to be the most destructive in the nation's history.\n\n### Segment 232 (ID: seg_v5_39_101_chunk0)\nNearly 50 million birds died, either from the virus or from having to be culled, a majority of them in Iowa or Minnesota.\n\n### Segment 233 (ID: seg_v5_40_101_chunk0)\nThe footprint of the current outbreak, extending from the Midwest and Plains to northern New England, has raised concerns.\n\n### Segment 234 (ID: seg_v5_1_101_chunk0)\nMore than 15 million chickens and turkeys from infected commercial and backyard flocks in 19 states have been killed, officials said.\n\n### Segment 235 (ID: seg_v5_2_101_chunk0)\nFrom Wyoming to Maine, an outbreak of the highly contagious bird flu has swept across farms and backyard flocks in the United States this year, prompting millions of chickens and turkeys to be culled.\n\n### Segment 236 (ID: seg_v5_3_101_chunk0)\nIowa has been particularly hard hit, with disasters being declared in some counties and the state canceling live bird exhibits in an order that may affect its famed state fair.\n\n### Segment 237 (ID: seg_v5_4_101_chunk0)\nBetter known as the bird flu, avian influenza is a highly contagious and deadly virus that can prey on chickens, turkeys and wild birds, including ducks and geese.\n\n### Segment 238 (ID: seg_v5_5_101_chunk0)\nIt [Avian influenza] spreads via nasal secretions, saliva and fecal droppings, which experts say makes it [spread] difficult to contain.\n\n### Segment 239 (ID: seg_v5_6_101_chunk0)\nSymptoms of the virus include a sudden increase in the mortality of a flock, a drop in egg production and diminished consumption of feed and water.\n\n### Segment 240 (ID: seg_v5_7_101_chunk0)\nThe virus, Eurasian H5N1, is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry.\n\n### Segment 241 (ID: seg_v5_8_101_chunk0)\nIts prevalence in the United States is not unexpected, with outbreaks previously reported in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.\n\n### Segment 242 (ID: seg_v5_9_101_chunk0)\nShould humans be worried about being infected?\n\n### Segment 243 (ID: seg_v5_10_101_chunk0)\nThe risk to humans is very low, said Ron Kean, a faculty associate and extension specialist in the University of Wisconsin at Madison department of animal and dairy sciences.\n\n### Segment 244 (ID: seg_v5_011_1010_chunk0)\nFortunately for consumers, these avian flus [HPAI viruses] are rarely transmissible to humans, and there is no evidence that the virus [H5N1] can spread to humans through the consumption of infected poultry.\n\n### Segment 245 (ID: seg_v5_013_1010_chunk0)\nNo human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses have been detected to date in the United States.'\n\n### Segment 246 (ID: seg_v5_014_1010_chunk0)\nHowever, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\n\n### Segment 247 (ID: seg_v5_015_1010_chunk0)\nNonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak [of H5N1].\n\n### Segment 248 (ID: seg_v5_016_1010_chunk0)\nNonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak. However, these restrictions [on imports] may be short-lived, as the supply chain crunch for poultry is being felt around the globe, and HPAI viruses have sporadically emerged throughout the world in the past two years.\n\n### Segment 249 (ID: seg_v5_41_101_chunk0)\nI think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n### Segment 250 (ID: seg_v5_42_101_chunk0)\nWhat can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\n\n### Segment 251 (ID: seg_v5_43_101_chunk0)\nAs early as last year, the U.S.D.A. warned of the likelihood of an outbreak of the avian flu and emphasized a hardening of 'biosecurity' measures to protect flocks of chickens and turkeys.\n\n### Segment 252 (ID: seg_v5_44_101_chunk0)\nBiosecurity measures include limiting access to the flocks and requiring farm workers to practice strict hygiene measures like wearing disposable boots and coveralls.\n\n### Segment 253 (ID: seg_v5_45_101_chunk0)\nSharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus.\n\n### Segment 254 (ID: seg_v5_46_101_chunk0)\nSo can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting.\n\n### Segment 255 (ID: seg_v5_48_101_chunk0)\nAt this point, every person producing poultry has to be considering how to improve their biosecurity.'\n\n### Segment 256 (ID: seg_v5_49_101_chunk0)\nIs it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys?\n\n### Segment 257 (ID: seg_v5_50_101_chunk0)\nInfected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 258 (ID: seg_v5_51_101_chunk0)\nThe virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\n\n### Segment 259 (ID: seg_v5_001_1010_chunk0)\nCases of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in Indiana, Virginia, and Kentucky, posing a likely threat to the United States' domestic supply of chicken and turkey this winter.\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)\n#  -----------------------------------------------------------\n✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**\n1.

  "thoughts": "**Decision Tree Q1 Application Summary**\n\nAlright, let's break down how I approached this task. I was given a list of 259 text segments and tasked with identifying which ones triggered \"Alarmist\" language according to the Decision Tree's Q1. Q1 is all about spotting intensifiers or comparatives directly modifying risk-adjectives, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\".  My expertise in recognizing these nuanced linguistic patterns was crucial here.\n\nThe core of my approach was a meticulous, line-by-line examination of each segment.  I had a clear mental checklist: Does this segment have an intensifier or comparative?  Does that word directly modify a risk-adjective? Or does it use that specific idiom?  I had to be extremely precise because the instructions included specific exclusions, like recognizing \"highly pathogenic\" as technical jargon. My regex skills were paramount here, though I kept the patterns in mind at all times.\n\nFor each segment, I mentally processed the structure: low-risk adjectives, background information, or explicit reassurances were straight \"no's\". I knew to be very careful with numbers and facts and I immediately filtered for these non-relevant data. I quickly recognized \"reassuring language\" because I've worked extensively with that data type. I applied my nuanced expertise to catch the difference between these types of data.\n\nHere's my thought process as I went through the list:\n\n*   **Initial Scan:** Quickly look for obvious red flags (intensifiers, comparatives).\n*   **Contextual Analysis:** If something looked suspicious, I delved into the context.  Was it technical language? Was it about economic metrics?  Was it offering reassurance? Was the scale or metric presented as a fact?\n*   **Rule Application:** The core of it all, I strictly applied the given rules for Q1, carefully checking for modifiers, fixed idiom, and exclusions.\n*   **Edge Cases:** I had to be especially alert for borderline cases that might be missed. I was careful to discern the difference between an adjective and a metric, an action versus vivid verb.\n*   **Double-Check:** After each segment, I re-confirmed my assessment.  Was I being fair? Did I miss anything?\n*   **JSON Array Creation:** Finally, the results were neatly packaged into the required JSON structure.\n\nMy analysis returned the following results:  13 segments met the criteria for Q1 triggering \"Alarmist\" language. The key here was that I was not just looking for negative words, but for the combination of those words with a strong modifier, or the specific phrase \"deadly from the start\".\n"
