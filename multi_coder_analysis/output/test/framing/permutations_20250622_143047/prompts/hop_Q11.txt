### QUICK DECISION CHECK
• Direct QUOTE contains explicit Alarmist cue (**EXTREMELY CONCERNING / IMMEDIATE ACTION / HIGH RISK / CATASTROPHIC**) **OR** explicit Reassuring cue (**NO CAUSE FOR ALARM / EXCELLENT NEWS / SAFE TO EAT / VERY WELL PROTECTED**).  
• If both or balanced → `"no"` (mixed → Neutral).  
→ If one side dominant → `"yes"` and append `||FRAME=Alarmist` or `||FRAME=Reassuring`.

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: "Meanwhile, Kirby Institute head Professor Raina MacIntyre described the bird flu news as 'extremely concerning and requires immediate action.'"
## Question: Does a directly quoted source provide a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"Quoted source uses 'extremely concerning and requires immediate action' providing dominant alarmist frame. ||FRAME=Alarmist"}

# NO example
## Input Segment: "Meanwhile, Professor MacIntyre described the news as 'concerning,' but noted that avian flu viruses do not transmit easily in humans."
## Question: Does a directly quoted source provide a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"Quote has 'concerning' but is balanced by factual counter-statement without explicit reassuring language, resulting in mixed/neutral overall."}

# NEW example – balanced quote (stays Neutral)
## Input Segment:
## "This development is 'concerning', but the virus 'does not transmit easily in humans,' the expert said."
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"Initial alarm word 'concerning' is balanced by neutral factual clause without explicit reassurance; no dominant frame. ||FRAME=Neutral"}

### Question Q11 (**Quote-presence hard-guard**)
**Q11: Primacy of Framed Quotations – Dominant Quote Check**

Does a directly quoted source within the segment provide a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame (per detailed definitions in `step-0-meta-details` and specific frame definitions) that is not overridden or equally balanced by other quotes or strong authorial counter-framing, as per the "Guidance Note: Primacy of Framed Quotations"?

**🔍 Q11 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **Outcome** |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Alarmist – Dominant Quote** | "extremely concerning and requires immediate action." | **Alarmist** | dominant alarm |
| **Alarmist – Intensified High-Risk** | "definitely considered a period of high risk" | **Alarmist** | intensified risk assessment |
| **Neutral – Bare risk-adj in quote** | "This virus is deadly to birds." | **Neutral** | base risk adjective without intensifier |
| **Dominant Reassuring Quote** | "no cause for alarm," "excellent news," "very well protected" | → Reassuring |
| **Balanced/Mixed Quotes** | "concerning, but viruses do not transmit easily" | → Neutral |
| **Neutral Quotes Only** | "officials are monitoring," "tests are ongoing" | → Proceed to Q12 |

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Guidance Note: Primacy of Framed Quotations (SUPERSEDES PREVIOUS QUOTE RULES)**
**Technical-term override**  
Before deciding that a quoted risk-adjective is Alarmist under Q11,  
**skip** the cue if the adjective is immediately preceded (≤ 3 tokens) by the
whitelisted biomedical collocations:  
*"highly pathogenic"*, *"highly pathogenic avian"*, *"HPAI"*.  
Rationale: Q1 technical-term guard has higher precedence and treats these
as neutral taxonomy, not intensification.

**Preparedness safety-link check**  
When a quote says *"fully/well prepared (ready) to handle/deal with …"* **but** lacks an explicit public/consumer safety link within 40 chars (e.g., "so consumers are safe"), treat it as **Neutral** rather than Reassuring.

Core Principle: If – **and only if** – a statement is
  (a) delimited by quotation marks **OR** introduced with a
      colon‑style attribution inside ≤ 5 tokens  
      (e.g. *Officials said: "..."*) **AND**
  (b) spoken by a **named or institutional speaker**,  
then treat it as a direct quotation for Q11 purposes.
Attributions such as *"according to a report / overview / study"*
without quoted wording are **NOT** treated as quotations and cannot
trigger Q11.

If a quoted sentence contains both alarm **and** de-escalating clauses,
score **Neutral** **unless** one side *clearly outguns* the other –
meaning it deploys a *higher‑precedence cue* **or** ≥ 2 distinct cues
of the same polarity.  Mild "concerning" vs "not severe" remains
Neutral.  In true *mixed*
cases, Neutral prevails.

If no regex pattern matches **and** the quote is > 600 chars, summarise manually;
else fall through to Q12 Neutral.
