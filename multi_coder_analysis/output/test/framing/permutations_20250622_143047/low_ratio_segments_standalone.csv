721,seg_v5_003_721_chunk0,"The reason for that confidence [in elimination], Deeble said, is that investigations have shown it’s the transport of cows, as well as the shared use of equipment and vehicles, that is spreading the virus [H5N1]."
800,seg_v5_44_800_chunk0,C.D.C. officials were able to sequence only a portion of the virus isolated from the hospitalized patient.
355,seg_v5_14_355_chunk0,"Officials stress that bird flu isn't a threat to food safety because all the birds on a farm where the disease is found are slaughtered before they reach the food supply, and properly cooking poultry and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.89 degrees Celsius) will kill any viruses."

We’ve seen very few cases in humans since then [mid-2015/2016]. And part of that [the reason for very few human cases] is that the virus has changed—it [the virus]’s mutated to the point of where it is infecting other mammalian species and birds at an increasing rate. But we’ve had no evidence yet that [the change/mutation allowing infection of mammals/birds]’s happened for humans or for pigs."

805,seg_v5_54_805_chunk0,"In particular, do you think this new clade Ib outbreak is stoppable?"
358,seg_v5_20_358_chunk0,Agriculture economists estimate that the industry has also suffered at least another $1 billion in damages from lost sales and other costs though the total cost to the industry hasn't been tallied up.

805,seg_v5_68_805_chunk0,"I don’t know if it’s going to be two years, three years, five years, but I do feel like there are some incipient breakthroughs. So I don’t think it’s time to give up."

408,seg_v5_043_408_chunk0,"Then, if you look at 2015, that was when we saw the major increase in cases in Africa—in Egypt, along the Nile River Valley, in people raising domestic ducks. That time [In 2015] there were [hundreds of] cases in Egypt alone that year in humans. And the thought was that [the thought/prediction], you know, ‘it [an influenza pandemic from H5N1]’s just imminent now that we're going to see an influenza pandemic from H5N1.’"

71,seg_v5_015_71_chunk0,"We're not seeing a massive outbreak on a large scale and so I think it's too soon to be concerned about food impact or pricing impact at this point, but you have to acknowledge that can be an issue over time, he [Naig] said."
1009,seg_v5_16_1009_chunk0,"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world."
1010,seg_v5_016_1010_chunk0,"Nonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak.

These errors [in genome copying] don't always work in favor of the virus. Most of the time, viruses with errors [in genome copying] won't work or be fit enough to continue to copy and survive. But every once in a while, a random error [in genome copying] can result in a change to the virus that gives it an advantage in its environment, and that version of the virus will continue to spread and grow."

803,seg_v5_004_803_chunk0,But the fact that they became ill after treating this patient raises the specter of person-to-person spread of the virus—a possibility that flu experts say needs further exploration. Testing their [four additional health care workers'] blood for antibodies to H5N1 should answer the question [of whether they were infected].
408,seg_v5_085_408_chunk0,"At this point, again, the virus, as it [the virus] is, I don't believe poses a major risk to humans. But that [the virus not posing a major risk], as I said, could change overnight if there were mutational changes to the virus."
