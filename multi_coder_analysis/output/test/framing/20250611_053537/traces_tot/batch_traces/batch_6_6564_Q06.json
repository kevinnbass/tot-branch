biggest chicken meat-producing state.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_13_1002_chunk0)\nAlmost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_14_1002_chunk0)\nHuman infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_15_1002_chunk0)\nNo Americans are recorded to have contracted highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_16_1002_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_1_100_chunk0)\nAnother 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed after bird flu spread to two more Iowa farms, state agriculture officials announced Sunday.\n\n###

seg_v5_14_1000_chunk0)\nKentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken-meat producing state and that it is working 'diligently' to prevent the disease from spreading to other poultry flocks.\n\n### Segment 40 (ID: seg_v5_15_1000_chunk0)\nThe flu outbreaks are hitting the country at a time when poultry market supplies have dropped due to the COVID-19 pandemic and labor shortages.\n\n### Segment 41 (ID: seg_v5_16_1000_chunk0)\nAccording to Reuters, data has found that frozen chicken supplies were down 14 percent from a year ago at the end of December, while turkey inventories were down 23 percent.\n\n### Segment 42 (ID: seg_v5_1_1002_chunk0)\nAccording to the agency, bird flu was found in Fauquier County, Virginia; and in Fulton County, Kentucky, on Feb. 12, in non-poultry birds and

birds often carry strains of avian influenza and they’re often low pathogenic, which means they don’t kill the birds.\n\n### Segment 55 (ID: seg_v5_17_1005_chunk0)\nU.S. surveillance efforts have identified the virus [H5N1] in wild birds in recent weeks in New Hampshire, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and South Carolina, making it [H5N1] apparent that it [H5N1] is in the environment broadly.\n\n### Segment 56 (ID: seg_v5_18_1005_chunk0)\nThe virus [H5N1] spreads easily from wild bird droppings and can be carried into commercial flocks on the feet of workers or on equipment, which is why high-level biosecurity protocol has been activated across the country in commercial operations.\n\n### Segment 57 (ID: seg_v5_19_1005_chunk0)\nThey [commercial operations]’ve

Monday.\n\n### Segment 60 (ID: seg_v5_2_1001_chunk0)\nDozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\n\n### Segment 61 (ID: seg_v5_3_1001_chunk0)\nAvian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_4_1001_chunk0)\nBirds at a commercial turkey farm in Southern Indiana contracted the virus [avian flu] last week, forcing officials to cull 29,000 turkeys in an attempt to stop the spread.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_5_1001_chunk0)\nA backyard flock of mixed birds in Virginia had to be culled after they [the backyard flock] tested positive for avian flu.\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_6_1001_chunk0)\nOfficials are also working to depopulate a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, that tested positive for the flu [avian flu].\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_7_1001_chunk0)\nTest results are still pending for a separate flock in Webster County.\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_8_1001_chunk0)\nThe culled birds will not enter the food system at a time when the agricultural industry is already being challenged by rising inflation and supply chain issues.\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_9_1001_chunk0)\nThe price index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs saw the largest increase among all food groups last month, rising 12.2% over January of last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n### Segment 68 (ID: seg_v5_10_1001_chunk0)\nPoultry farms in Africa, Europe, and Asia are also dealing with avian flu.\n\n### Segment 69 (ID: seg_v5_1_10_chunk0)\nMore than 35,000 chickens are to be culled at a Dutch farm after a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu was discovered there, the agriculture ministry announced Thursday.\n\n### Segment 70 (ID: seg_v5_2_10_chunk0)\nThe outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\n\n### Segment 71 (ID: seg_v5_3_10_chunk0)\nThe government did not immediately report the exact strain of bird flu that infected chickens on the farm.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_4_10_chunk0)\nThe agriculture ministry tightened controls Thursday around the infected farm in the village of Altforst, 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the capital, Amsterdam.\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_5_10_chunk0)\nAnother 34 farms are situated within a 10-kilometer (6 mile) radius of the infected location.\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_6_10_chunk0)\nAuthorities banned the transport of any birds, eggs, manure, used straw and other animal products from the 10-kilometer ring around the infected farm.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_2_1005_chunk0)\nThe new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_3_1005_chunk0)\nThe 29,000 turkeys in the flock were killed to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_4_1005_chunk0)\nThe poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_5_1005_chunk0)\nEgg, turkey and chicken prices could rise and availability could drop if birds at enough farms were to be infected.\n\n### Segment 79 (ID: seg_v5_6_1005_chunk0)\n“It’s definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry,” said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association.\n\n\n#

  "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segments Against the Q6 \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" Rule for Reassurance**\n\nAs the expert claim-framing coder, my task was to analyze each provided text segment and determine if it utilized a \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" frame for Reassurance, as defined by Q6 in the decision tree. This required the presence of both a minimiser token (like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely\") and an explicit scale contrast (\"out of thousands,\" \"among millions,\" etc.) working together to downplay the significance of the information.  \n\nAfter meticulously reviewing all 79 segments, my professional judgment concludes that **none of them meet the stringent criteria of Q6.**  While many segments mention numbers, outbreaks, or impacted populations, they consistently lack the necessary combination of minimiser and explicit scale.  For instance, we see phrases like \"rare but can occur,\" \"25,000 turkeys,\" or \"dozens tested positive.\" However, the critical elements of *both* a qualifying minimiser *and* an explicit scale contrast are consistently absent.  The presence of negations, numbers with bare quantifiers, and even seemingly reassuring statements like \"no immediate public health concern\" pushed these segments into potentially different areas, such as Q5 (Explicit Calming) or Q7 (Bare Negations).  The task was to *find* the structure and in the dataset this construction could not be found. Each segment was individually scrutinized for this specific pattern, but my analysis confirms that the Q6 \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" frame is not present within this corpus.\n"
