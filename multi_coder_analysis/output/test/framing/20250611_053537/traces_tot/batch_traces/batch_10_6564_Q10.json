It was not clear how the bird flu virus found its way to the farms.\n\n### Segment 4 (ID: seg_v5_013_1003_chunk0)\nWild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\n\n### Segment 5 (ID: seg_v5_14_1002_chunk0)\nHuman infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\n\n### Segment 6 (ID: seg_v5_16_1002_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_3_100_chunk0)\nThe latest cases were at a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_002_1003_chunk0)\nInfections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_003_1003_chunk0)\nLast week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_004_1003_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials said.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_12_1000_chunk0)\nLast week, Mexico joined several other countries in banning or limiting poultry imports from Indiana following the disease outbreak.\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_1_1002_chunk0)\nAccording to the agency, bird flu was found in Fauquier County, Virginia; and in Fulton County, Kentucky, on Feb. 12, in non-poultry birds and commercial broiler chickens, respectively.\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_2_1002_chunk0)\nOn Feb. 8, bird influenza was detected in commercial turkeys in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_6_1002_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID: seg_v5_7_1002_chunk0)\nThey [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\n\n### Segment 16 (ID: seg_v5_8_1002_chunk0)\nTyson Foods Inc. confirmed that a flock of about 240,000 chickens tested positive.\n\n### Segment 17 (ID: seg_v5_12_1005_chunk0)\nThe strain now circulating is H5N1 and is related to the 2015 virus.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_13_1005_chunk0)\nIt [H5N1] has been circulating for months in Europe and Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the U.S. case was identified.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_1_1001_chunk0)\nAvian flu has now been detected in flocks of birds in Virginia and Kentucky, just days after Indiana officials had to euthanize 29,000 turkeys due to the spread of the virus [avian flu], the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Monday.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_2_1001_chunk0)\nDozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_10_1001_chunk0)\nPoultry farms in Africa, Europe, and Asia are also dealing with avian flu.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_3_10_chunk0)\nThe government did not immediately report the exact strain of bird flu that infected chickens on the farm.\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_5_10_chunk0)\nAnother 34 farms are situated within a 10-kilometer (6 mile) radius of the infected location.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_2_1005_chunk0)\nThe new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_6_1005_chunk0)\n“It’s definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry,” said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association.\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)\n#  -----------------------------------------------------------\n✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**\n1.

  "thoughts": "**My Expert Assessment of Text Segments Against the Neutral Claim Framing Rule**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown. I've been tasked with applying a specific rule (Q10) to a series of text segments. The core of this rule is to identify if a segment *speculates* about future relief or improvement without explicitly using a \"calming cue.\" My job is to act as a claim-framing coder, and in that capacity I must determine a Neutral frame if this condition is met.\n\nI've gone through each segment, one by one. For each, I considered whether the segment contains speculation about potential future relief or improvement. Based on my analysis, I've concluded that *none* of the provided segments meet this criteria. They primarily describe current situations, report past events, or outline ongoing mechanisms. No segment includes language that anticipates or predicts future improvement or resolution. I can provide the output now.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_11_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment describes a current condition (infection rare).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_1_1_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment reports a past/current event (deaths).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_4_1_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment reports past/current events (confirmation, location, origin unknown).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_013_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment describes a current/ongoing mechanism and a past event.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_14_1002_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment describes a current condition ('do occur', 'are rare').\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_16_1002_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment describes historical events.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_3_100_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment reports recent events (latest cases).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_002_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment reports a consequence of current/past events (triggered restrictions, blocking).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_003_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment reports a past event (limited purchases).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_004_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment reports a past event (were infected).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_12_1000_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment reports a past event (joined banning/limiting).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_1_1002_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment reports past events (was found).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_2_1002_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment reports a past event (was detected).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_6_1002_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment reports a past event (were infected).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_7_1002_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment reports a current status"
