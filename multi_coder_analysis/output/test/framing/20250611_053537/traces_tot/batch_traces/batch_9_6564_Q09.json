It was not clear how the bird flu virus found its way to the farms.\n\n### Segment 4 (ID: seg_v5_14_1004_chunk0)\nAccording to the Associated Press, the bird flu strain currently circulating in the U.S. is H5N1, and is related to the 2015 avian virus that killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion.\n\n### Segment 5 (ID: seg_v5_013_1003_chunk0)\nWild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\n\n### Segment 6 (ID: seg_v5_014_1003_chunk0)\nThe United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government.\n\n### Segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_015_1003_chunk0)\nKentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken-meat producing state.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_016_1003_chunk0)\nAlmost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_017_1003_chunk0)\nThe disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_018_1003_chunk0)\nGovernment data showed U.S. frozen chicken supplies were down 14 percent from a year ago at the end of December while turkey inventories were down 23 percent.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_11_1002_chunk0)\nThe United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government.\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_12_1002_chunk0)\nKentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken meat-producing state.\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_13_1002_chunk0)\nAlmost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_14_1002_chunk0)\nHuman infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID: seg_v5_16_1002_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 16 (ID: seg_v5_2_100_chunk0)\nSince the outbreak began a month ago, millions of fowl have been killed, many of them in Iowa, which is the nation’s leading egg producer.\n\n### Segment 17 (ID: seg_v5_3_100_chunk0)\nThe latest cases were at a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_002_1003_chunk0)\nInfections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_003_1003_chunk0)\nLast week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_004_1003_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials said.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_12_1000_chunk0)\nLast week, Mexico joined several other countries in banning or limiting poultry imports from Indiana following the disease outbreak.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_13_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. is currently the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to Reuters.\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_15_1000_chunk0)\nThe flu outbreaks are hitting the country at a time when poultry market supplies have dropped due to the COVID-19 pandemic and labor shortages.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_16_1000_chunk0)\nAccording to Reuters, data has found that frozen chicken supplies were down 14 percent from a year ago at the end of December, while turkey inventories were down 23 percent.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_1_1002_chunk0)\nAccording to the agency, bird flu was found in Fauquier County, Virginia;

  "thoughts": "**Summary of Q9 Application**\n\nAs instructed, I've gone through each text segment, meticulously applying Q9 to determine if it primarily reports prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs (like \"down,\" \"largest,\" \"second-largest,\" \"cost\") and potentially neutral adverbs, while avoiding vivid verbs, risk adjectives, or explicit framing.\n\nHere's a breakdown of my thought process:\n\n*   **Initial Review:** I carefully read each segment, looking for indicators of economic reporting. This means paying close attention to verbs and phrases that describe changes in price, supply, production, trade, or market conditions. I looked for numerical data, such as percentages, rankings, and monetary values.\n*   **Segment-by-Segment Analysis:** For each segment, I considered whether it reported prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using the criteria. If the segment met the criteria, I marked it as \"Yes\" and identified the decisive cues. Otherwise, I marked it \"No.\"\n*   **Focus on the Core Criteria:** The key was to distinguish between factual reports (e.g., reporting deaths, locations) and direct economic reporting. Phrases like \"supplies are down,\" \"largest producer,\" or \"cost...$1 billion\" were the types of indicators I was looking for. I ensured these indicators were using standard verbs and not framing.\n*   **Avoidance of Over-Interpretation:** I ensured to interpret the segments very conservatively. Anything that involved verbs outside the criteria or framing was excluded. Technical terms were ignored.\n*   **JSON Array Generation:** The plan is to create a JSON array to report the results to the user.\n\nHere's the list of segments that were considered \"Yes,\" along with the decisive cues:\n\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_14\\_1004\\_chunk0**: \"cost the federal government nearly $1 billion\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_013\\_1003\\_chunk0**: \"largest producer and second-largest exporter\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_015\\_1003\\_chunk0**: \"seventh biggest chicken-meat producing state\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_016\\_1003\\_chunk0**: \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_017\\_1003\\_chunk0**: \"poultry supplies are down\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_018\\_1003\\_chunk0**: \"supplies were down 14 percent\", \"inventories were down 23 percent\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_11\\_1002\\_chunk0**: \"largest producer and second-largest exporter\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_12\\_1002\\_chunk0**: \"seventh biggest chicken meat-producing state\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_13\\_1002\\_chunk0**: \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_2\\_100\\_chunk0**: \"nation’s leading egg producer\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_13\\_1000\\_chunk0**: \"largest producer and second-largest exporter\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_15\\_1000\\_chunk0**: \"poultry market supplies have dropped\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_16\\_1000\\_chunk0**: \"supplies were down 14 percent\", \"inventories were down 23 percent\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_9\\_1001\\_chunk0**: \"price index... rising 12.2%\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_5\\_1005\\_chunk0**: \"prices could rise and availability could drop\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_3\\_100\\_chunk0**: \"supplies are down\"\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_10\\_1002\\_chunk0**: \"supplies were down 14 percent\", \"inventories were down 23 percent\"\n\nI am now ready to convert this information into a JSON array, as per the user's instructions.\n"
