'As part of existing avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks,' the agency [APHIS] added.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_12_1000_chunk0)\nLast week, Mexico joined several other countries in banning or limiting poultry imports from Indiana following the disease outbreak.\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_13_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. is currently the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to Reuters.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_14_1000_chunk0)\nKentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken-meat producing state and that it is working 'diligently' to prevent the disease from spreading to other poultry flocks.\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_15_1000_chunk0)\nThe flu outbreaks are hitting the country at a time when poultry market supplies have dropped due to the COVID-19 pandemic and labor shortages.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_16_1000_chunk0)\nAccording to Reuters, data has found that frozen chicken supplies were down 14 percent from a year ago at the end of December, while turkey inventories were down 23

38 (ID: seg_v5_6_1002_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 39 (ID: seg_v5_7_1002_chunk0)\nThey [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more

Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the U.S. case was identified.\n\n### Segment 45 (ID: seg_v5_17_1005_chunk0)\nU.S. surveillance efforts have identified the virus [H5N1] in wild birds in recent weeks in New Hampshire, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and South Carolina, making it [H5N1] apparent that it [H5N1] is in the environment broadly.\n\n### Segment 46 (ID: seg_v5_18_1005_chunk0)\nThe virus [H5N1] spreads easily from wild bird droppings and can be carried into commercial flocks on the feet of workers or on equipment, which is why high-level biosecurity protocol has been activated across the country in commercial operations.\n\n### Segment 47 (ID: seg_v5_19_1005_chunk0)\nThey [commercial operations]’ve enacted new safeguards to prevent deadly bird flu infections, often referred to as HPAI, and isolate them [deadly bird flu infections] when they [deadly bird flu infections] occur.\n\n### Segment 48 (ID: seg_v5_20_1005_chunk0)\n“With the increased preparatory efforts USDA and its partners have put into place since the 2015 HPAI outbreak, we are fully prepared to handle this detection,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA, which deals with outbreaks on U.S.\n\n### Segment 49 (ID: seg_v5_1_1001_chunk0)\nAvian flu has now been detected in flocks of birds in Virginia and Kentucky, just days after Indiana officials had to euthanize 29,000 turkeys due to the spread of the virus [avian flu], the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Monday.\n\n### Segment 50 (ID: seg_v5_2_1001_chunk0)\nDozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\n\n### Segment 51 (ID: seg_v5_4_1001_chunk0)\nBirds at a commercial turkey farm in Southern Indiana contracted the virus [avian flu] last week, forcing officials to cull 29,000 turkeys in an attempt to stop the spread.\n\n### Segment 52 (ID: seg_v5_5_1001_chunk0)\nA backyard flock of mixed birds in Virginia had to be culled after they [the backyard flock] tested positive for avian flu.\n\n### Segment 53 (ID: seg_v5_6_1001_chunk0)\nOfficials are also working to depopulate a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, that tested positive for the flu [avian flu].\n\n### Segment 54 (ID: seg_v5_7_1001_chunk0)\nTest results are still pending for a separate flock in Webster County.\n\n### Segment 55 (ID: seg_v5_9_1001_chunk0)\nThe price index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs saw the largest increase among all food groups last month, rising 12.2% over January of last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n### Segment 56 (ID: seg_v5_10_1001_chunk0)\nPoultry farms in Africa, Europe, and Asia are also dealing with avian flu.\n\n### Segment 57 (ID: seg_v5_1_10_chunk0)\nMore than 35,000 chickens are to be culled at a Dutch farm after a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu was discovered there, the agriculture ministry announced Thursday.\n\n### Segment 58 (ID: seg_v5_2_10_chunk0)\nThe outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\n\n### Segment 59 (ID: seg_v5_3_10_chunk0)\nThe government did not immediately report the exact strain of bird flu that infected chickens on the farm.\n\n### Segment 60 (ID: seg_v5_4_10_chunk0)\nThe agriculture ministry tightened controls Thursday around the infected farm in the village of Altforst, 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the capital, Amsterdam.\n\n### Segment 61 (ID: seg_v5_5_10_chunk0)\nAnother 34 farms are situated within a 10-kilometer (6 mile) radius of the infected location.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_6_10_chunk0)\nAuthorities banned the transport of any birds, eggs, manure, used straw and other animal products from the 10-kilometer ring around the infected farm.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_2_1005_chunk0)\nThe new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_3_1005_chunk0)\nThe 29,000 turkeys in the flock were killed to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_4_1005_chunk0)\nThe poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry.\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_5_1005_chunk0)\nEgg, turkey and chicken prices could rise and availability could drop if birds at enough farms were to be infected.\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_6_1005_chunk0)\n“It’s definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry,” said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association.\n\n\n#
