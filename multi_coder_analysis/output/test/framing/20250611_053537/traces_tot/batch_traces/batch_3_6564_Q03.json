(Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: \"The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%.\" (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).\n* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: \"Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds.\" (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').\n\n**Key Principle:** \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" \"plummeted\" can be potent verbs on their own (see Q2) if used dramatically.

It was not clear how the bird flu virus found its way to the farms.\n\n### Segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_11_1004_chunk0)\nIn addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state or federal officials.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_12_1004_chunk0)\nThe risk of humans contracting bird flu is very low, and any flock found to have an infected bird does not enter the food chain.\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_13_1004_chunk0)\nThe virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_14_1004_chunk0)\nAccording to the Associated Press, the bird flu strain currently circulating in the U.S. is H5N1, and is related to the 2015 avian virus that killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_011_1003_chunk0)\nThe disease was also detected in a backyard flock of birds in Fauquier County, Virginia, that have already been culled, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_012_1003_chunk0)\nThe cases [backyard flock case] do not present an immediate public health concern, the agency [U.S. Department of Agriculture] said.\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_013_1003_chunk0)\nWild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_014_1003_chunk0)\nThe United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID: seg_v5_015_1003_chunk0)\nKentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken-meat producing state.\n\n### Segment 16 (ID: seg_v5_016_1003_chunk0)\nAlmost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\n\n### Segment 17 (ID: seg_v5_017_1003_chunk0)\nThe disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_018_1003_chunk0)\nGovernment data showed U.S. frozen chicken supplies were down 14 percent from a year ago at the end of December while turkey inventories were down 23 percent.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_11_1002_chunk0)\nThe United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_12_1002_chunk0)\nKentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken meat-producing state.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_13_1002_chunk0)\nAlmost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_14_1002_chunk0)\nHuman infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_15_1002_chunk0)\nNo Americans are recorded to have contracted highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_16_1002_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_1_100_chunk0)\nAnother 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed after bird flu spread to two more Iowa farms, state agriculture officials announced Sunday.\n\n### Segment 26 (ID: seg_v5_2_100_chunk0)\nSince the outbreak began a month ago, millions of fowl have been killed, many of them in Iowa, which is the nation’s leading egg producer.\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_3_100_chunk0)\nThe latest cases were at a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County.\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_5_100_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the cases in birds do not present an immediate public health concern.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_6_100_chunk0)\nNo human cases of the avian influenza virus have been detected in the United States. It remains safe to eat poultry products.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_8_100_chunk0)\nCooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165°F kills bacteria and viruses.\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_002_1003_chunk0)\nInfections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_003_1003_chunk0)\nLast week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_004_1003_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials said.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_006_1003_chunk0)\nBirds from the infected flock will be culled and will not enter the food system, state officials said.\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_007_1003_chunk0)\nTyson Foods is working with government authorities to prevent the disease from spreading and is heightening safety measures at other local farms, spokesman Gary Mickelson said.\n\n### Segment 36 (ID: seg_v5_008_1003_chunk0)\nThe outbreak is not expected to lower overall chicken production levels because thousands of farms raise chickens for Tyson, he [spokesman Gary Mickelson] said.\n\n### Segment 37 (ID: seg_v5_009_1003_chunk0)\nMickelson added that Tyson Foods' chicken products are safe to eat.\n\n### Segment 38 (ID: seg_v5_010_1003_chunk0)\nOn Tuesday, Kentucky officials expect final test results for a separate suspected outbreak among turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 39 (ID: seg_v5_11_1000_chunk0)\nAPHIS urged Americans involved with poultry production from small-scale backyard operations to large commercial environments to review their biosecurity activities and prevent contact between their birds and wild bird populations. 'As part of existing avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks,' the agency [APHIS] added.\n\n### Segment 40 (ID: seg_v5_12_1000_chunk0)\nLast week, Mexico joined several other countries in banning or limiting poultry imports from Indiana following the disease outbreak.\n\n### Segment 41 (ID: seg_v5_13_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. is currently the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to Reuters.\n\n### Segment 42 (ID: seg_v5_14_1000_chunk0)\nKentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken-meat producing state and that it is working 'diligently' to prevent the disease from spreading to other poultry flocks.\n\n### Segment 43 (ID: seg_v5_15_1000_chunk0)\nThe flu outbreaks are hitting the country at a time when poultry market supplies have dropped due to the COVID-19 pandemic and labor shortages.\n\n### Segment 44 (ID: seg_v5_16_1000_chunk0)\nAccording to Reuters, data has found that frozen chicken supplies were down 14 percent from a year ago at the end of December, while turkey inventories were down 23 percent.\n\n### Segment 45 (ID: seg_v5_1_1002_chunk0)\nAccording to the agency, bird flu was found in Fauquier County, Virginia; and in Fulton County, Kentucky, on Feb. 12, in non-poultry birds and commercial broiler chickens, respectively.\n\n### Segment 46 (ID: seg_v5_2_1002_chunk0)\nOn Feb. 8, bird influenza was detected in commercial turkeys in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 47 (ID: seg_v5_3_1002_chunk0)\nCiting the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the USDA said that \"these avian influenza detections do not present an immediate public health concern.\"\n\n### Segment 48 (ID: seg_v5_4_1002_chunk0)\n\"No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.\"\n\n### Segment 49 (ID: seg_v5_5_1002_chunk0)\nAs a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 [degrees] F kills bacteria and viruses,\" the agency added.\n\n### Segment 50 (ID: seg_v5_6_1002_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 51 (ID: seg_v5_7_1002_chunk0)\nThey [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and

(ID: seg_v5_12_1005_chunk0)\nThe strain now circulating is H5N1 and is related to the 2015 virus.\n\n### Segment 56 (ID: seg_v5_13_1005_chunk0)\nIt [H5N1] has been circulating for months in Europe and Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the U.S. case was identified.\n\n### Segment 57 (ID: seg_v5_14_1005_chunk0)\nMigratory wild birds often carry strains of avian influenza and they’re often low pathogenic, which means they don’t kill the birds.\n\n### Segment 58 (ID: seg_v5_17_1005_chunk0)\nU.S. surveillance efforts have identified the virus [H5N1] in wild birds in recent weeks in New Hampshire, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and South Carolina, making it [H5N1] apparent that it [H5N1] is in the environment broadly.\n\n### Segment 59 (ID: seg_v5_18_1005_chunk0)\nThe virus [H5N1] spreads easily from wild bird droppings and can be carried into commercial flocks on the feet of workers or on equipment, which is why high-level biosecurity protocol has been activated across the country in commercial operations.\n\n### Segment 60 (ID: seg_v5_19_1005_chunk0)\nThey [commercial operations]’ve enacted new safeguards to prevent deadly bird flu infections, often referred to as HPAI, and isolate them [deadly bird flu infections] when they [deadly bird flu infections] occur.\n\n### Segment 61 (ID: seg_v5_20_1005_chunk0)\n“With the increased preparatory efforts USDA and its partners have put into place since the 2015 HPAI outbreak, we are fully prepared to handle this detection,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA, which deals with outbreaks on U.S.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_1_1001_chunk0)\nAvian flu has now been detected in flocks of birds in Virginia and Kentucky, just days after Indiana officials had to euthanize 29,000 turkeys due to the spread of the virus [avian flu], the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Monday.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_2_1001_chunk0)\nDozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_3_1001_chunk0)\nAvian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_4_1001_chunk0)\nBirds at a commercial turkey farm in Southern Indiana contracted the virus [avian flu] last week, forcing officials to cull 29,000 turkeys in an attempt to stop the spread.\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_5_1001_chunk0)\nA backyard flock of mixed birds in Virginia had to be culled after they [the backyard flock] tested positive for avian flu.\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_6_1001_chunk0)\nOfficials are also working to depopulate a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, that tested positive for the flu [avian flu].\n\n### Segment 68 (ID: seg_v5_7_1001_chunk0)\nTest results are still pending for a separate flock in Webster County.\n\n### Segment 69 (ID: seg_v5_8_1001_chunk0)\nThe culled birds will not enter the food system at a time when the agricultural industry is already being challenged by rising inflation and supply chain issues.\n\n### Segment 70 (ID: seg_v5_9_1001_chunk0)\nThe price index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs saw the largest increase among all food groups last month, rising 12.2% over January of last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n### Segment 71 (ID: seg_v5_10_1001_chunk0)\nPoultry farms in Africa, Europe, and Asia are also dealing with avian flu.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_1_10_chunk0)\nMore than 35,000 chickens are to be culled at a Dutch farm after a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu was discovered there, the agriculture ministry announced Thursday.\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_2_10_chunk0)\nThe outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_3_10_chunk0)\nThe government did not immediately report the exact strain of bird flu that infected chickens on the farm.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_4_10_chunk0)\nThe agriculture ministry tightened controls Thursday around the infected farm in the village of Altforst, 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the capital, Amsterdam.\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_5_10_chunk0)\nAnother 34 farms are situated within a 10-kilometer (6 mile) radius of the infected location.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_6_10_chunk0)\nAuthorities banned the transport of any birds, eggs, manure, used straw and other animal products from the 10-kilometer ring around the infected farm.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_2_1005_chunk0)\nThe new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 79 (ID: seg_v5_3_1005_chunk0)\nThe 29,000 turkeys in the flock were killed to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 80 (ID: seg_v5_4_1005_chunk0)\nThe poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry.\n\n### Segment 81 (ID: seg_v5_5_1005_chunk0)\nEgg, turkey and chicken prices could rise and availability could drop if birds at enough farms were to be infected.\n\n### Segment 82 (ID: seg_v5_6_1005_chunk0)\n“It’s definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry,” said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association.\n\n### Segment 83 (ID: seg_v5_7_1005_chunk0)\n“I feel positive that we can tackle this situation better and I have my fingers crossed that this will be an isolated case, however, I would hope for the best and be prepared for the worst.”\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)\n#

  "thoughts": "**Summary of Q3 Analysis**\n\nAlright, let's break down this text segment by segment, applying the Q3 decision tree criteria. The key here is looking for \"moderate verbs\" paired with clear-cut, significant impact/scale information. We're specifically excluding plain outcome verbs (like \"killed\", \"affected\") and any passive or future tense forms (\"to be culled\", \"planning to cull\"). The scale/impact needs to be explicitly linked to the action – think \"millions culled\" or \"record losses.\"\n\nI've carefully examined each segment, checking for the presence of the Q3 verbs (\"hit\", \"swept\", \"surged\", \"soared\", etc.) while being mindful of those excluded verbs and tenses. I've also kept a close eye on the context, ensuring any impact information is directly linked to the identified verb and clearly indicative of significant scale or consequence.\n\nBased on this meticulous review, I've concluded that *none* of the provided segments meet the criteria for a \"yes\" answer. While many segments discuss deaths, culling, supply drops, and so on, the verbs used either fall into the excluded categories (e.g., \"killed\", \"euthanized\") or are simply not present in the Q3 list (\"contracted,\" \"spread,\" etc.). The few instances where a Q3 verb like \"hitting\" appears, the required strong pairing with a clear impact statement is missing, making them ineligible.\n\nTherefore, applying the decision tree, the response for all segments is consistently \"no.\"\n"
