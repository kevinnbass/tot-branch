seg_v5_11_1001_chunk0,Neutral,Frame determined by Q7 trigger. Rationale: 'Human infection is rare' is a bare negation/downplaying statement without an explicit calming cue.,"[{""Q"": 1, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**My Evaluation of the Segment's Applicability to Q1**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with checking if \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal\"" fits the criteria of Q1. Let's break this down. Q1, as I understand it, looks for intensifiers or comparatives that modify risk-adjectives.\n\nMy initial thought is to examine each word carefully. \""Rare\"" jumps out immediately. But hold on, \""rare\"" describes frequency, not the *severity* or *risk level* in the way we're thinking about, like something being \""deadly\"" or \""dangerous.\"" That's not the angle Q1 is aiming for.\n\nNext, I see \""infected animal.\"" While \""infected\"" relates to the *source* of the risk, it's not on my list of relevant risk adjectives I keep in mind for Q1. Things like \""lethal,\"" \""virulent,\"" \""contagious,\"" *that* sort of thing. It's not the same.\n\nFinally, I'm scanning for any intensifiers or comparatives \u2013 words like \""very,\"" \""extremely,\"" \""more,\"" or \""less\"" \u2013 modifying *any* potential risk adjective. There are none. There are no such modifiers.\n\nTherefore, after this careful analysis, I conclude that the segment *does not* meet the criteria of Q1.\n""}, {""Q"": 2, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""The segment uses neutral language ('is rare', 'can occur') and does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases listed in Q2."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**Q2 Analysis: A Neutral Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet, and the task is to run it through the Q2 filter of our 12-step decision tree. Essentially, I need to check for alarmist framing. My radar is set to detect any of the red flags defined in Q2: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative noun combinations, or the \""on high alert\"" phrase.\n\nI've carefully examined the text: \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"" My expert eye quickly scanned for the telltale signs. No strong verbs like \""ravaged\"" or \""devastated\"" jumped out.  No superlative-negative pairings like \""worst crisis\"" were present.  \""On high alert\"" is a no-show.  Finally, I found no metaphorical landmines like \""ticking time-bomb.\""\n\nThe language is pretty straightforward and neutral. The key phrases are \""is rare\"" and \""can occur\"" combined with \""close contact\"", which, while potentially concerning, are objectively describing a risk.  There's no effort to amplify the perceived threat unduly.  So, I can confidently answer \""no\"" to Q2.  Now, I'll move on to Q3.\n""}, {""Q"": 3, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""The segment does not contain any moderate verbs from the specified list paired with explicit scale or impact information."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**Q3 Analysis: Evaluating \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\""**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My task is to apply Q3 of the decision tree to the phrase: \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"" First, I need to isolate the verbs. I see \""is\"" and \""can occur.\"" Now, I mentally compare these against the list of moderate verbs that trigger Q3 \u2013 things like \""hit,\"" \""surged,\"" or \""feared.\"" Neither \""is\"" nor \""can occur\"" match any of those terms.\n\nNext, I need to evaluate for scale and impact.  \""Rare\"" and \""after close contact\"" are modifiers that describe *how* infection might happen, but they don't quantify the impact with the key terms the decision tree is looking for.  So, no. This doesn't trigger Q3. Therefore, the answer is \""no.\"" I'm now ready to move onto Q4.\n""}, {""Q"": 4, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain a question."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**Evaluating for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, I'm taking a look at this text segment, and I need to assess it against criterion Q4. That's the one checking for loaded rhetorical questions designed to induce alarm. I'm focusing specifically on whether this segment presents a question, especially one that's rhetorically loaded.\n\nThe segment itself is pretty straightforward: \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"" I've read it a couple of times. It's a declarative statement, not a question at all. There's no interrogative form, no question mark, and no implied question.\n\nTherefore, because there's no question, there's absolutely no possibility of a loaded rhetorical question. My answer to Q4 has to be a definitive \""no\"". The rationale I'll provide is simple and direct: the segment doesn't contain a question. That's the end of it.\n""}, {""Q"": 5, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""The segment states that infection is 'rare' but lacks explicit calming language or an intensified low-risk evaluation required for Q5."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**Assessing Reassurance in the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I'm being asked to analyze the phrase \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal\"" against Q5, which I understand focuses on explicit calming cues. My initial thought is to break this down logically.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the segment itself. It's essentially saying that infection is uncommon, but it *can* happen through close contact. Now, I have to compare that to the established Q5 criteria. The guidelines for Q5 include explicitly reassuring phrases, confidence statements, and indications of safety or preparedness. Things like \""no cause for alarm,\"" \""safe to eat,\"" or \""risk is very low\"" are typical examples.\n\nLooking at the segment, \""rare\"" implies a low frequency, but it doesn't meet the intensifier requirements that Q5 looks for. I'm thinking here about the specific patterns and keywords, the intent to actively minimize concerns. The explicit intensifiers like \""very,\"" \""extremely,\"" or \""exceptionally\"" are critical, and they're absent. The pattern `(risk|likelihood|chance)\\s+...\\s+(?:very|extremely|exceptionally|remarkably)\\s+low` is a key indicator, and it doesn't match here.\n\nI don't see any of the other Q5 calming cues either. There are no assurances of safety, no statements of confidence, and no indications of preparedness. It's simply a factual statement, not an attempt to frame the risk as minimal or to put people at ease.\n\nTherefore, considering the explicit reassurance criteria, I have to conclude that this segment *does not* meet the Q5 requirements, so the answer is \""no.\""\n""}, {""Q"": 6, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""The segment uses 'rare' but lacks a specified minimiser token (only, just, merely, a single, few) and an explicit scale contrast."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**Evaluating for Reassurance: Q6 - Minimizer + Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this statement: \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"" The task is to see if it satisfies Q6, which is all about the \""Minimizer + Scale Contrast\"" pattern used for reassurance.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence. I see the word \""rare,\"" which suggests low frequency. However, I need to be *very* specific here, and the rules are clear: I'm looking for the *exact* minimizer tokens.  \""Rare\"" isn't on that list. So, right off the bat, that's a potential issue.\n\nNext, I scan for any *scale contrast*.  Now, that's where you would usually see something like a comparison - *rare compared to...* or *rare in relation to...* But there's nothing like that here. No numbers, no larger group, no clear point of reference for the \""rare\"" claim.\n\nSo, Q6 requires *both* a specific minimizer *and* a scale contrast.  Since the statement only uses a non-specific minimizer, and lacks any sort of scale contrast, I have to conclude that Q6 is *not* satisfied. The answer is a clear \""no\"" in this case, based on the strict criteria. It's just not meeting the necessary conditions.\n""}, {""Q"": 7, ""answer"": ""yes"", ""rationale"": ""'Human infection is rare' is a bare negation/downplaying statement without an explicit calming cue."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**Q7 Analysis: \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\""**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My task is to evaluate the phrase \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"" against Q7. Q7's concern is about \""bare negations\"" - phrases that downplay a risk or negative event without providing any explicit reassurance or calming context.\n\nFirst, I identified the key segment: \""Human infection is rare.\"" This instantly jumps out at me as a potential bare negation. The word \""rare\"" is functionally similar to saying something is \""unlikely\"" or \""not expected to occur frequently.\""  It's a way of diminishing the perceived frequency of an event. My prior knowledge (and the Q7 examples) tells me that these kinds of frequency/likelihood statements are often flagged as potential \""bare negations.\"" Think of examples like \""unlikely to affect consumers\"" or \""doesn't pose a risk.\""\n\nNow, I need to check for a calming cue. Did the text explicitly reassure the audience *after* stating that human infection is rare? No. Instead, it immediately follows with \""but can occur after close contact with an infected animal,\"" which qualifies the previous statement by acknowledging a specific circumstance where infection *is* possible. This doesn't reassure; it just provides more information.\n\nTherefore, \""Human infection is rare\"" functions as a bare negation. It downplays the risk of infection without providing any explicit calming language like \""so there's no need to worry\"" or \""meaning the public is safe.\"" This aligns perfectly with the criteria for Q7.\n\n**My conclusion:** Yes, the segment \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"" contains a bare negation without an explicit calming cue. Specifically, the phrase \""Human infection is rare\"" functions as a bare negation. This leads to a Neutral frame.\n""}]"
