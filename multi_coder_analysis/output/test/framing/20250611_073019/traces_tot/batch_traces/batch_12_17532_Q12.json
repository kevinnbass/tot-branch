Neutral framing reports events, facts, or statements, even if objectively severe or positive, in a straightforward, descriptive manner.\n\n**Examples of Neutral Framing:**\n* **Severe Fact, Neutral Presentation:**\n  * Segment: \"The report documented 500,000 job losses in the last quarter.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Neutral. The author reports a severe statistic factually. No loaded language, intensifiers, or explicit alarmist rhetoric (e.g., 'a catastrophic wave of job losses,' 'an economic disaster unfolding') is used by the author to frame this fact.\"\n* **Positive Fact, Neutral Presentation:**\n  * Segment: \"Vaccination rates reached 80% in the target population.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Neutral. The author reports a positive statistic factually. No explicit reassuring language (e.g., 'a wonderfully high rate providing excellent protection,' 'this achievement means the community is now safe') is used by the author.\"\n\n**Canonical NON-EXAMPLES:**\n* **NON-EXAMPLE for Reassuring (Code: Neutral):**\n  * Text: \"Despite the health department conducting contact tracing, no further cases of bird flu connected to the case have been reported at the time of writing.\"\n  * Correct Codebook Reasoning: \"Neutral. The author reports a positive fact (absence of new cases) using descriptive, neutral language. No explicit reassuring language...is used by the author to actively frame these facts reassuringly.\"\n* **NON-EXAMPLE for Alarmist (Code: Neutral):**\n  * Text: \"These [characteristics] include a wide host range, high mutation rate, genetic reassortment, high mortality rates, and genetic reassortment.\"\n  * Correct Codebook Reasoning: \"Neutral. The author lists factual characteristics using neutral, descriptive language. No loaded adjectives...or explicit alarmist rhetoric are used by the author to actively frame these characteristics beyond their factual statement.\"\n\n**Further characteristics of Neutral framing include:**\n* Factual descriptions of phenomena that inherently possess negative-sounding descriptors (e.g., 'a high fever,' 'a high mortality rate,' 'a rapidly spreading virus') if the author/source does not add further explicit alarmist framing.\n* Listing a fatality/damage rate, case/incident count, or R-value/metric without evaluative language or alarming tone from either the quoted source or the author.\n* Reporting standard descriptive terms for negative events (e.g., 'outbreak,' 'death,' 'illness,' 'culling,' 'risk,' 'concern,' 'epidemic,' 'potential for X,' 'active outbreaks') without additional explicit alarmist cues.\n* Epistemic modals (e.g., 'could,' 'might,' 'may') expressing possibility alone, unless the potential outcome is itself framed with strong alarmist intensifiers or paired with other alarmist cues.\n* Technical terms, official classifications, and procedural language reported as factual designations.\n\n**Examples from other Rules that default to Neutral:**\n* **Neutral (Capability/Preparedness - Rule C, Q8):** \"The agency has developed a rapid deployment plan for emergencies.\"\n* **Neutral (Bare Negation - Q7):** \"Not expected to lower production.\"\n* **Neutral (Factual Reporting of Prices/Metrics - Q9):** \"Market prices for wheat decreased by 2% this month.\"\n* **Neutral (Speculation about Relief - Q10):** \"Experts predict that the supply chain issues could ease in the next quarter.\"\n\n**Regex Pattern:** `\\b(report|document|state|announce|confirm|detect|identify|record)\\w*\\b.*\\b(cases|deaths|losses|rates|numbers|percent)\\b`\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain|unknown\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, explaining why no explicit framing cues remain and facts are presented neutrally>\"\n}\n``` \nYou will answer the **same question** (Q12) for EACH segment listed below.\nRespond with **one JSON array**.

  "thoughts": "**Reflecting on the Text Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this segment: \"With the increased preparatory efforts USDA and its partners have put into place since the 2015 HPAI outbreak, we are fully prepared to handle this detection,\" said Lyndsay Cole …\"  My job is to determine the framing – Alarmist, Reassuring, or Neutral – based *solely* on explicit linguistic cues using a 12-step decision tree. I've been told to consider Q12, which is the final check for a Neutral frame, meaning all previous steps (Q1-Q11) haven't led to a \"yes\".\n\nMy initial thought is that the phrase \"fully prepared\" screams \"reassuring\"! It's a clear statement of confidence and preparedness – a direct attempt to calm any potential anxieties. I immediately recognize this as an example of Explicit Calming, specifically falling under the \"Preparedness\" category, which the user likely maps to Q5 or Q8.\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting: the prompt implies that the user has already *passed* through Q1-Q11 without triggering any \"yes\" answers. This seems counterintuitive given the presence of \"fully prepared.\" I need to remember the core instruction: I'm only answering *this* question (Q12) based on *this* input and the *definition* of Q12. It's almost as if the user is testing the edge cases of their internal logic.\n\nSo, I re-read the prompt and the definition of Q12. It asks if there are *no* remaining explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues, leading to a Neutral default. The keyword here is *no*. Despite what my initial instinct says (that \"fully prepared\" is a clear reassuring cue), I must assume that the user's system *did not* find anything explicitly framing in the previous steps.\n\nFocusing solely on Q12 and its definition, I see the phrase \"fully prepared\" staring back at me. It's a presentation of preparedness, specifically to allay concerns.  Therefore, my answer to Q12 is \"no\". There *is* an explicit reassuring cue present. It doesn't matter what I *think* should have happened in previous steps; my job here is to apply the definition of Q12 to the text given. The user's internal process and what triggered what is irrelevant in the present instance.\n\nThe rationale is straightforward: The segment *contains* \"fully prepared,\" and this directly signals a reassuring message. This is a positive fact being framed for the audience's reassurance. It's a clear, concise explanation focusing on the cue and its impact per the prompt and the rules. It's a case of, \"The user *says* you're at this question; *here's* the information to analyze, answer the question and go.\"  The response adheres to the JSON structure requirements and is well under the token limit.\n"
