The focus is on the *future possibility*, not a *present reassurance*.\n\n**Examples:**\n* **Neutral:** \"Experts predict that the supply chain issues could ease in the next quarter.\"\n* **Neutral:** \"There is hope that a new treatment may be available next year.\"\n* **Contrast with Reassuring:** If the statement was \"Because these measures are working, restrictions may be short-lived, bringing welcome relief soon,\" the \"because these measures are working\" part, if framed as active present control, might shift it towards Reassuring, depending on potency.\n\n**Critical Distinction:**\n- **Future-focused language alone** = Neutral speculation\n- **Future relief + present safety/control framing** = Potentially Reassuring\n- The key is whether current conditions are explicitly framed as providing present reassurance\n\n**Common Future-Oriented Language (Neutral unless paired with current reassurance):**\n- Modal verbs: \"may,\" \"might,\" \"could,\" \"should\"\n- Predictive language: \"expect to,\" \"predict,\" \"forecast,\" \"anticipate\"\n- Hopeful expressions: \"hope for,\" \"optimistic about,\" \"looking forward to\"\n- Timeline indicators: \"next quarter,\" \"soon,\" \"in the coming months,\" \"eventually\"\n\n**Boundary Analysis:**\nThe segment must speculate about *future* improvement or relief.

  "thoughts": "**My Analysis of Q10 and the Provided Segment**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to apply Q10 to this segment: \"With the increased preparatory efforts USDA and its partners have put into place since the 2015 HPAI outbreak, we are fully prepared to handle this detection,\" said Lyndsay Cole …  Let's see, Q10 is about spotting speculation about *future* relief without any calming cues about the *present*.\n\nMy initial thought is that this segment doesn't quite fit the bill. The key phrase \"we are fully prepared\" sounds pretty clear about the *current* state. Q10 is looking for something where they're *implying* future improvement without explicitly calming us down right now.\n\nAccording to my understanding of Q10, we'd need to see something more along the lines of \"We *will* be able to handle this eventually...\" or \"We *hope* to be ready...\" - something that points to the future without giving a sense of present control. This is the opposite.\n\nBecause this statement clearly and explicitly reassures us about the *current* situation, it doesn't meet the conditions for Q10. I'd actually lean towards coding this as \"Reassuring\" under Q5 (Explicit Calming - Preparedness), since it's a direct statement of present readiness.\n\nMy final answer is \"no\".\n"
