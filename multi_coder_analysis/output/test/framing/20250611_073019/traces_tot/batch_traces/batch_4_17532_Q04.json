Cues: 'system collapsing,' 'truly feel safe anymore?' - rhetorical question implying no).\n  * **Non-Example (Neutral):** Author: \"What are the safety protocols in place?\" (Information-seeking).\n* Use of loaded rhetorical questions by the quoted source or author that are designed to evoke fear, urgency, or strong concern by implying a severe problem or a dire lack of action.\n  * Example (Author-driven): 'How many more animals have to die before we finally act decisively?' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The rhetorical question uses emotive language 'have to die' and implies criticism of inaction, framing the situation as urgent and severe.)\n  * Example (Quote-driven): 'The activist asked, \"Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?\"' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The quoted rhetorical question uses 'disaster unfolds' to frame the situation alarmingly.)\n  * **Example (Rhetorical question from author implying worry):** Author: \"With new variants emerging rapidly, should humans be worried about the next pandemic?\" → Alarmist (if the context suggests this is not a simple information request but a way to frame emerging variants as a worrisome threat).\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – Loaded Q** | \"Should consumers be worried about buying eggs?\" | **Alarmist** | Loaded rhetorical question implying worry |\n\n**Regex Pattern:** `\\b(?:should|can|could|will)\\s+\\w+\\s+(?:be\\s+)?(?:worried|concerned)\\b`\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` \nYou will answer the **same question** (Q4) for EACH segment listed below.\nRespond with **one JSON array**.

  "thoughts": "**My Expert Assessment of Alarmist Framing: Q4 - Loaded Rhetorical Question**\n\nOkay, I've received the task and have a clear understanding of the requirements. I'm being asked to meticulously examine several text segments, each identified by a unique ID, and determine whether they contain a \"Loaded Rhetorical Question\" designed to instill fear or urgency, which is part of the Alarmist frame. My output must be a JSON array, a format I'm quite familiar with, containing my evaluations, including the rationale behind each \"yes\" or \"no\" answer.\n\nI've carefully considered the rule for Q4: Is there a loaded rhetorical question that implies an Alarmist frame? I need to be particularly vigilant for questions that are designed to worry the audience or suggest a threatening scenario.\n\nI've now proceeded through each segment methodically:\n\n*   **Segment 1, 3 (IDs: seg\\_v5\\_017\\_1003\\_chunk0, seg\\_v5\\_9\\_1002\\_chunk0):** These segments describe supply and demand factors, along with the impact of the pandemic. No questions are present. Therefore, \"no\" is the answer for Q4.\n*   **Segment 2 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_15\\_1000\\_chunk0):** This segment also provides information about the impact of disease, alongside labor shortages and the pandemic. No questions are present. Therefore, \"no\" is the answer for Q4.\n*   **Segment 4 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_20\\_1005\\_chunk0):** This segment provides a quote from a government official. There's no hint of a loaded rhetorical question within the quote. Therefore, \"no\" is the answer for Q4.\n\nBased on my expert analysis, none of these segments meet the criteria for Q4. The output, formatted as a JSON array as requested, will reflect this conclusion. I have the necessary information to assemble the output now.\n"
