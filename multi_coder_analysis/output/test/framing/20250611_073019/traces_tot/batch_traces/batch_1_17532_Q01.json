The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)\n\n**Clarification on \"deadly,\" \"fatal,\" \"lethal\":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, \"deadly\" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.\n\n**Minimal Pair Examples:**\n* **Neutral:** \"The virus is contagious.\"\n* **Alarmist (Author):** \"The virus is frighteningly contagious, spreading like wildfire.\" (Cue: 'frighteningly,' 'spreading like wildfire').\n\n**New Comparative Minimal Pair Example:**\n* **Alarmist:** \"Scientists warn the virus is becoming deadlier each season.\"\n* **Neutral:** \"Scientists track how the virus becomes more common each season.\"\n\n**⚠ TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  \nA term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. \"lethal dose 50\").  \n**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – Intensifier + adjective** | \"The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.\" | **Alarmist** | \"so deadly\" (intensifier + risk adjective) |\n| **Alarmist – Deadly-from-outset idiom** | \"H5N1 is deadly from the start, vets warn.\" | **Alarmist** | \"deadly from the start\" (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom) |\n\n**Regex Pattern  (v2.16.2):**\n```regex\n # Ignore the fixed scientific term \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\"\n \\b(?:(?:highly(?!\\s+pathogenic\\s+avian(?:\\s+flu|\\s+influenza)?))\n     |very|deadlier|more|extremely|severely|so|particularly|frighteningly)  \n     (?:\\s+\\w+){0,3}\\s+\n # Risk-adj list (adding infectious, transmissible) while pruning ECON adjective \"volatile\"\n (deadly|lethal|dangerous|severe|catastrophic|brutal|contagious|virulent|destructive|infectious|transmissible)\\b|\n # NEW (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom)\n \\bdeadly\\s+from\\s+(?:the\\s+)?(?:start|outset)\\b\n```\n\n**EXCLUSION — \"volatile\"**  \nWhen \"volatile\" modifies *prices/markets/rates* it is treated as an **economic metric** (see Q9) and never triggers Q1.\n\n> **Technical-term guard** – \"highly pathogenic\" used as part of the formal\n> disease name (HPAI) is **Neutral** unless further alarmist cues appear.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` \nYou will answer the **same question** (Q1) for EACH segment listed below.\nRespond with **one JSON array**.

  "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Risk Intensification**\n\nOkay, I've got the task. The instructions are clear: analyze these six text segments and determine if they trigger Q1 of the decision tree. That means I need to identify if any of them contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\". I'll be outputting a JSON array with `segment_id`, `answer` (yes/no), and `rationale` for each one. Let's dive in.\n\n*   **Segment 1 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_017\\_1003\\_chunk0):**  This one's a straight 'no'. No intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk adjectives, and no actual risk adjectives either. It just describes market conditions neutrally.\n*   **Segment 2 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_4\\_100\\_chunk0):** Bingo! \"So infectious and deadly\" hits the mark perfectly. \"So\" is an intensifier, and both \"infectious\" and \"deadly\" are risk adjectives. This is a clear \"yes,\" with the rationale quoting that phrase.\n*   **Segment 3 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_15\\_1000\\_chunk0):**  Another \"no\". No intensifiers modifying risk adjectives here, and no risk adjectives present. It's just describing market issues.\n*   **Segment 4 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_9\\_1002\\_chunk0):** Identical to Segment 1, so the answer is also \"no.\" No intensifiers, comparatives, or risk adjectives.\n*   **Segment 5 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_20\\_1005\\_chunk0):**  Definitely a \"no.\"  While it touches on preparation, it doesn't involve any intensifiers on risk words. This looks more like a Q4 cue.\n*   **Segment 6 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_11\\_1006\\_chunk0):**  \"Highly transmissible\" is a winner! \"Highly\" is the intensifier, and \"transmissible\" is a clear risk adjective. Another \"yes,\" with the rationale again quoting the phrase.\n\nAlright, that's all of them. I've got my answers and rationales. Now I just need to format the data into the requested JSON array. Easy peasy.\n"
