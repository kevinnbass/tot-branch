The negation alone is insufficient for Reassuring framing.\n\n\n\n**Key Principle:** A bare negation simply denies or downplays a risk/problem factually. To become Reassuring, it needs an additional linguistic layer that explicitly interprets this negation as a reason for calm or safety.\n\n**Examples:**\n* **Neutral (Bare Negation):** \"Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe.\"\n* **Reassuring (Bare Negation + Calming Cue):** \"Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe, meaning current health measures remain effective and there's no need for additional public concern.\"\n\n### Additional example\n* \"The cases **do not present an immediate public-health concern**.\" → Neutral (bare negation).\n\n**CLARIFICATION** – \"will **not** enter the food system\" and similar bare-negation\nstatements remain **Neutral** unless followed by an explicit calming cue\n(e.g., \"…so consumers can rest easy\").

  "thoughts": "**Analyzing Segments for Bare Negation (Q7)**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've been tasked with applying Question 7 of the decision tree – specifically the 'bare negation' check – to four different text segments. The goal is to determine if each segment contains a simple, unmitigated negative statement, like \"not expected\" or \"will not.\" If it does, the frame is Neutral; if not, we move on (though I don't need to worry about that here).\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** \"The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"  Reading this, I'm thinking, \"No, this doesn't have any bare negations.\" It's describing current negative situations – the disease, supply issues, and shortages. It's not *negating* anything, just stating the reality.  Therefore, Q7 is a \"no\" for this segment.\n\n*   **Segment 2:** \"The flu outbreaks are hitting the country at a time when poultry market supplies have dropped due to the COVID-19 pandemic and labor shortages.\"  My instinct tells me, \"Nope, still no bare negation.\" It's very similar to the first segment. We have outbreaks and supply drops, which are negative, but not framed as negations of a future or possible positive outcome. So, \"no\" to Q7 here as well.\n\n*   **Segment 3:** \"The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"  Wait a minute, this is a repeat of Segment 1! My conclusions are the same as Segment 1. So, \"no\" to Q7 here.\n\n*   **Segment 4:** \"\"With the increased preparatory efforts USDA and its partners have put into place since the 2015 HPAI outbreak, we are fully prepared to handle this detection,\" said Lyndsay Cole …\" Here, I'm thinking, \"Hold on, this is different.\" While this segment discusses a negative event, the focus is on being *prepared*.  \"Fully prepared\" indicates reassurance, specifically Q5. No, there's no bare negation here either. Q7 is a \"no\".\n\nSo, the result is clear. For *all* the segments, Q7 is a \"no.\" There were no instances of 'bare negation.' I'm happy to provide the JSON array with these results when ready.\n"
