(Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: \"The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%.\" (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).\n* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: \"Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds.\" (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').\n\n**Key Principle:** \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" \"plummeted\" can be potent verbs on their own (see Q2) if used dramatically.

  "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Impact**\n\nOkay, I've got it. My task is to go through four text segments and determine if they meet the criteria for Q3 of the decision tree. That means I'm looking for \"moderate verbs\" paired with clear indicators of scale or impact. I've got my lists ready: verbs like *hit*, *swept*, *surged* and so on, and impact indicators like `\\d`, *million*, *thousands*, and terms like *record* and *devastating*. Crucially, the verbs need to describe *realized* impact, not just a potential or planned effect. Plain verbs by themselves, like *killed* or *affected*, are out unless they're partnered with some kind of quantifying term.\n\nFor the first segment, \"The disease is hitting the market...\", the verb *hitting* is on the list. But the impact is described as \"the market,\" which doesn't fit the criteria for a scale indicator. So, no.\n\nSegment two, \"The flu outbreaks are hitting the country...\", suffers from the same problem. *Hitting* is there, but \"the country\" doesn't quantify impact. No again.\n\nSegment three is a duplicate of segment one, and so yields the same negative result.\n\nFinally, segment four, with the USDA quote, doesn't even use any of the moderate verbs from my list to describe the disease's impact. It's all about preparedness and handling, which I'll categorize under different parts of the decision tree. It's a clear \"no\" for Q3.\n\nSo, it's a clean sweep: all four segments will receive a \"no\" for Q3, and I'll package that information into JSON arrays for each.\n"
