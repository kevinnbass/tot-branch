Context and the 'Principle of Cue Sufficiency' are key.)**\n\n**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**\n* Authorial use of vivid, active verbs or metaphors to describe the spread or impact of a threat, especially when combined with its scale or severity, thereby emphasizing its uncontrolled, rapid, or overwhelming nature. Example: Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)\n\n**Alarmist - Examples:**\n* \"The economic impact of the subject on the agricultural sector is a ticking time-bomb for food security,\" said the analyst. (Alarmist → The analyst's quote uses a potent metaphor \"ticking time-bomb,\" framing the economic impact with fear/urgency.)\n* Author: \"Political inaction is steering us towards a catastrophic crisis related to the subject.\" (Alarmist → Author's framing of political aspect through loaded language like \"catastrophic crisis,\" assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Author-driven, vivid metaphor & intensifier):**\n  * Author: \"The virus is a raging inferno, tearing through populations with terrifying speed, leaving devastation in its wake.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses vivid metaphor 'raging inferno,' 'tearing through,' 'terrifying speed,' and 'devastation in its wake.' Decisive cues: 'raging inferno,' 'terrifying speed'.\"\n* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: \"The disease ravaged poultry flocks across three states, leading to immense economic losses.\" (Alarmist → 'Ravaged' + 'across three states' + 'immense economic losses' create a strong alarmist frame).\n* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: \"Confirmed cases soared past one million, overwhelming healthcare systems.\" (Alarmist → 'Soared past one million' + 'overwhelming healthcare systems' creates a strong alarmist frame).\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – High-potency verb** | \"An outbreak ravaged farms across three states.\" | **Alarmist** | \"ravaged\" (vivid, destructive verb) |\n| **Alarmist – Superlative-negative-noun** | \"The H5N1 wave is now considered the most expensive animal-health disaster in U.S. history.\" | **Alarmist** | \"most expensive...disaster\" (superlative + negative noun) |\n| **Alarmist – Critical alert phrase** | \"State authorities remain on high alert for new cases.\" | **Alarmist** | \"on high alert\" (critical alert phrase) |\n\n**Boundary guard:** If the verb is \"hit / hitting / swept / surged\" but the segment gives no numbers, adjectives or metaphors that convey magnitude, treat it as Neutral.

  "thoughts": "**Evaluating Text Segments Against Q2 Criteria**\n\nOkay, I've got the task. The user wants me to run four text segments through Q2 of the decision tree. That means I need to identify if any segment uses a high-potency verb or metaphor, a superlative + negative noun, or a critical alert phrase. Let's break down my thought process:\n\n*   **Segment 1, 2, and 3:** These three segments are very similar. They all contain the verb \"hitting.\" I know from my experience with this type of analysis that \"hitting\" can be tricky. My initial instinct is to look at context. Following the established rules, it's categorized as a \"moderate verb\". I need to be sure that the provided context isn't elevating it to \"high-potency\". After carefully reviewing the Q2 Pattern Recognition Table and the Detailed Rules, I can confirm that the context of \"supplies down\" and \"labor shortages\" doesn't change \"hitting\"s status. So, no on all three criteria (verb, metaphor, alert phrase/noun) for these segments.\n*   **Segment 4:** This segment is about preparation. There are no high-potency verbs or metaphors here. While it does mention \"fully prepared\", this is a Q5 cue and not relevant to Q2. It's a \"no\" again.\n\nEssentially, after thorough review, my conclusion is that none of the segments meet the Q2 criteria. Now, I'll format the output as a JSON array as requested.\n"
