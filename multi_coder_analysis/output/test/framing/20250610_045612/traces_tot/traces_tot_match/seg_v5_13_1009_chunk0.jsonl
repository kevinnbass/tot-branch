{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states birds were 'infected', which is a factual condition, but it does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Evaluation: A Clear \"No\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to evaluate against the first question of this 12-step claim framing decision tree. The segment is: \"In a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\" Q1 wants me to see if there's an intensifier or a comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nI've got this down cold, I know the drill. I'll break it down piece by piece: \"In a statement released last week\" - completely neutral. \"Tyson Foods confirmed\" - again, neutral. Now, \"that its birds were infected.\"  Aha! We're dealing with a negative here, \"infected\" - that's a negative condition. And finally, \"in Fulton County.\"  Just a location.\n\nNow, does \"infected\" fit as a \"risk-adjective\" in the context of this 12-step tree? Well, it's a negative condition, but it's not a word like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" or \"severe,\" which are what Q1 is specifically looking for. Even if it *were* a risk-adjective (and I'm leaning toward 'no' here), there's *nothing* modifying it! No \"very,\" no \"more,\" no \"extremely.\" It's just a straight, factual statement: \"birds were infected.\"\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding of this decision tree, the criteria for Q1 are simply not met. The answer is a clear \"no.\" My rationale for the user in the JSON will be based on the lack of the criteria for Q1 being met. I will state the text states the birds were infected, and it's not modified by an intensifier/comparative and that \"infected\" itself is not explicitly listed as a risk-adjective triggering Q1. The core issue is the lack of intensification/comparison. I'll move on to crafting that now."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('confirmed', 'infected') and lacks high-potency verbs, metaphors, or other Q2 cues.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm taking a look at this text segment, \"In a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County,\" and need to assess it against Q2 of the framing analysis decision tree. That means I'm looking for evidence of alarming framing – specifically, high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, negative superlatives, or the phrase \"on high alert.\"\n\nScanning the text, the verbs jump out first. \"Confirmed\" is definitely neutral, a basic reporting verb. \"Infected\" is factual, describing the *state* of the birds, but not dramatizing the event itself. It doesn't use the kind of amplified language Q2 is looking for, like \"ravaged\" or \"crippling.\"\n\nNext, I checked for metaphors, but nothing stands out as a strong image that exaggerates the situation. And there are no negative superlatives – nothing like \"the worst disaster.\"  Finally, the \"on high alert\" phrase isn't there.\n\nSo, the language is pretty straightforward and objective, just reporting the facts. No red flags for alarmist framing here. Therefore, the answer to Q2 is definitely \"no.\" I'd frame the rationale as: \"No high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, negative superlatives, or 'on high alert' found.\" I'm now ready to provide that JSON response."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'were infected' is not on the list of moderate verbs (e.g., swept, hit, soared, plummeted) and no scale or impact information is provided.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Against Question Q3**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm breaking down the analysis of that text fragment against Question Q3 of the decision tree. I'm looking for an \"Alarmist frame,\" which in this case, means a moderate verb combined with significant scale or impact.\n\nFirst, I identified the key phrase: \"Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\" The core of the relevant information is \"were infected\". I need to check whether this phrase constitutes a \"moderate verb\" according to Q3's criteria. Based on the regex rules, which define a specific set of acceptable verbs, it's clear that \"infected\" isn't included.  The list is very specific, and \"were infected\" is more like \"affected\" or \"reported,\" essentially a neutral description of a condition.\n\nNext, I need to see if the text provides any clues about scale or impact.  While it tells us *what* was infected (\"its birds\") and *where* (\"Fulton County\"), there's no data suggesting a substantial scope or consequence. No numbers (e.g., \"thousands,\" \"50%\"), nor phrases denoting significant losses or disruption.\n\nGiven both requirements must be met, but neither is. \"Were infected\" isn't a \"moderate verb,\" and the context lacks any impactful information. Therefore, the answer to Q3 is \"no,\" as I don't see the presence of a moderate verb coupled with significant scale/impact information."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and contains no questions, rhetorical or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Alarmist Rhetoric**\n\nAlright, I've got a text segment: \"In a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\" My task is to evaluate this against Q4, specifically looking for any loaded rhetorical questions designed to imply alarm.\n\nFirst, I dissect the segment. It's a straightforward declarative sentence, a simple fact. No questions are present, let alone rhetorical ones.\n\nComparing this to the criteria for Q4, the absence of any questioning at all is immediately apparent. No hint of \"Should we be worried?\" or anything similar is detectable.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is clear: this segment doesn't contain a loaded rhetorical question.\n\nApplying Q4, because there's no evidence of such rhetoric, the answer is definitively \"no\". I'll format that as a JSON object with a rationale, of course, noting the absence of any questioning, let alone alarmist questioning, within the provided text segment."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (birds infected) neutrally, without any explicit language from the author or source designed to calm concerns or communicate safety.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of Reassuring Cues in the Segment**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze the text segment, \"In a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County,\" specifically in relation to Q5 of the decision tree. Q5, as you know, focuses on identifying explicit calming cues – those statements that directly communicate safety, control, or a minimized present risk.\n\nMy initial assessment is this: the segment reports a negative fact – the infection of birds. It attributes this information to Tyson Foods. I need to determine if this includes any of the specific language patterns we're looking for, those direct safety assurances, preparedness cues, low-risk evaluations, positive amplifications, confidence statements, or bare positive facts that *reassure*.\n\nI've gone through my mental checklist. There are **no** explicit reassuring cues present. There are no direct safety guarantees, no \"we're prepared\" statements, no downplaying of the risk, no attempts to paint a positive picture. It's simply a factual statement, reporting an unfortunate event.\n\nFollowing the SYMMETRY RULE and our definitions, reporting a negative fact neutrally, as this segment does, is considered *Neutral*. It's not *Alarmist* (heightening fear) and it's certainly not *Reassuring*. The question specifically asks about *explicit calming cues*, and this segment contains none.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q5 is \"no\". Now, I'll move on to Q6."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) or a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'among millions').", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to apply Question Q6 to this text: \"In a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\" My task is to determine if it uses the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern for reassurance, as defined in Q6.\n\nFirst, I need to remind myself what I'm looking for. Q6 specifies a minimiser (words like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" etc.) *combined* with a scale contrast (phrases like \"out of thousands,\" \"among millions,\" \"nationwide,\" etc.). That's the key. I can't just find *one* of those elements; I need *both*.\n\nSo, I reread the text, looking for those specific cues.  Does \"In a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County\" contain a minimiser? No. I don't see anything like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely\" anywhere in the segment. Okay, moving on... Is there a scale contrast? Again, no. There's nothing that implies a scale – no \"out of thousands,\" no \"among millions,\" no comparisons to larger numbers or areas.\n\nSince I don't see either the minimiser or the scale contrast, the text obviously doesn't meet the requirements of Q6. Therefore, the answer to Q6 is \"no\".\n\nTo explain my reasoning clearly, I'd say something like: \"The text segment does not employ the 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' pattern because it lacks both a minimiser (e.g., 'only', 'just') and a scale contrast (e.g., 'out of thousands', 'among millions').\" Then, I'd format that into the appropriate JSON structure.  Pretty straightforward."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states that birds 'were infected', which is a factual confirmation of a negative event, not a bare negation or denial of a risk.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this statement from Tyson Foods: \"In a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\" I need to determine if this fits the criteria for Q7: a \"bare negation\" *without* an explicit calming cue. My expert eye immediately scans for those telltale negation words—\"not\", \"no\", \"unlikely,\" or any similar phrasing from my extensive knowledge base.\n\nHmm, this is straightforward. The text clearly states the birds *were* infected. It's a statement of fact, a confirmation of a negative finding, but it doesn't utilize any of the negation patterns I'm looking for. There's no \"not expected,\" no \"unlikely occurrence,\" no \"negative tests\" here. Furthermore, there's no attempt to soften or diminish the negative implication.\n\nSince the segment lacks a bare negation in the first place, it's a simple \"no\" for Q7. I'll move on to the next task."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a factual confirmation of infection; it does not describe capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Question Q8**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment: \"In a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\" My task is to assess if it aligns with the criteria of Q8 in the decision tree. Q8 is all about identifying statements that describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, *but* without directly connecting them to current safety or minimized risk.\n\nLet's break it down. Does this segment present any of those things? Hmm... no. It doesn't describe *capabilities*, like \"we *can* do X.\" No mention of *preparedness* measures that were taken. No *hopeful possibilities* for the future are painted here. And certainly, no *safeguards* are presented. This isn't about officials working to contain anything, nor is it about vaccines or pre-existing systems.\n\nThis is simply a straightforward, factual statement. It's a report of something that *already happened*: the confirmation of infection. It's a statement of a negative condition, not a description of any forward-looking action, preparation, or hopeful scenario.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q8 is definitively \"no\". I should now move onto the next question in the tree (which, based on the instructions, is Q9). My output will reflect this \"no\" answer, complete with this rationale."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not report prices, economic data, or numerical metrics.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to assess this segment: \"In a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\" against Q9 of the decision tree. Q9, as I recall, is about identifying segments that *primarily* report prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using specific, neutral language. And it explicitly *excludes* segments that use vivid verbs, risk adjectives, or any explicit framing.\n\nReading this, I immediately see that this is about a confirmation from Tyson Foods regarding infected birds.  It's not about prices, economic indicators, or any quantifiable metrics. My initial thought is that this clearly *doesn't* fit Q9. It's reporting a specific event, not economic data.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q9 has to be a firm \"no\". The rationale here is straightforward: the segment doesn't report any economic data or numerical metrics. It's a statement about an outbreak, plain and simple. We are simply not looking at economic reporting here."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a past confirmation of current/past infection and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of Segment Regarding Potential Future Relief**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"In a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\" My task is to evaluate this against Question Q10 of the decision tree. Q10 is pretty straightforward: does this speculate about future relief or improvement *without* any calming cues about the present?\n\nLet's break it down. The segment describes a past action (\"statement released last week\") and a past/current fact (\"birds were infected\"). I'm looking for language that hints at future possibilities: maybe a prediction of things getting better, a timeline for recovery, or even just a glimmer of hope. But, I'm not seeing any of that. This is purely reporting a confirmed fact, albeit a concerning one.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that this segment *doesn't* speculate about future relief or improvement. My answer to Q10 is a resounding \"no.\" I'll need to pass this along as the current information point, and await Q11."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The attributed statement from Tyson Foods ('its birds were infected') is a neutral report of a negative fact, lacking explicit alarmist or reassuring language.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of Q11**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text, \"In a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County,\" and need to apply Q11 from the decision tree. My initial step is to identify the directly quoted source, which is clearly \"Tyson Foods confirmed.\"  Now, I'm examining the quoted language itself: \"its birds were infected in Fulton County.\"\n\nI'm looking for either Alarmist or Reassuring framing cues.  \"Infected\" is a neutral descriptor, simply stating a negative fact. It's not amplified by any intensifiers or vivid verbs.  Similarly, there's no language indicating calm or reassurance.\n\nSince the statement is factual and devoid of framing language, my conclusion is that it does not provide a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame.  Therefore, the answer to Q11 is \"no.\"  I'll need to proceed to the next question, Q12, in the tree.\n\nMy confidence in this analysis is high, a 5/5, as I've meticulously followed the rules and considered all relevant aspects of the question."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Segment reports a negative fact (infection) using neutral, factual language without explicit framing cues.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment: This is a Neutral Frame**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text: \"In a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\" My task is to analyze this through the lens of a 12-step decision tree, starting with Q12. This means I'm looking for a \"Neutral\" frame based on the lack of explicit alarmist or reassuring cues.\n\nFirst, I dissect the segment. \"In a statement released last week\" sets a factual reporting context - nothing inherently framing there. \"Tyson Foods confirmed\" is a neutral verb; it simply relays information. Then, \"its birds were infected in Fulton County\" is the crux. It's a negative fact, yes, but the presentation is critical.\n\nI'm looking for those red flags: intensifiers, vivid verbs, any hint of hyperbole. \"Severely infected\"? \"Ravaged by infection\"? Nope. Nothing like that. No exaggerations, no metaphorical language to amp up the fear. It's just a factual statement of a negative event, devoid of loaded language.\n\nQ12 wants a \"yes\" answer if there are *no* explicit cues.  This reminds me of the \"Severe Fact, Neutral Presentation\" example from my materials. It's like, \"The report documented 500,000 job losses\" - a serious fact, but the way it's presented is purely descriptive.\n\nIn this case, the negative fact is the infection, but the presentation is purely factual and descriptive, like a well-reported statistic. No alarmist embellishments, no calming reassurances. Therefore, according to Q12, the answer is unequivocally \"yes\". The frame is, by default, Neutral. The rationale is the neutral reporting of a negative event."}
