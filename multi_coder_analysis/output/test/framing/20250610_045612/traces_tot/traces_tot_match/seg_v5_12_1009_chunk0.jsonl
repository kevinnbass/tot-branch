{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'highly' modifies the risk-adjective 'lethal'.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"They [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentuckyâ€™s first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\"  My task is to see if this triggers the alarmist frame according to the first question (Q1) of the decision tree. Q1 specifically wants me to look for an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nImmediately, I see \"highly lethal bird flu\".  \"Highly\" is an intensifier, and \"lethal\" is a risk-adjective. This fits the pattern perfectly!  My pattern recognition table and detailed rules list precisely this: \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj\" triggering the alarmist frame. The specific regex `highly\\s+lethal` also confirms this match.\n\nI have to consider the technical term guard which states that \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\" is neutral. However, the text uses \"highly lethal bird flu\", which is not HPAI. The key is \"highly lethal\", which falls squarely under the general rule.  This means the general rule takes precedence.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is definitely \"yes\". The crucial trigger here is \"highly lethal.\" I'm instructed to emit the alarmist frame (because Q1 says so).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The intensifier 'highly' modifies the risk-adjective 'lethal'.\"\n}\n```"}
