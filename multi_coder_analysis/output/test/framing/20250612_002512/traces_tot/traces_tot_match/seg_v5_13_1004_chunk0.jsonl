{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'deadly' is a base risk adjective, not modified by an intensifier or comparative. 'soaring' modifies a background condition."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses factual language ('does not present', 'has the potential', 'threatens to spark'). 'threatens' is not a high-potency verb. 'soaring inflation' is background context."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'threatens to spark shortages' is a potential impact, not a realised one, and 'soaring inflation' is background condition."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a loaded rhetorical question."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'does not present a food safety risk' is a bare negation, not an explicit calming cue like 'safe to eat'."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment lacks both a minimiser token and a scale contrast."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the bare negation 'does not present a food safety risk' without an explicit calming cue."}
