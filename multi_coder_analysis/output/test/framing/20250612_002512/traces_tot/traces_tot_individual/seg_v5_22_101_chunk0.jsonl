{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains the comparative 'more' but it modifies 'pay' (cost), not a risk-adjective like 'deadly' or 'dangerous' as required by Q1.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Framing of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text segment: \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" and I need to determine its framing using a 12-step decision tree. I'm starting at Q1, which seems straightforward enough. It's asking if the segment includes an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nI've got the text in front of me, and right away I see the comparative adjective \"more\". Now, the crucial part is whether \"more\" is modifying a risk-adjective. That's the key.  I know from experience, and from reviewing the instructions, that Q1's definition of \"risk-adjectives\" is pretty specific, focusing on words like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" or \"contagious\" – those adjectives that directly describe the severity or nature of a potential threat.\n\nHere, \"more\" modifies \"pay,\" which is about cost or price. It has nothing to do with describing the severity of a risk.  The provided list of risk-adjectives doesn't include anything related to cost. It's really about the threat itself. So, based on that, the answer to Q1 is definitely \"no\".  The comparative \"more\" doesn't fit the criteria of modifying a risk-adjective according to the decision tree's definition.\n\nI'm confident in this assessment.  Now, I need to format that answer and rationale in JSON.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment asks a question about potential price increases but contains no high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases.", "thoughts": "**Assessing for High-Potency Language**\n\nOkay, I've been given a text segment: \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" and I need to apply Q2 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if this segment contains any high-potency language – specifically, high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative noun phrases, or critical alert phrases.\n\nFirst, I dissect the sentence. The primary verbs are \"expect\" and \"pay.\" While \"pay\" is certainly relevant to cost, neither of these qualify as high-impact verbs like \"devastated,\" \"soared,\" or \"catastrophic.\" Next, I scan for any metaphorical language, but I don't see anything. There are also no superlative and negative nouns, and no obvious red-flag alert phrases.\n\nBased on this analysis, the segment doesn't trigger any of the cues in Q2. Therefore, the answer to Q2 is \"no,\" and I'll proceed to the next question in the decision tree.\n"}

I understand the goal: determine if there's a moderate verb explicitly tied to information about significant scale or impact. Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I identified the text segment. It's clear enough: \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\"\n\nNext, I need to scan for those moderate verbs. I know the list: verbs like \"hit,\" \"surged,\" \"plummeted,\" and so on. Right away, I see there are none of those verbs in this text. It's just a question about expected future costs.\n\nSince there are no moderate verbs, there's absolutely no chance of finding that pairing with information about scale or impact. Those two elements have to be together to answer \"yes\" to this question.\n\nTherefore, the Q3 condition isn't met. The answer is definitively \"no.\" It’s straightforward, really. There’s no ambiguity here.\n\nFinally, I’ll package this up in the requested JSON format, with the \"no\" answer and a quick rationale explaining the absence of the required components.\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The question 'Can I expect to pay more...?' is a neutral, information-seeking question about potential price changes, not a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm or instill fear.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" Against Q4 (Alarmist Rhetorical Questions)**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The task is to evaluate \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" against Q4, which looks for loaded rhetorical questions designed to induce alarm. My expert assessment is as follows:\n\nFirst, the segment to analyze is clearly defined: \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\". The core is a question about potential price changes.\n\nNow, Q4: it's all about identifying rhetorical questions that use alarmist language or imply fear/urgency. We're looking for words like \"worry,\" \"crisis,\" \"disaster,\" or implications that inaction leads to something terrible. We also need to differentiate these from neutral, information-seeking questions.\n\nComparing the segment to Q4's criteria is the crucial step. \"Can I expect to pay more...?\" directly asks about a potential price increase. Yes, price increases can be undesirable, but the question itself doesn't frame it as a \"crisis\" or something to be feared. The phrasing is direct, looking for an answer regarding a possible economic outcome.\n\nWe have Q4's examples to help: \"Should consumers worry?\", \"Are we facing a crisis?\", and the like. Those examples use language that immediately signals alarm. The segment, in contrast, doesn't. It's comparable to the neutral examples Q4 provides, like \"What are the safety protocols?\" - a straightforward request for information. It's asking for a factual prediction or possibility about the price of poultry.\n\nSo, the conclusion is clear. The question \"Can I expect to pay more...?\" doesn't fit Q4's definition of an alarmist rhetorical question. It's simply seeking information about a potential financial impact, in the same way, one might ask about any other potential changes in market prices. My professional judgment is that Q4 is \"no\".\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question about potential price increases and contains no statement or explicit calming cue from an author or source.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Poultry Product Price Inquiry**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this snippet: \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" and I need to assess it against decision tree question Q5.  My immediate thought is, this is pretty straightforward.  Q5 is all about looking for those explicit calming cues – you know, the direct reassurances about safety, confidence-boosting statements, or anything that directly addresses anxieties.\n\nThis little phrase? It's a question about price. It's not *making* any statement, let alone a calming one.  I don't see any authorial voice or cited source.  It's just posing a potential economic concern.  Therefore, and it's almost too easy, the answer to Q5 is definitely \"no\".  Next!\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question about potential price increases and does not contain a minimiser or scale contrast.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment for Reassurance Techniques**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the prompt and have to evaluate it in the context of the decision tree, specifically Q6. My task is to determine if the segment, \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" triggers the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" reassurance strategy.\n\nI need to meticulously examine the segment for two key components: the presence of a minimiser word – think \"only,\" \"just,\" or similar limiting terms – and a clear contrast to a larger scale, like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions.\"\n\nAfter a close read, it's immediately clear that this segment doesn't contain either. It's simply posing a direct question about a potential price change. There's no attempt to minimise the potential cost or frame it within a broader, potentially reassuring context.\n\nTherefore, Q6's criteria are not met. The answer is definitively \"no.\" My rationale would simply reiterate the lack of the necessary minimiser word and contrasting scale within the provided text. It's a straightforward analysis, really.\n"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and does not contain a statement, let alone a bare negation.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to analyze the segment \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" using Q7. My understanding is that Q7 is looking for a 'bare negation' in the text, and without any calming cue. I see that this segment is a question; it's asking about a *possibility* – the possibility of paying more for poultry. It's not actually *stating* anything, let alone a negation.  There's no negative word like \"not\" or \"never,\" nor is there any clear negative implication inherent in the question itself. It's simply inquiring about a future event.\n\nTherefore, Q7's criteria are not met. The answer to Q7 is definitely \"no,\" and I will reflect that in my output, along with this reasoning. Since the answer is no, my internal logic dictates that I proceed to the next question, which I'll handle accordingly.\n"}

My understanding of Q8 is crucial here.  It wants me to look for statements that describe capabilities, future hopes, or safety measures *without* explicitly stating a current state of calm or safety.  It's about *potential* actions or *future* states, not necessarily present risk.\n\nThe phrase is a question about the *future* - the user is asking about potential price increases.  It *doesn't* describe any capabilities, preparedness, hopes, or implemented safeguards.  Therefore, it simply does not fit the pattern Q8 is looking for.\n\nMy conclusion is that this segment *does not* meet the criteria outlined in Q8.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment 'Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?' is a question about a potential future impact (higher prices).

I need to determine if it's primarily reporting prices or metrics using standard descriptive verbs, and if it avoids vivid verbs, risk adjectives, and explicit framing.  Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the phrase is a *question* about future prices, specifically asking if prices will *increase*. It's not actually *reporting* any current or past price information.  It's essentially a query about a future state.  \n\nThen, looking at the verb usage.  I'm not seeing any of those standard descriptive verbs like \"rose,\" \"declined,\" or \"stabilized.\"  Nor are there any vivid verbs, risk adjectives, or framing elements that would indicate something is being hyped or that risk is being highlighted.  Instead, we have the phrase \"expect to pay more,\" which is future-oriented and speculative.\n\nQ9 is specifically focused on reporting using standard descriptive language. This is a question about a potential future, it doesn't align with that. Therefore, my conclusion is that the phrase \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" does *not* satisfy the criteria for Q9. The answer is definitively \"no.\"\n"}

Let's see. Q10 is about whether the segment predicts *future relief or improvement* without any calming indicators about the present.\n\nThis segment is a straightforward question.  It's asking, point blank, if prices are going *up*. That's not about relief or improvement at all! It's about a *potential negative* - an increase in cost.  I'm not looking at a scenario where things get better, so there's no speculation on *relief* or *improvement* in this context.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q10 has to be \"no\". It's not speculating about future relief or improvement.  The question is focused on a potential negative outcome: a price hike. My rationale?  It's not about improvement, it's about a potential decline. Simple.\n"}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "No quotation marks present.", "thoughts": "**Processing the User's Question**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to analyze the phrase \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" using Q11, which looks for framed quotations.  Given my understanding of how Q11 works, I know the first thing I need to check is for quotation marks.  Since Q11 has a \"FAST-EXIT GUARD\" in place for situations like this, I immediately scan the text.  There are *no* quotation marks present. That triggers the FAST-EXIT. So, I have my answer. It's a straight \"no\" because there's no quote. My explanation will be clear: \"No quotation marks present.\"  And then, according to my process, I'd move on to Q12, though I don't actually need to process that right now.

{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment is a neutral question about a potential price increase, lacking explicit alarmist or reassuring framing cues.", "thoughts": "**Final Decision: Neutral Framing**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants me to classify \"Can I expect to pay more for poultry products?\" using the final step, Q12, of the decision tree. It's a straightforward question, asking about a potential negative outcome – higher prices. Now, let's break it down:\n\n*   **No Alarmist Cues:** It doesn't use any of those dramatic intensifiers or vivid verbs I'm looking for to indicate alarm. No \"skyrocketing,\" no \"catastrophic,\" nothing like that. It's just a question.\n*   **No Reassuring Cues:** Similarly, it doesn't try to calm the waters with phrases that minimize risk. No \"don't worry,\" no \"it's unlikely.\" Just the question.\n*   **Not a Fact, but a Question:** It's not a statement of *what is* but a query about *what might be*. That's key.\n*   **Purely Factual Presentation:**  Given that it doesn't use emotion-laden words and doesn't explicitly frame things positively or negatively, the presentation is factual, in the sense that it is a simple question about a future event.\n\nSo, according to the rules, since it's not alarmist or reassuring, and doesn't fit any other category in the prior eleven steps, it defaults to **Neutral** under Q12. It's a neutral question about a potential price increase, and there are no explicit framing cues to suggest anything else.\n"}
