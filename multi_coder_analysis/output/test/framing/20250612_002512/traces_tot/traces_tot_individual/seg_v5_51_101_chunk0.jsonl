{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: Alarmist Language Detected**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to analyze the phrase \"The virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks\" according to the Q1 rule. My understanding is that Q1 looks for instances where an intensifier directly modifies a risk-adjective. In this case, I quickly spot the intensifier \"so\" and the risk-adjective \"contagious\" in the phrase. The pattern is clear: \"so contagious,\" with \"so\" acting directly on \"contagious.\" This definitely fits the bill for an \"Alarmist\" frame. My understanding of the Q1 rule, especially considering the explicit mention of \"so\" and \"contagious,\" confirms this. The cue is clearly \"so contagious.\" I'd say the answer is definitively \"yes\" based on that.\n"}
