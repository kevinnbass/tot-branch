The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)\n\n**Clarification on \"deadly,\" \"fatal,\" \"lethal\":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, \"deadly\" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.\n\n**Minimal Pair Examples:**\n* **Neutral:** \"The virus is contagious.\"\n* **Alarmist (Author):** \"The virus is frighteningly contagious, spreading like wildfire.\" (Cue: 'frighteningly,' 'spreading like wildfire').\n\n**New Comparative Minimal Pair Example:**\n* **Alarmist:** \"Scientists warn the virus is becoming deadlier each season.\"\n* **Neutral:** \"Scientists track how the virus becomes more common each season.\"\n\n**⚠ TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  \nA term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. \"lethal dose 50\").  \n**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – Intensifier + adjective** | \"The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.\" | **Alarmist** | \"so deadly\" (intensifier + risk adjective) |\n| **Alarmist – Deadly-from-outset idiom** | \"H5N1 is deadly from the start, vets warn.\" | **Alarmist** | \"deadly from the start\" (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom) |\n\n**Regex Pattern  (v2.16.2):**\n```regex\n # Ignore the fixed scientific term \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\"\n \\b(?:(?:highly(?!\\s+pathogenic\\s+avian(?:\\s+flu|\\s+influenza)?))\n     |very|deadlier|more|extremely|severely|so|particularly|frighteningly)  \n     (?:\\s+\\w+){0,3}\\s+\n # Risk-adj list (adding infectious, transmissible) while pruning ECON adjective \"volatile\"\n (deadly|lethal|dangerous|severe|catastrophic|brutal|contagious|virulent|destructive|infectious|transmissible)\\b|\n # NEW (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom)\n \\bdeadly\\s+from\\s+(?:the\\s+)?(?:start|outset)\\b\n```\n\n**EXCLUSION — \"volatile\"**  \nWhen \"volatile\" modifies *prices/markets/rates* it is treated as an **economic metric** (see Q9) and never triggers Q1.\n\n> **Technical-term guard** – \"highly pathogenic\" used as part of the formal\n> disease name (HPAI) is **Neutral** unless further alarmist cues appear.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` \nYou will answer the **same question** (Q1) for EACH segment listed below.\nRespond with **one JSON array**.

control zone of confirmed bird flu cases, regular testing is taking place to monitor the health of flocks.\n\n### Segment 2 (ID: seg_v5_9_1004_chunk0)\nA spokesperson from the USDA told FOX Business that the agency recently expanded its wild bird surveillance after the first detection of HPAI in a wild bird in the U.S., and that the surveillance of wild birds ensures that both the agency and the poultry industry are able to enhance biosecurity measures and rapidly respond to reduce the risk of disease spread.\n\n### Segment 3 (ID: seg_v5_10_1004_chunk0)\nThe spokesperson said that bird owners (whether it’s commercial or backyard poultry, or pet or hobby birds), should take some simple steps to protect their birds from the virus:\n\n### Segment 4 (ID: seg_v5_11_1006_chunk0)\nCertain strains of avian flu are highly transmissible between flocks, which are then euthanized to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 5 (ID: seg_v5_12_1006_chunk0)\nThe virus is spread by migratory birds and waterfowl, usually this time of year.\n\n### Segment 6 (ID: seg_v5_13_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods is prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing,' the company said in an emailed statement.\n\n### Segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_14_1006_chunk0)\nPlans include additional restrictions on access to farms and continuing to test each flock for avian influenza before it is processed.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_15_1006_chunk0)\nFarms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_16_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_21_1005_chunk0)\nFederal and state officials are working with the poultry industry and have initiated steps such as an immediate quarantine that restricts movement of poultry and equipment used to move birds in and out of specified perimeters around an infected barn usually around 6 miles initially and eradication of the virus by killing and removing birds at the infection site.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_22_1005_chunk0)\nTesting occurs in the quarantine area of both wild and domestic birds.\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_23_1005_chunk0)\nDisinfection is done to kill the virus [H5N1] at the affected farm and testing is used to confirm it’s free of the virus [H5N1].\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_24_1005_chunk0)\nProducers who want to ensure eligibility for government indemnity payments in case of disaster must have a biosecurity protocol on hand that is updated regularly.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_25_1005_chunk0)\nTo help with that [ensuring eligibility for government indemnity payments/having a biosecurity protocol], the USDA has developed a 14-point biosecurity plan for producers, which is audited yearly and reviewed every two years by state agriculture agencies, Sato said.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID: seg_v5_26_1005_chunk0)\nIn Iowa, a state with 49 million chickens, egg farmers are working with state and federal authorities to keep the disease out of their flocks, said Kevin Stiles, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association and the Iowa Egg Council.\n\n### Segment 16 (ID: seg_v5_27_1005_chunk0)\n“IPA is maintaining open communications specifically related to biosecurity best practices and is offering surveillance testing.\n\n### Segment 17 (ID: seg_v5_28_1005_chunk0)\nWe [IPA] are confident in our producers preparedness and ability to manage their flocks,” he [Kevin Stiles] said.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_21_1007_chunk0)\nThe U.S. was forecast to export 3.4 million tons of chicken meat in 2022, of total global export of 13.4 million tons.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_22_1007_chunk0)\nThe growth in U.S. chicken meat export is partially due to the downturn in exports of chicken meat from the European Union which was caused by avian flu.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_23_1007_chunk0)\nThe USDA says as part of avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working together to provide additional surveillance and testing in regions surrounding where the affected flocks are located.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_24_1007_chunk0)\nThey [federal and state partners] add that anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyards up to the large commercial producers should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_25_1007_chunk0)\nThe Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS) is offering a biosecurity tool kit for poultry producers and a list of cases can be found on its website.\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_26_1007_chunk0)\nThe site currently lists three cases in commercial birds during the current outbreak.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_27_1007_chunk0)\nThis [list of cases] includes commercial turkeys, a mixed-species backyard flock in Fauquier County, Virginia, and the broiler chicken flock in Fulton County, Kentucky, belonging to Tyson foods.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_28_1007_chunk0)\nThis article and its headline were updated to clarify a barn of chickens among a flock of 240,000 birds was infected with bird flu.\n\n### Segment 26 (ID: seg_v5_1_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_2_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA also said HPAI was found in a backyard flock in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_3_1006_chunk0)\nLast week, the presence of HPAI was found in a commercial turkey flock of 30,000 in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_4_1006_chunk0)\nIf the disease spreads to enough farms in a geographic region, it could impact the production of chicken, turkey and eggs, raising consumer prices and impacting exports.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_5_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods said it does not expect the case in Kentucky to impact its overall production.\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_6_1006_chunk0)\nIn 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_7_1006_chunk0)\nThough broiler chickens weren't heavily infected, exports dropped by $1.1 billion, or 26%.\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_8_1006_chunk0)\nEgg exports dropped 13% and turkey 23%.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_9_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA estimated the cost to the federal government was more than $1 billion $879 million to manage the crisis and about $200 million in indemnities for lost birds.\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_10_1006_chunk0)\nThe USDA says avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and that no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.\n\n### Segment 36 (ID: seg_v5_1_1007_chunk0)\nChickens in one barn among a flock of 240,000 birds belonging to Tyson Foods have become infected with a lethal form of bird flu, the company confirmed.\n\n### Segment 37 (ID: seg_v5_2_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery intensifies an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. that involves poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia, and follows the destruction of 29,000 turkeys in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 38 (ID: seg_v5_3_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.\n\n### Segment 39 (ID: seg_v5_4_1007_chunk0)\nThe governmental department added that avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern as a human case of these avian flu viruses has yet to be detected in the U.S.\n\n### Segment 40 (ID: seg_v5_5_1007_chunk0)\nA spokesperson for Tyson Foods told Newsweek one barn among a flock of 240,000 in Kentucky had chickens that tested positive for bird flu.\n\n### Segment 41 (ID: seg_v5_6_1007_chunk0)\nTyson Foods said in a statement to Newsweek: 'We are actively working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.'\n\n### Segment 42 (ID: seg_v5_7_1007_chunk0)\nAlthough the origin of the infection is not known, avian influenza has been found in migratory wild birds, which play a significant role in spreading the disease.'\n\n### Segment 43 (ID: seg_v5_8_1007_chunk0)\nWe are 'prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing,' it [Tyson Foods] added, including 'heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, placing additional restrictions on outside visitors, and continuing our practice of testing all flocks for avian influenza before birds leave the farms.'\n\n### Segment 44 (ID: seg_v5_9_1007_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 700 cases of bird flu in humans have been recorded globally since November 2003.\n\n### Segment 45 (ID: seg_v5_10_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC says that though bird flu can cross species and infect humans, this cross-transmission [bird flu crossing species and infecting humans] is rare.\n\n### Segment 46 (ID: seg_v5_11_1007_chunk0)\nInfection usually occurs as a result of infected birds shedding avian virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces which then gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled.\n\n### Segment 47 (ID: seg_v5_12_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC adds that this [infection via shedding/contact] can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or even possibly dust and a person breathes it [the virus] in, or when a person touches something that has the virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.\n\n### Segment 48 (ID: seg_v5_13_1007_chunk0)\nCross infection also usually occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses.\n\n### Segment 49 (ID: seg_v5_14_1007_chunk0)\nBut, the CDC reports some infections have been identified where direct contact was not known to have occurred.\n\n### Segment 50 (ID: seg_v5_15_1007_chunk0)\nWhen a person is infected with avian flu the resultant illness ranges from mild to severe.\n\n### Segment 51 (ID: seg_v5_16_1007_chunk0)\nIn January, Newsweek reported on a rare case of avian flu crossing over to a human in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Segment 52 (ID: seg_v5_17_1007_chunk0)\nThe U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said at the time that the person in question, who lived in southwest England, had been in close contact with infected birds and there was no evidence of onward transmission.\n\n### Segment 53 (ID: seg_v5_18_1007_chunk0)\nIn addition to avoiding unprotected close contact with birds, the USDA advises that to further offset the risk of cross-transmission of

infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they're considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_15_1009_chunk0)\nNo Americans are recorded to have contracted highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_16_1009_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_1_1008_chunk0)\nTyson Foods says it's ramping up biosecurity measures at its farms after a flock of chicken in Kentucky tested positive for the bird flu.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_2_1008_chunk0)\nTo date, the company is only aware of one affected house at a farm in Fulton County, Kentucky, which is one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for the company.\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_3_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this week, the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed the presence of bird flu in Kentucky and Virginia, reigniting fears of another widespread bird flu outbreak.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_4_1008_chunk0)\nBird flu can cause high mortality rates among birds.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_5_1008_chunk0)\nIn 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states

  "thoughts": "**Claim Framing: Q1 Assessment**\n\nAs a seasoned expert in this field, I approached this task with a keen understanding of claim-framing principles. My objective was to rigorously apply a 12-step decision tree, but I was limited to evaluating each text segment based solely on the criteria outlined in Q1. This initial step focuses on identifying instances of alarmist framing by detecting the presence of an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a \"risk-adjective,\" or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\"\n\nMy workflow was systematic: I meticulously examined each text segment, keeping the criteria and the technical-term guard (especially regarding \"highly pathogenic\" and \"volatile\") at the forefront. The process involved a careful analysis of each phrase to determine if it satisfied the Q1 rule. My responses were binary (\"yes\" or \"no\"), accompanied by concise, 80-token rationales, and the JSON output was generated.\n\nI've identified three segments as matching the Q1 pattern, thereby indicating an alarmist frame: Segment 4 (\"highly transmissible\"), Segment 69 (\"highly lethal\"), and Segment 94 (\"highly contagious\"). In all other cases, I answered \"no\" because either an intensifier/comparative was not present or the adjectives in question did not meet the definition of a risk-adjective according to the provided list and rule, or where technical term guard was triggered.\n"
