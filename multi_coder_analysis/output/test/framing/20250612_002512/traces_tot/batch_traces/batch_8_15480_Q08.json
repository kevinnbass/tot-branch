Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\n\n### Segment 2 (ID: seg_v5_8_1006_chunk0)\nEgg exports dropped 13% and turkey 23%.\n\n### Segment 3 (ID: seg_v5_9_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA estimated the cost to the federal government was more than $1 billion $879 million to manage the crisis and about $200 million in indemnities for lost birds.\n\n### Segment 4 (ID: seg_v5_1_1007_chunk0)\nChickens in one barn among a flock of 240,000 birds belonging to Tyson Foods have become infected with a lethal form of bird flu, the company confirmed.\n\n### Segment 5 (ID: seg_v5_2_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery intensifies an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. that involves poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia, and follows the destruction of 29,000 turkeys in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 6 (ID: seg_v5_3_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.\n\n### Segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_5_1007_chunk0)\nA spokesperson for Tyson Foods told Newsweek one barn among a flock of 240,000 in Kentucky had chickens that tested positive for bird flu.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_6_1007_chunk0)\nTyson Foods said in a statement to Newsweek: 'We are actively working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.'\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_8_1007_chunk0)\nWe are 'prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing,' it [Tyson Foods] added, including 'heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, placing additional restrictions on outside visitors, and continuing our practice of testing all flocks for avian influenza before birds leave the farms.'\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_9_1007_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 700 cases of bird flu in humans have been recorded globally since November 2003.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_11_1007_chunk0)\nInfection usually occurs as a result of infected birds shedding avian virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces which then gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled.\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_12_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC adds that this [infection via shedding/contact] can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or even possibly dust and a person breathes it [the virus] in, or when a person touches something that has the virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_13_1007_chunk0)\nCross infection also usually occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_15_1007_chunk0)\nWhen a person is infected with avian flu the resultant illness ranges from mild to severe.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID: seg_v5_16_1007_chunk0)\nIn January, Newsweek reported on a rare case of avian flu crossing over to a human in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Segment 16 (ID: seg_v5_18_1007_chunk0)\nIn addition to avoiding unprotected close contact with birds, the USDA advises that to further offset the risk of cross-transmission of avian flu to humans, poultry and eggs should be cooked to an internal of 165F to kill bacteria and viruses.\n\n### Segment 17 (ID: seg_v5_19_1007_chunk0)\nThese infections [human infections] are concerning for non-health-related reasons, however, especially if more poultry operations in the country are found to be affected.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_20_1007_chunk0)\nAccording to the USDA, the U.S. is the world's top producer of poultry, and number two in terms of exports, following the top exporter Brazil.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_11_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this month, a strain of avian flu was confirmed at a commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_15_1008_chunk0)\nThe agency [USDA] is also reminding consumers that properly prepared and cooked poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees kills bacteria and viruses.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_16_1008_chunk0)\nTyson said its chicken products remain safe for consumers, and it is working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_17_1008_chunk0)\nTo mitigate the spread [of the virus], Tyson is \"heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region and placing additional restrictions on outside visitors and continuing our practice of testing all flocks for avian influenza before birds leave the farms.\"\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_52_101_chunk0)\nMethods include spraying chickens and turkeys with a foam that causes asphyxiation.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_53_101_chunk0)\nIn other cases, carbon dioxide is used to kill the birds, whose carcasses are often composted or placed in a landfill.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_54_101_chunk0)\nIt's [culling] arguably more humane than letting them [birds] die from the virus,' Professor Kean said.\n\n### Segment 26 (ID: seg_v5_55_101_chunk0)\nAvian influenza was discovered at Cold Spring Egg Farm in Palmyra, Wis., forcing the commercial egg producer to destroy nearly three million chickens in March.\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_11_1009_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_13_1009_chunk0)\nIn a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_16_1009_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_1_1008_chunk0)\nTyson Foods says it's ramping up biosecurity measures at its farms after a flock of chicken in Kentucky tested positive for the bird flu.\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_4_1008_chunk0)\nBird flu can cause high mortality rates among birds.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_5_1008_chunk0)\nIn 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_6_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA said it detected the presence of the virus in an undisclosed number of birds from a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_7_1008_chunk0)\nThe agency [USDA] said Monday that \"birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease\" and that \"depopulation is complete in Virginia.\"\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_9_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA is awaiting results of a potential second case about 124 miles northeast in Webster County, Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 36 (ID: seg_v5_10_1008_chunk0)\nMeanwhile, a backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also tested positive for the virus.\n\n### Segment 37 (ID: seg_v5_1_1009_chunk0)\nA \"highly pathogenic\" form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\n### Segment 38 (ID: seg_v5_3_1009_chunk0)\nThe USDA said it is now \"working closely with state animal health officials in New York on a joint incident response,\" according to the statement.\n\n### Segment 39 (ID: seg_v5_4_1009_chunk0)\n\"State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n### Segment 40 (ID: seg_v5_8_1009_chunk0)\n\"As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F kills bacteria and viruses,\" the USDA release on Saturday said.\n\n### Segment 41 (ID: seg_v5_9_1009_chunk0)\n\"As part of existing avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock.\"\n\n### Segment 42 (ID: seg_v5_10_1009_chunk0)\nIt [the detection in New York] came after the virus was discovered in flocks of birds in Kentucky, Virginia, and Indiana.\n\n### Segment 43 (ID: seg_v5_2_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\n\n### Segment 44 (ID: seg_v5_3_1000_chunk0)\nThe latest outbreaks were reported just days after the U.S. ordered nearly 30,000 turkeys to be euthanized in Indiana after testing positive for the same H5N1 strain of the highly pathogenic disease.\n\n### Segment 45 (ID: seg_v5_4_1000_chunk0)\nThe latest outbreaks were reported just days after the U.S. ordered nearly 30,000 turkeys to be euthanized in Indiana after testing positive for the same H5N1 strain of the highly pathogenic disease. That outbreak [in Indiana] was the first case of bird flu found among a commercial poultry flock since 2020.\n\n### Segment 46 (ID: seg_v5_9_1000_chunk0)\nAuthorities believe wild birds have been spreading the virus, after dozens recently tested positive for the flu along the East Coast, Reuters reported.\n\n### Segment 47 (ID: seg_v5_10_1000_chunk0)\nAPHIS urged Americans involved with poultry production from small-scale backyard operations to large commercial environments to review their biosecurity activities and prevent contact between their birds and wild bird populations.\n\n### Segment 48 (ID: seg_v5_12_101_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it [CDC] had been monitoring people in the United States who were exposed to infected poultry and other birds.\n\n### Segment 49 (ID: seg_v5_16_101_chunk0)\nUnder federal guidelines, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, part of the U.S.D.A., is responsible for inspecting all poultry sold in interstate and foreign commerce.\n\n### Segment 50 (ID: seg_v5_17_101_chunk0)\nInspectors are required to be present at all times during the slaughtering process, according to the service, which noted that the inspectors have unfettered access to those facilities.\n\n### Segment 51 (ID: seg_v5_18_101_chunk0)\nEgg-production facilities that are subject to federal regulation are required to undergo daily inspections once per shift, according to the inspection service.\n\n### Segment 52 (ID: seg_v5_19_101_chunk0)\nState inspection programs, which inspect poultry products sold only within the state they were produced, are additionally monitored by the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 53 (ID: seg_v5_20_101_chunk0)\nBecause of the mandated culling of infected flocks, experts say, the virus is primarily an animal health issue at this time.\n\n### Segment 54 (ID: seg_v5_21_101_chunk0)\nStill, the U.S.D.A. recommends cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 Fahrenheit to reduce the potential for food-borne illness.\n\n### Segment 55 (ID: seg_v5_24_101_chunk0)\nRecently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 56 (ID: seg_v5_25_101_chunk0)\nIf infections course through more flocks, experts said, there could be some shortages of eggs.\n\n### Segment 57 (ID: seg_v5_26_101_chunk0)\nPrices for white and dark chicken meat were also rising, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 58 (ID: seg_v5_27_101_chunk0)\nExperts also warned that turkey prices could also become more volatile.\n\n### Segment 59 (ID: seg_v5_28_101_chunk0)\nTesting for the avian flu typically involves swabbing the mouths and tracheal area of chickens and turkeys.\n\n### Segment 60 (ID: seg_v5_29_101_chunk0)\nThe samples are sent to diagnostic labs to be analyzed.\n\n### Segment 61 (ID: seg_v5_30_101_chunk0)\nOutbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_32_101_chunk0)\nThe combined number of birds in the infected flocks -- the commercial and backyard type -- totaled more than 17 million, according to the agency.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_33_101_chunk0)\nA spokesman for the U.S.D.A. confirmed that those birds would be required to be euthanized to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_34_101_chunk0)\nAn commercial egg production facility in Buena Vista County, Iowa, constituted the largest infected flock and was made up of more than 5.3 million chickens, the U.S.D.A. said.\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_36_101_chunk0)\nA commercial poultry flock in New Castle County, Del., was the third-largest infected flock, with more than 1.1 million chickens.\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_39_101_chunk0)\nNearly 50 million birds died, either from the virus or from having to be culled, a majority of them in Iowa or Minnesota.\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_40_101_chunk0)\nThe footprint of the current outbreak, extending from the Midwest and Plains to northern New England, has raised concerns.\n\n### Segment 68 (ID: seg_v5_1_101_chunk0)\nMore than 15 million chickens and turkeys from infected commercial and backyard flocks in 19 states have been killed, officials said.\n\n### Segment 69 (ID: seg_v5_3_101_chunk0)\nIowa has been particularly hard hit, with disasters being declared in some counties and the state canceling live bird exhibits in an order that may affect its famed state fair.\n\n### Segment 70 (ID: seg_v5_4_101_chunk0)\nBetter known as the bird flu, avian influenza is a highly contagious and deadly virus that can prey on chickens, turkeys and wild birds, including ducks and geese.\n\n### Segment 71 (ID: seg_v5_5_101_chunk0)\nIt [Avian influenza] spreads via nasal secretions, saliva and fecal droppings, which experts say makes it [spread] difficult to contain.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_6_101_chunk0)\nSymptoms of the virus include a sudden increase in the mortality of a flock, a drop in egg production and diminished consumption of feed and water.\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_7_101_chunk0)\nThe virus, Eurasian H5N1, is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry.\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_014_1010_chunk0)\nHowever, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_015_1010_chunk0)\nNonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak [of H5N1].\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_016_1010_chunk0)\nNonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak. However, these restrictions [on imports] may be short-lived, as the supply chain crunch for poultry is being felt around the globe, and HPAI viruses have sporadically emerged throughout the world in the past two years.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_41_101_chunk0)\nI think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_42_101_chunk0)\nWhat can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\n\n### Segment 79 (ID: seg_v5_43_101_chunk0)\nAs early as last year, the U.S.D.A. warned of the likelihood of an outbreak of the avian flu and emphasized a hardening of 'biosecurity' measures to protect flocks of chickens and turkeys.\n\n### Segment 80 (ID: seg_v5_44_101_chunk0)\nBiosecurity measures include limiting access to the flocks and requiring farm workers to practice strict hygiene measures like wearing disposable boots and coveralls.\n\n### Segment 81 (ID: seg_v5_45_101_chunk0)\nSharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus.\n\n### Segment 82 (ID: seg_v5_46_101_chunk0)\nSo can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting.\n\n### Segment 83 (ID: seg_v5_48_101_chunk0)\nAt this point, every person producing poultry has to be considering how to improve their biosecurity.'\n\n### Segment 84 (ID: seg_v5_49_101_chunk0)\nIs it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys?\n\n### Segment 85 (ID: seg_v5_50_101_chunk0)\nInfected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 86 (ID: seg_v5_51_101_chunk0)\nThe virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\n\n### Segment 87 (ID: seg_v5_001_1010_chunk0)\nCases of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in Indiana, Virginia, and Kentucky, posing a likely threat to the United States' domestic supply of chicken and turkey this winter.\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)\n#  -----------------------------------------------------------\n✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**\n1.

  "thoughts": "**Summary of My Q8 Analysis for Claim-Framing Coding**\n\nAs an expert coder applying the 12-step decision tree, I've just finished evaluating 87 text segments against Rule Q8: \"Capability/Preparedness Statement without Active Reassurance.\" This task requires careful scrutiny to identify statements describing capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or implemented safeguards, while ensuring these are *not* explicitly linked to current calm, present safety, or substantially minimized risk. The goal is to identify segments framed as Neutral in terms of reassurance.\n\nMy process involved a thorough read of each segment, followed by a series of checks. First, I determined if the segment described capabilities, preparedness, future possibilities, or safeguards. If so, I meticulously assessed whether the text explicitly linked these to current safety or significantly minimized present risk. If a link *wasn't* present, I assigned a \"yes\" to Q8, marking the frame as Neutral, and extracted the crucial cue(s).\n\nFor the 87 segments, I found the following:\n\n*   **Segments that *did* trigger Q8:** \n    *   I identified multiple segments where actions, plans, systems, and advice (even cooking recommendations) were stated without direct reassurance. \n    *   Examples include statements about \"working to prevent the spread,\"  \"heightening biosecurity measures,\"  \"properly prepared and cooked poultry,\" \"euthanizing\" and \"testing.\"\n    *   There were multiple instances of \"biosecurity\" being mentioned, and actions related to that are counted as cue.\n*   **Segments that *didn't* trigger Q8:**\n    *   The majority described facts about outbreaks, impacts, historical data, and transmission mechanisms.\n    *   They did not make an assertion of capabilities/preparedness.\n    *   Some segments contained recommendations or advice without active reassurance. Those weren't framed with the goal of minimizing risk for the audience.\n\nHere's the JSON array, representing the key findings:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 8,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Describes current action/effort ('working to prevent the spread').
