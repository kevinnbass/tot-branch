AND is it distinguishable from a neutral, purely information-seeking question, as detailed in the rules?\n\n**🔍 Q4 Pattern Recognition Table:**\n| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |\n|------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Loaded Questions (Worry/Fear)** | \"Should consumers worry...?\" \"Are we facing a crisis?\" \"Is it safe to...?\" | ✓ |\n| **Loaded Questions (Inaction)** | \"Are we going to stand by while this unfolds?\" \"How long can we ignore this?\" | ✓ |\n| **Neutral Information-Seeking** | \"What are the safety protocols?\" \"When will results be available?\" | → Neutral |\n\n**🔗 See also:** Q1 for intensified language that may appear in questions; Q2 for potent metaphors in questions\n\n**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Alarmist.

Cues: 'system collapsing,' 'truly feel safe anymore?' - rhetorical question implying no).\n  * **Non-Example (Neutral):** Author: \"What are the safety protocols in place?\" (Information-seeking).\n* Use of loaded rhetorical questions by the quoted source or author that are designed to evoke fear, urgency, or strong concern by implying a severe problem or a dire lack of action.\n  * Example (Author-driven): 'How many more animals have to die before we finally act decisively?' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The rhetorical question uses emotive language 'have to die' and implies criticism of inaction, framing the situation as urgent and severe.)\n  * Example (Quote-driven): 'The activist asked, \"Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?\"' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The quoted rhetorical question uses 'disaster unfolds' to frame the situation alarmingly.)\n  * **Example (Rhetorical question from author implying worry):** Author: \"With new variants emerging rapidly, should humans be worried about the next pandemic?\" → Alarmist (if the context suggests this is not a simple information request but a way to frame emerging variants as a worrisome threat).\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – Loaded Q** | \"Should consumers be worried about buying eggs?\" | **Alarmist** | Loaded rhetorical question implying worry |\n\n**Regex Pattern:** `\\b(?:should|can|could|will)\\s+\\w+\\s+(?:be\\s+)?(?:worried|concerned)\\b`\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` \nYou will answer the **same question** (Q4) for EACH segment listed below.\nRespond with **one JSON array**.

However, these restrictions [on imports] may be short-lived, as the supply chain crunch for poultry is being felt around the globe, and HPAI viruses have sporadically emerged throughout the world in the past two years.\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_41_101_chunk0)\nI think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_42_101_chunk0)\nWhat can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_43_101_chunk0)\nAs early as last year, the U.S.D.A. warned of the likelihood of an outbreak of the avian flu and emphasized a hardening of 'biosecurity' measures to protect flocks of chickens and turkeys.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_44_101_chunk0)\nBiosecurity measures include limiting access to the flocks and requiring farm workers to practice strict hygiene measures like wearing disposable boots and coveralls.\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_45_101_chunk0)\nSharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_46_101_chunk0)\nSo can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting.\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_48_101_chunk0)\nAt this point, every person producing poultry has to be considering how to improve their biosecurity.'\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_49_101_chunk0)\nIs it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys?\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_50_101_chunk0)\nInfected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 36 (ID: seg_v5_51_101_chunk0)\nThe virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\n\n### Segment 37 (ID: seg_v5_001_1010_chunk0)\nCases of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in Indiana, Virginia, and Kentucky, posing a likely threat to the United States' domestic supply of chicken and turkey this winter.\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)\n#  -----------------------------------------------------------\n✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**\n1.

  "thoughts": "**My Expert Claim-Framing Analysis: Q4 Evaluation**\n\nMy task was to act as an expert claim-framing coder, assessing each text segment for the presence of a \"Loaded Rhetorical Question for Alarm\" (Q4). This involved scrutinizing each segment for questions designed to imply alarm, instill fear/urgency, or suggest a worrisome threat, distinguishing them from neutral information-seeking questions.  I adhered to the established framework, the \"Bedrock Principle,\" \"Symmetry Rule,\" \"Context Guard,\" and the \"Mandatory Step-by-Step Decision Process.\"  The self-audit checklist remained central to my evaluation.\n\nMy analysis yielded the following results. I meticulously examined each of the 37 text segments, applying Q4 to each one. After careful consideration, I concluded that only one segment, specifically **seg_v5_9_101_chunk0**: \"Should humans be worried about being infected?\" contained a loaded rhetorical question fitting the criteria.  The use of the word \"worried\" directly indicates an attempt to raise concern and fits the definition of a loaded question.  All other segments consisted of factual statements or informational questions not designed to instill fear or urgency.  My approach was to follow the Bedrock Principle and the Symmetry Rule while applying the strict examples of the Q4 question.\n\nHere's the JSON array containing the results of my Q4 analysis:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_25_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_26_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_27_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_28_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_29_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_30_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_32_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_33_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_34_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_36_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_39_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_40_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_1_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_3_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_4_101_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_5_101_chunk0\",\n    \""
