found in a backyard flock in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_3_1006_chunk0)\nLast week, the presence of HPAI was found in a commercial turkey flock of 30,000 in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_4_1006_chunk0)\nIf the disease spreads to enough farms in a geographic region, it could impact the production of chicken, turkey and eggs, raising consumer prices and impacting exports.\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_6_1006_chunk0)\nIn 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_8_1006_chunk0)\nEgg exports dropped 13% and turkey 23%.\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_9_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA estimated the cost to the federal government was more than $1 billion $879 million to manage the crisis and about $200 million in indemnities for lost birds.\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_1_1007_chunk0)\nChickens in one barn among a flock of 240,000 birds belonging to Tyson Foods have become infected with a lethal form of bird flu, the company confirmed.\n\n### Segment 68 (ID: seg_v5_2_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery intensifies an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. that involves poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia, and follows the destruction of 29,000 turkeys in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 69 (ID: seg_v5_3_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.\n\n### Segment 70 (ID: seg_v5_5_1007_chunk0)\nA spokesperson for Tyson Foods told Newsweek one barn among a flock of 240,000 in Kentucky had chickens that tested positive for bird flu.\n\n### Segment 71 (ID: seg_v5_9_1007_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 700 cases of bird flu in humans have been recorded globally since November 2003.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_11_1007_chunk0)\nInfection usually occurs as a result of infected birds shedding avian virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces which then gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled.\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_12_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC adds that this [infection via shedding/contact] can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or even possibly dust and a person breathes it [the virus] in, or when a person touches something that has the virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_13_1007_chunk0)\nCross infection also usually occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_15_1007_chunk0)\nWhen a person is infected with avian flu the resultant illness ranges from mild to severe.\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_16_1007_chunk0)\nIn January, Newsweek reported on a rare case of avian flu crossing over to a human in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_19_1007_chunk0)\nThese infections [human infections] are concerning for non-health-related reasons, however, especially if more poultry operations in the country are found to be affected.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_20_1007_chunk0)\nAccording to the USDA, the U.S. is the world's top producer of poultry, and number two in terms of exports, following the top exporter Brazil.\n\n### Segment 79 (ID: seg_v5_11_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this month, a strain of avian flu was confirmed at a commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana.\n\n### Segment 80 (ID: seg_v5_54_101_chunk0)\nIt's [culling] arguably more humane than letting them [birds] die from the virus,' Professor Kean said.\n\n### Segment 81 (ID: seg_v5_11_1009_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 82 (ID: seg_v5_13_1009_chunk0)\nIn a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 83 (ID: seg_v5_16_1009_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 84 (ID: seg_v5_4_1008_chunk0)\nBird flu can cause high mortality rates among birds.\n\n### Segment 85 (ID: seg_v5_5_1008_chunk0)\nIn 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\n\n### Segment 86 (ID: seg_v5_6_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA said it detected the presence of the virus in an undisclosed number of birds from a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 87 (ID: seg_v5_9_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA is awaiting results of a potential second case about 124 miles northeast in Webster County, Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 88 (ID: seg_v5_10_1008_chunk0)\nMeanwhile, a backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also tested positive for the virus.\n\n### Segment 89 (ID: seg_v5_1_1009_chunk0)\nA \"highly pathogenic\" form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\n### Segment 90 (ID: seg_v5_10_1009_chunk0)\nIt [the detection in New York] came after the virus was discovered in flocks of birds in Kentucky, Virginia, and Indiana.\n\n### Segment 91 (ID: seg_v5_2_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\n\n### Segment 92 (ID: seg_v5_9_1000_chunk0)\nAuthorities believe wild birds have been spreading the virus, after dozens recently tested positive for the flu along the East Coast, Reuters reported.\n\n### Segment 93 (ID: seg_v5_21_101_chunk0)\nStill, the U.S.D.A. recommends cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 Fahrenheit to reduce the potential for food-borne illness.\n\n### Segment 94 (ID: seg_v5_24_101_chunk0)\nRecently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 95 (ID: seg_v5_25_101_chunk0)\nIf infections course through more flocks, experts said, there could be some shortages of eggs.\n\n### Segment 96 (ID: seg_v5_26_101_chunk0)\nPrices for white and dark chicken meat were also rising, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 97 (ID: seg_v5_27_101_chunk0)\nExperts also warned that turkey prices could also become more volatile.\n\n### Segment 98 (ID: seg_v5_30_101_chunk0)\nOutbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\n\n### Segment 99 (ID: seg_v5_32_101_chunk0)\nThe combined number of birds in the infected flocks -- the commercial and backyard type -- totaled more than 17 million, according to the agency.\n\n### Segment 100 (ID: seg_v5_34_101_chunk0)\nAn commercial egg production facility in Buena Vista County, Iowa, constituted the largest infected flock and was made up of more than 5.3 million chickens, the U.S.D.A. said.\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)\n#

  "thoughts": "**Summary of My Q9 Analysis**\n\nAlright, I've gone through the text segments to see which ones fit the criteria for Q9: primarily reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs and neutral adverbs, without vivid/potent verbs, risk adjectives, or explicit framing.\n\nMy thought process was to carefully read each segment and look for direct reports of prices, costs, supply/inventory changes, export data, and so on. I had to pay close attention to the verbs and adjectives used to describe these metrics, ensuring they were neutral and not sensationalized. I also had to identify any economic ranking data, such as market positions, and how they relate to the core Q9 question.\n\nHere's my final determination, rendered as a JSON array as requested:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 4,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 7,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 8,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 9,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 10,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 11,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 12,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 13,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 14,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 24,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 25,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 26,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 31,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 32,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 39,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 46,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 55,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 56,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 63,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 64,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 65,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 66,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 78,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 85,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 94,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 95,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 96,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 97,\n    \"q9_fit\": true\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThese segments report directly on economic indicators like prices, supply/demand, market trends, and costs, meeting the Q9 requirements. All others are excluded for various reasons: focusing on events, infection descriptions, or lacking direct economic metrics.\n"
