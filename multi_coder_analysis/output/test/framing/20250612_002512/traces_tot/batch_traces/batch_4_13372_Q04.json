'As part of existing avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks,' the agency [APHIS] added.\n\n### Segment 40 (ID: seg_v5_12_1000_chunk0)\nLast week, Mexico joined several other countries in banning or limiting poultry imports from Indiana following the disease outbreak.\n\n### Segment 41 (ID: seg_v5_13_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. is currently the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to Reuters.\n\n### Segment 42 (ID: seg_v5_14_1000_chunk0)\nKentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken-meat producing state and that it is working 'diligently' to prevent the disease from spreading to other poultry flocks.\n\n### Segment 43 (ID: seg_v5_15_1000_chunk0)\nThe flu outbreaks are hitting the country at a time when poultry market supplies have dropped due to the COVID-19 pandemic and labor shortages.\n\n### Segment 44 (ID: seg_v5_16_1000_chunk0)\nAccording to Reuters, data has found that frozen chicken supplies were down 14 percent from a year ago at the end of December, while turkey inventories were down 23 percent.\n\n### Segment 45 (ID: seg_v5_1_1002_chunk0)\nAccording to the agency, bird flu was found in Fauquier County, Virginia; and in Fulton County, Kentucky, on Feb. 12, in non-poultry birds and commercial broiler chickens, respectively.\n\n### Segment 46 (ID: seg_v5_2_1002_chunk0)\nOn Feb. 8, bird influenza was detected in commercial turkeys in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 47 (ID:

Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the U.S. case was identified.\n\n### Segment 56 (ID: seg_v5_14_1005_chunk0)\nMigratory wild birds often carry strains of avian influenza and they’re often low pathogenic, which means they don’t kill the birds.\n\n### Segment 57 (ID: seg_v5_17_1005_chunk0)\nU.S. surveillance efforts have identified the virus [H5N1] in wild birds in recent weeks in New Hampshire, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and South Carolina, making it [H5N1] apparent that it [H5N1] is in the environment broadly.\n\n### Segment 58 (ID: seg_v5_18_1005_chunk0)\nThe virus [H5N1] spreads easily from wild bird droppings and can be carried into commercial flocks on the feet of workers or on equipment, which is why high-level biosecurity protocol has been activated across the country in commercial operations.\n\n### Segment 59 (ID: seg_v5_19_1005_chunk0)\nThey [commercial operations]’ve enacted new safeguards to prevent deadly bird flu infections, often referred to as HPAI, and isolate them [deadly bird flu infections] when they [deadly bird flu infections] occur.\n\n### Segment 60 (ID: seg_v5_20_1005_chunk0)\n“With the increased preparatory efforts USDA and its partners have put into place since the 2015 HPAI outbreak, we are fully prepared to handle this detection,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA, which deals with outbreaks on U.S.\n\n### Segment 61 (ID: seg_v5_1_1001_chunk0)\nAvian flu has now been detected in flocks of birds in Virginia and Kentucky, just days after Indiana officials had to euthanize 29,000 turkeys due to the spread of the virus [avian flu], the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Monday.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_2_1001_chunk0)\nDozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_3_1001_chunk0)\nAvian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_4_1001_chunk0)\nBirds at a commercial turkey farm in Southern Indiana contracted the virus [avian flu] last week, forcing officials to cull 29,000 turkeys in an attempt to stop the spread.\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_5_1001_chunk0)\nA backyard flock of mixed birds in Virginia had to be culled after they [the backyard flock] tested positive for avian flu.\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_6_1001_chunk0)\nOfficials are also working to depopulate a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, that tested positive for the flu [avian flu].\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_7_1001_chunk0)\nTest results are still pending for a separate flock in Webster County.\n\n### Segment 68 (ID: seg_v5_8_1001_chunk0)\nThe culled birds will not enter the food system at a time when the agricultural industry is already being challenged by rising inflation and supply chain issues.\n\n### Segment 69 (ID: seg_v5_9_1001_chunk0)\nThe price index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs saw the largest increase among all food groups last month, rising 12.2% over January of last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n### Segment 70 (ID: seg_v5_10_1001_chunk0)\nPoultry farms in Africa, Europe, and Asia are also dealing with avian flu.\n\n### Segment 71 (ID: seg_v5_1_10_chunk0)\nMore than 35,000 chickens are to be culled at a Dutch farm after a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu was discovered there, the agriculture ministry announced Thursday.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_2_10_chunk0)\nThe outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_3_10_chunk0)\nThe government did not immediately report the exact strain of bird flu that infected chickens on the farm.\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_4_10_chunk0)\nThe agriculture ministry tightened controls Thursday around the infected farm in the village of Altforst, 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the capital, Amsterdam.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_5_10_chunk0)\nAnother 34 farms are situated within a 10-kilometer (6 mile) radius of the infected location.\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_6_10_chunk0)\nAuthorities banned the transport of any birds, eggs, manure, used straw and other animal products from the 10-kilometer ring around the infected farm.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_2_1005_chunk0)\nThe new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_3_1005_chunk0)\nThe 29,000 turkeys in the flock were killed to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 79 (ID: seg_v5_4_1005_chunk0)\nThe poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry.\n\n### Segment 80 (ID: seg_v5_5_1005_chunk0)\nEgg, turkey and chicken prices could rise and availability could drop if birds at enough farms were to be infected.\n\n### Segment 81 (ID: seg_v5_6_1005_chunk0)\n“It’s definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry,” said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association.\n\n### Segment 82 (ID: seg_v5_7_1005_chunk0)\n“I feel positive that we can tackle this situation better and I have my fingers crossed that this will be an isolated case, however, I would hope for the best and be prepared for the worst.”\n\n### Segment 83 (ID: seg_v5_8_1005_chunk0)\nHealth officials say no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S. and the disease doesn’t present an immediate public health concern.\n\n### Segment 84 (ID: seg_v5_9_1005_chunk0)\nThe 2015 outbreak led producers to kill 33 million egg-laying hens in Iowa, the nation’s leading egg producer, and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation’s leading turkey producer, with smaller outbreaks in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\n### Segment 85 (ID: seg_v5_2_1004_chunk0)\nThe United States Department of Agriculture confirmed Feb. 9 that a commercial turkey flock in Indiana was hit with avian flu, the first case in the U.S. since 2020.\n\n### Segment 86 (ID: seg_v5_3_1004_chunk0)\nThe entire flock of nearly 30,000 birds was euthanized in an effort to stop the spread.\n\n### Segment 87 (ID: seg_v5_4_1004_chunk0)\nThen on Feb. 14, the agency confirmed that a commercial flock of broiler chickens was hit with bird flu in Kentucky, and a backyard flock of mixed species fowl also tested positive in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 88 (ID: seg_v5_5_1004_chunk0)\nBoth flocks were culled.\n\n### Segment 89 (ID: seg_v5_7_1004_chunk0)\nNational Turkey Federation Vice President of Communications Beth Breeding told FOX Business that producers are focused on farm security every day and that members remain vigilant and practice all biosecurity protocols.\n\n### Segment 90 (ID: seg_v5_8_1004_chunk0)\nShe [Beth Breeding] said that for farms within a 10km control zone of confirmed bird flu cases, regular testing is taking place to monitor the health of flocks.\n\n### Segment 91 (ID: seg_v5_9_1004_chunk0)\nA spokesperson from the USDA told FOX Business that the agency recently expanded its wild bird surveillance after the first detection of HPAI in a wild bird in the U.S., and that the surveillance of wild birds ensures that both the agency and the poultry industry are able to enhance biosecurity measures and rapidly respond to reduce the risk of disease spread.\n\n### Segment 92 (ID: seg_v5_10_1004_chunk0)\nThe spokesperson said that bird owners (whether it’s commercial or backyard poultry, or pet or hobby birds), should take some simple steps to protect their birds from the virus:\n\n### Segment 93 (ID: seg_v5_12_1006_chunk0)\nThe virus is spread by migratory birds and waterfowl, usually this time of year.\n\n### Segment 94 (ID: seg_v5_13_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods is prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing,' the company said in an emailed statement.\n\n### Segment 95 (ID: seg_v5_14_1006_chunk0)\nPlans include additional restrictions on access to farms and continuing to test each flock for avian influenza before it is processed.\n\n### Segment 96 (ID: seg_v5_15_1006_chunk0)\nFarms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\n\n### Segment 97 (ID: seg_v5_16_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\n\n### Segment 98 (ID: seg_v5_21_1005_chunk0)\nFederal and state officials are working with the poultry industry and have initiated steps such as an immediate quarantine that restricts movement of poultry and equipment used to move birds in and out of specified perimeters around an infected barn usually around 6 miles initially and eradication of the virus by killing and removing birds at the infection site.\n\n### Segment 99 (ID: seg_v5_22_1005_chunk0)\nTesting occurs in the quarantine area of both wild and domestic birds.\n\n### Segment 100 (ID: seg_v5_23_1005_chunk0)\nDisinfection is done to kill the virus [H5N1] at the affected farm and testing is used to confirm it’s free of the virus [H5N1].\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT
