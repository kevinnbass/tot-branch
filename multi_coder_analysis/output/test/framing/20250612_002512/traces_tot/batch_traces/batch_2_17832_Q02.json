Context and the 'Principle of Cue Sufficiency' are key.)**\n\n**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**\n* Authorial use of vivid, active verbs or metaphors to describe the spread or impact of a threat, especially when combined with its scale or severity, thereby emphasizing its uncontrolled, rapid, or overwhelming nature. Example: Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)\n\n**Alarmist - Examples:**\n* \"The economic impact of the subject on the agricultural sector is a ticking time-bomb for food security,\" said the analyst. (Alarmist → The analyst's quote uses a potent metaphor \"ticking time-bomb,\" framing the economic impact with fear/urgency.)\n* Author: \"Political inaction is steering us towards a catastrophic crisis related to the subject.\" (Alarmist → Author's framing of political aspect through loaded language like \"catastrophic crisis,\" assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Author-driven, vivid metaphor & intensifier):**\n  * Author: \"The virus is a raging inferno, tearing through populations with terrifying speed, leaving devastation in its wake.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses vivid metaphor 'raging inferno,' 'tearing through,' 'terrifying speed,' and 'devastation in its wake.' Decisive cues: 'raging inferno,' 'terrifying speed'.\"\n* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: \"The disease ravaged poultry flocks across three states, leading to immense economic losses.\" (Alarmist → 'Ravaged' + 'across three states' + 'immense economic losses' create a strong alarmist frame).\n* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: \"Confirmed cases soared past one million, overwhelming healthcare systems.\" (Alarmist → 'Soared past one million' + 'overwhelming healthcare systems' creates a strong alarmist frame).\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – High-potency verb** | \"An outbreak ravaged farms across three states.\" | **Alarmist** | \"ravaged\" (vivid, destructive verb) |\n| **Alarmist – Superlative-negative-noun** | \"The H5N1 wave is now considered the most expensive animal-health disaster in U.S. history.\" | **Alarmist** | \"most expensive...disaster\" (superlative + negative noun) |\n| **Alarmist – Critical alert phrase** | \"State authorities remain on high alert for new cases.\" | **Alarmist** | \"on high alert\" (critical alert phrase) |\n\n**Boundary guard:** If the verb is \"hit / hitting / swept / surged\" but the segment gives no numbers, adjectives or metaphors that convey magnitude, treat it as Neutral.

by USDA.\n\n### Segment 2 (ID: seg_v5_16_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\n\n### Segment 3 (ID: seg_v5_21_1005_chunk0)\nFederal and state officials are working with the poultry industry and have initiated steps such as an immediate quarantine that restricts movement of poultry and equipment used to move birds in and out of specified perimeters around an infected barn usually around 6 miles initially and eradication of the virus by killing and removing birds at the infection site.\n\n### Segment 4 (ID: seg_v5_22_1005_chunk0)\nTesting occurs in the quarantine area of both wild and domestic birds.\n\n### Segment 5 (ID: seg_v5_23_1005_chunk0)\nDisinfection is done to kill the virus [H5N1] at the affected farm and testing is used to confirm it’s free of the virus [H5N1].\n\n### Segment 6 (ID: seg_v5_24_1005_chunk0)\nProducers who want to ensure eligibility for government indemnity payments in case of disaster must have a biosecurity protocol on hand that is updated regularly.\n\n### Segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_25_1005_chunk0)\nTo help with that [ensuring eligibility for government indemnity payments/having a biosecurity protocol], the USDA has developed a 14-point biosecurity plan for producers, which is audited yearly and reviewed every two years by state agriculture agencies, Sato said.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_26_1005_chunk0)\nIn Iowa, a state with 49 million chickens, egg farmers are working with state and federal authorities to keep the disease out of their flocks, said Kevin Stiles, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association and the Iowa Egg Council.\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_27_1005_chunk0)\n“IPA is maintaining open communications specifically related to biosecurity best practices and is offering surveillance testing.\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_28_1005_chunk0)\nWe [IPA] are confident in our producers preparedness and ability to manage their flocks,” he [Kevin Stiles] said.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_21_1007_chunk0)\nThe U.S. was forecast to export 3.4 million tons of chicken meat in 2022, of total global export of 13.4 million tons.\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_22_1007_chunk0)\nThe growth in U.S. chicken meat export is partially due to the downturn in exports of chicken meat from the European Union which was caused by avian flu.\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_23_1007_chunk0)\nThe USDA says as part of avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working together to provide additional surveillance and testing in regions surrounding where the affected flocks are located.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_24_1007_chunk0)\nThey [federal and state partners] add that anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyards up to the large commercial producers should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID: seg_v5_25_1007_chunk0)\nThe Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS) is offering a biosecurity tool kit for poultry producers and a list of cases can be found on its website.\n\n### Segment 16 (ID: seg_v5_26_1007_chunk0)\nThe site currently lists three cases in commercial birds during the current outbreak.\n\n### Segment 17 (ID: seg_v5_27_1007_chunk0)\nThis [list of cases] includes commercial turkeys, a mixed-species backyard flock in Fauquier County, Virginia, and the broiler chicken flock in Fulton County, Kentucky, belonging to Tyson foods.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_28_1007_chunk0)\nThis article and its headline were updated to clarify a barn of chickens among a flock of 240,000 birds was infected with bird flu.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_1_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_2_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA also said HPAI was found in a backyard flock in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_3_1006_chunk0)\nLast week, the presence of HPAI was found in a commercial turkey flock of 30,000 in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_4_1006_chunk0)\nIf the disease spreads to enough farms in a geographic region, it could impact the production of chicken, turkey and eggs, raising consumer prices and impacting exports.\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_5_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods said it does not expect the case in Kentucky to impact its overall production.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_6_1006_chunk0)\nIn 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_7_1006_chunk0)\nThough broiler chickens weren't heavily infected, exports dropped by $1.1 billion, or 26%.\n\n### Segment 26 (ID: seg_v5_8_1006_chunk0)\nEgg exports dropped 13% and turkey 23%.\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_9_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA estimated the cost to the federal government was more than $1 billion $879 million to manage the crisis and about $200 million in indemnities for lost birds.\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_10_1006_chunk0)\nThe USDA says avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and that no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_1_1007_chunk0)\nChickens in one barn among a flock of 240,000 birds belonging to Tyson Foods have become infected with a lethal form of bird flu, the company confirmed.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_2_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery intensifies an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. that involves poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia, and follows the destruction of 29,000 turkeys in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_3_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_4_1007_chunk0)\nThe governmental department added that avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern as a human case of these avian flu viruses has yet to be detected in the U.S.\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_5_1007_chunk0)\nA spokesperson for Tyson Foods told Newsweek one barn among a flock of 240,000 in Kentucky had chickens that tested positive for bird flu.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_6_1007_chunk0)\nTyson Foods said in a statement to Newsweek: 'We are actively working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.'\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_7_1007_chunk0)\nAlthough the origin of the infection is not known, avian influenza has been found in migratory wild birds, which play a significant role in spreading the disease.'\n\n### Segment 36 (ID: seg_v5_8_1007_chunk0)\nWe are 'prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing,' it [Tyson Foods] added, including 'heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, placing additional restrictions on outside visitors, and continuing our practice of testing all flocks for avian influenza before birds leave the farms.'\n\n### Segment 37 (ID: seg_v5_9_1007_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 700 cases of bird flu in humans have been recorded globally since November 2003.\n\n### Segment 38 (ID: seg_v5_10_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC says that though bird flu can cross species and infect humans, this cross-transmission [bird flu crossing species and infecting humans] is rare.\n\n### Segment 39 (ID: seg_v5_11_1007_chunk0)\nInfection usually occurs as a result of infected birds shedding avian virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces which then gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled.\n\n### Segment 40 (ID: seg_v5_12_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC adds that this [infection via shedding/contact] can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or even possibly dust and a person breathes it [the virus] in, or when a person touches something that has the virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.\n\n### Segment 41 (ID: seg_v5_13_1007_chunk0)\nCross infection also usually occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses.\n\n### Segment 42 (ID: seg_v5_14_1007_chunk0)\nBut, the CDC reports some infections have been identified where direct contact was not known to have occurred.\n\n### Segment 43 (ID: seg_v5_15_1007_chunk0)\nWhen a person is infected with avian flu the resultant illness ranges from mild to severe.\n\n### Segment 44 (ID: seg_v5_16_1007_chunk0)\nIn January, Newsweek reported on a rare case of avian flu crossing over to a human in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Segment 45

  "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis Summary**\n\nOkay, I've just run through all 100 text segments, applying the Q2 filter. My expert judgment, based on my understanding of framing theory and the specific criteria, is that the following segments trigger the \"Alarmist\" frame:\n\n*   **Segment 50 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_12\\_1008\\_chunk0):** Answer: yes. Rationale: Quote the cue \"ON HIGH ALERT\".\n*   **Segment 68 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_3\\_1008\\_chunk0):** Answer: yes. Rationale: Quote the cue \"reigniting fears\".\n\nThe remaining 98 segments are categorized as \"no,\" as they don't contain high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative noun combinations, or the specific \"on high alert\" phrase with a nearby threat keyword, or phrases that are intentionally framing the situation alarmingly (like in Segment 68). I've followed all the necessary guards (Context, Technical-term, and Precedence Ladder) and have adhered to the Bedrock Principle and Symmetry Rule throughout my analysis. My 6-point self-audit checklist confirms I've systematically applied each element of the Q2 rule with due diligence.\n"
