the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_2_100_chunk0)\nSince the outbreak began a month ago, millions of fowl have been killed, many of them in Iowa, which is the nation’s leading egg producer.\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_3_100_chunk0)\nThe latest cases were at a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County.\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_002_1003_chunk0)\nInfections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_003_1003_chunk0)\nLast week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_004_1003_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials said.\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_009_1003_chunk0)\nMickelson added that Tyson Foods' chicken products are safe to eat.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_12_1000_chunk0)\nLast week, Mexico joined several other countries in banning or limiting poultry imports from Indiana following the disease outbreak.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID:

Reuters.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_8_1002_chunk0)\nTyson Foods Inc. confirmed that a flock of about 240,000 chickens tested positive.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_12_1005_chunk0)\nThe strain now circulating is H5N1 and is related to the 2015 virus.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_13_1005_chunk0)\nIt [H5N1] has been circulating for months in Europe and Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the U.S. case was identified.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_1_1001_chunk0)\nAvian flu has now been detected in flocks of birds in Virginia and Kentucky, just days after Indiana officials had to euthanize 29,000 turkeys due to the spread of the virus [avian flu], the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Monday.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_2_1001_chunk0)\nDozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\n\n### Segment 23 (ID:

spread.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_5_1001_chunk0)\nA backyard flock of mixed birds in Virginia had to be culled after they [the backyard flock] tested positive for avian flu.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_10_1001_chunk0)\nPoultry farms in Africa, Europe, and Asia are also dealing with avian flu.\n\n### Segment 26 (ID: seg_v5_2_10_chunk0)\nThe outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_3_10_chunk0)\nThe government did not immediately report the exact strain of bird flu that infected chickens on the farm.\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_5_10_chunk0)\nAnother 34 farms are situated within a 10-kilometer (6 mile) radius of the infected location.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_2_1005_chunk0)\nThe new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_3_1005_chunk0)\nThe 29,000 turkeys in the flock were killed to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_6_1005_chunk0)\n“It’s definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry,” said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_9_1005_chunk0)\nThe 2015 outbreak led producers to kill 33 million egg-laying hens in Iowa, the nation’s leading egg producer, and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation’s leading turkey producer, with smaller outbreaks in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_2_1004_chunk0)\nThe United States Department of Agriculture confirmed Feb. 9 that a commercial turkey flock in Indiana was hit with avian flu, the first case in the U.S. since 2020.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_3_1004_chunk0)\nThe entire flock of nearly 30,000 birds was euthanized in an effort to stop the spread.\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_4_1004_chunk0)\nThen on Feb. 14, the agency confirmed that a commercial flock of broiler chickens was hit with bird flu in Kentucky, and a backyard flock of mixed species fowl also tested positive in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 36 (ID: seg_v5_5_1004_chunk0)\nBoth flocks were culled.\n\n### Segment 37 (ID: seg_v5_12_1006_chunk0)\nThe virus is spread by migratory birds and waterfowl, usually this time of year.\n\n### Segment 38 (ID: seg_v5_16_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\n\n### Segment 39 (ID: seg_v5_26_1007_chunk0)\nThe site currently lists three cases in commercial birds during the current outbreak.\n\n### Segment 40 (ID: seg_v5_27_1007_chunk0)\nThis [list of cases] includes commercial turkeys, a mixed-species backyard flock in Fauquier County, Virginia, and the broiler chicken flock in Fulton County, Kentucky, belonging to Tyson foods.\n\n### Segment 41 (ID: seg_v5_28_1007_chunk0)\nThis article and its headline were updated to clarify a barn of chickens among a flock of 240,000 birds was infected with bird flu.\n\n### Segment 42 (ID: seg_v5_1_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 43 (ID: seg_v5_2_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA also said HPAI was found in a backyard flock in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 44 (ID: seg_v5_3_1006_chunk0)\nLast week, the presence of HPAI was found in a commercial turkey flock of 30,000 in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 45 (ID: seg_v5_1_1007_chunk0)\nChickens in one barn among a flock of 240,000 birds belonging to Tyson Foods have become infected with a lethal form of bird flu, the company confirmed.\n\n### Segment 46 (ID: seg_v5_2_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery intensifies an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. that involves poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia, and follows the destruction of 29,000 turkeys in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 47 (ID: seg_v5_3_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.\n\n### Segment 48 (ID: seg_v5_5_1007_chunk0)\nA spokesperson for Tyson Foods told Newsweek one barn among a flock of 240,000 in Kentucky had chickens that tested positive for bird flu.\n\n### Segment 49 (ID: seg_v5_9_1007_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 700 cases of bird flu in humans have been recorded globally since November 2003.\n\n### Segment 50 (ID: seg_v5_11_1007_chunk0)\nInfection usually occurs as a result of infected birds shedding avian virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces which then gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled.\n\n### Segment 51 (ID: seg_v5_12_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC adds that this [infection via shedding/contact] can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or even possibly dust and a person breathes it [the virus] in, or when a person touches something that has the virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.\n\n### Segment 52 (ID: seg_v5_13_1007_chunk0)\nCross infection also usually occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses.\n\n### Segment 53 (ID: seg_v5_15_1007_chunk0)\nWhen a person is infected with avian flu the resultant illness ranges from mild to severe.\n\n### Segment 54 (ID: seg_v5_16_1007_chunk0)\nIn January, Newsweek reported on a rare case of avian flu crossing over to a human in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Segment 55 (ID: seg_v5_19_1007_chunk0)\nThese infections [human infections] are concerning for non-health-related reasons, however, especially if more poultry operations in the country are found to be affected.\n\n### Segment 56 (ID: seg_v5_11_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this month, a strain of avian flu was confirmed at a commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana.\n\n### Segment 57 (ID: seg_v5_54_101_chunk0)\nIt's [culling] arguably more humane than letting them [birds] die from the virus,' Professor Kean said.\n\n### Segment 58 (ID: seg_v5_11_1009_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 59 (ID: seg_v5_13_1009_chunk0)\nIn a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 60 (ID: seg_v5_16_1009_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 61 (ID: seg_v5_4_1008_chunk0)\nBird flu can cause high mortality rates among birds.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_6_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA said it detected the presence of the virus in an undisclosed number of birds from a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_9_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA is awaiting results of a potential second case about 124 miles northeast in Webster County, Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_10_1008_chunk0)\nMeanwhile, a backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also tested positive for the virus.\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_1_1009_chunk0)\nA \"highly pathogenic\" form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_10_1009_chunk0)\nIt [the detection in New York] came after the virus was discovered in flocks of birds in Kentucky, Virginia, and Indiana.\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_2_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\n\n### Segment 68 (ID: seg_v5_9_1000_chunk0)\nAuthorities believe wild birds have been spreading the virus, after dozens recently tested positive for the flu along the East Coast, Reuters reported.\n\n### Segment 69 (ID: seg_v5_21_101_chunk0)\nStill, the U.S.D.A. recommends cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 Fahrenheit to reduce the potential for food-borne illness.\n\n### Segment 70 (ID: seg_v5_30_101_chunk0)\nOutbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\n\n### Segment 71 (ID: seg_v5_32_101_chunk0)\nThe combined number of birds in the infected flocks -- the commercial and backyard type -- totaled more than 17 million, according to the agency.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_34_101_chunk0)\nAn commercial egg production facility in Buena Vista County, Iowa, constituted the largest infected flock and was made up of more than 5.3 million chickens, the U.S.D.A. said.\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_36_101_chunk0)\nA commercial poultry flock in New Castle County, Del., was the third-largest infected flock, with more than 1.1 million chickens.\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_39_101_chunk0)\nNearly 50 million birds died, either from the virus or from having to be culled, a majority of them in Iowa or Minnesota.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_40_101_chunk0)\nThe footprint of the current outbreak, extending from the Midwest and Plains to northern New England, has raised concerns.\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_3_101_chunk0)\nIowa has been particularly hard hit, with disasters being declared in some counties and the state canceling live bird exhibits in an order that may affect its famed state fair.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_4_101_chunk0)\nBetter known as the bird flu, avian influenza is a highly contagious and deadly virus that can prey on chickens, turkeys and wild birds, including ducks and geese.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_5_101_chunk0)\nIt [Avian influenza] spreads via nasal secretions, saliva and fecal droppings, which experts say makes it [spread] difficult to contain.\n\n### Segment 79 (ID: seg_v5_6_101_chunk0)\nSymptoms of the virus include a sudden increase in the mortality of a flock, a drop in egg production and diminished consumption of feed and water.\n\n### Segment 80 (ID: seg_v5_7_101_chunk0)\nThe virus, Eurasian H5N1, is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry.\n\n### Segment 81 (ID: seg_v5_014_1010_chunk0)\nHowever, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\n\n### Segment 82 (ID: seg_v5_015_1010_chunk0)\nNonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak [of H5N1].\n\n### Segment 83 (ID: seg_v5_41_101_chunk0)\nI think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n### Segment 84 (ID: seg_v5_42_101_chunk0)\nWhat can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\n\n### Segment 85 (ID: seg_v5_45_101_chunk0)\nSharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus.\n\n### Segment 86 (ID: seg_v5_46_101_chunk0)\nSo can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting.\n\n### Segment 87 (ID: seg_v5_49_101_chunk0)\nIs it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys?\n\n### Segment 88 (ID: seg_v5_50_101_chunk0)\nInfected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 89 (ID: seg_v5_001_1010_chunk0)\nCases of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in Indiana, Virginia, and Kentucky, posing a likely threat to the United States' domestic supply of chicken and turkey this winter.\n\n\n#

  "thoughts": "**Summary of Q10 Evaluation**\n\nMy task was to apply Q10 to a list of text segments, which meant identifying those that speculate about future relief or improvement *without* an explicit calming cue about the *current* situation. In other words, I was looking for text that suggests things will get better down the line (e.g., recovery, normalization) without also providing an immediate, reassuring perspective on the present.\n\nI meticulously reviewed each segment, looking for phrases like \"may be short-lived,\" \"could ease soon,\" \"might improve,\" or \"expect recovery.\" I also made sure to consider the context to avoid misinterpreting speculation. For example, if a segment mentioned potential improvement *but* also reassured about the current situation, it would not fit Q10.\n\nAfter a thorough analysis of all 89 segments, my conclusion was consistent: none of them met the criteria for Q10.  Every segment either described past or current events, reported facts, or presented scenarios that were not explicitly future-focused on relief. Some speculated on future *negative* outcomes (e.g., potential burden on consumers), which wouldn't qualify. Others provided calming cues, which would likely have been categorized under Q5 (Reassuring). Therefore, the answer for all segments is \"no\".\n"
