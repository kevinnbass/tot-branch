(Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: \"The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%.\" (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).\n* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: \"Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds.\" (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').\n\n**Key Principle:** \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" \"plummeted\" can be potent verbs on their own (see Q2) if used dramatically. This rule specifically addresses their use when their alarmist nature is confirmed by accompanying details of scale/impact.\n\n**Boundary Requirements (clarified):**\n1. Verb **must appear in the approved list / regex**.  \n2. Must denote realised impact (not a plan or hypothetical).  \n3. Plain outcome verbs (*killed, died, affected, reported*) are excluded—Neutral unless other cues fire.\n\n**Examples of Scale/Impact Indicators:**\n- Numerical quantities: \"millions,\" \"thousands,\" \"50%,\" \"record numbers\"\n- Comparative terms: \"largest,\" \"highest,\" \"most severe,\" \"unprecedented\"\n- Impact descriptors: \"overwhelming,\" \"devastating losses,\" \"widespread damage\"\n\n> **New aspect guard.** The moderate-verb must denote **realised impact** – NOT merely an intention or hypothetical.  \n\n**Regex Pattern (tightened – comment shows exclusion):**\n```regex\n\\b(hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|\n     # ONLY active, realised culling counts\n     (?:were|was)\\s+culled|hitting)\\b\n(?=[^.]{0,12}\\b(?:\\d|million|millions|thousand|thousands|record|largest|unprecedented|severe|significant|overwhelming|devastating)\\b)\n```\n# Passive/future forms (\"to be culled\", \"had to be culled\", \"planning to cull\")\n# fall through to Q8 (capability) or Q10 (speculative relief).\n\n**Clarification (v 2.16.2)** — Containment actions  \n\"Birds were *euthanized/depopulated* to prevent spread\" is **Neutral** unless paired with an explicit large-scale impact (e.g., \"euthanized ***millions*** of birds across 10 states\").\n\nIf the parser lemmatises verbs, **keep only the past-tense form** `culled`; exclude the lemma \"cull\" and its gerund unless explicitly preceded by a past-tense auxiliary (\"were/was culling\") that confirms an event already occurred.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` \nYou will answer the **same question** (Q3) for EACH segment listed below.\nRespond with **one JSON array**.

However, these restrictions [on imports] may be short-lived, as the supply chain crunch for poultry is being felt around the globe, and HPAI viruses have sporadically emerged throughout the world in the past two years.\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_41_101_chunk0)\nI think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_42_101_chunk0)\nWhat can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_43_101_chunk0)\nAs early as last year, the U.S.D.A. warned of the likelihood of an outbreak of the avian flu and emphasized a hardening of 'biosecurity' measures to protect flocks of chickens and turkeys.\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_44_101_chunk0)\nBiosecurity measures include limiting access to the flocks and requiring farm workers to practice strict hygiene measures like wearing disposable boots and coveralls.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_45_101_chunk0)\nSharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus.\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_46_101_chunk0)\nSo can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_48_101_chunk0)\nAt this point, every person producing poultry has to be considering how to improve their biosecurity.'\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_49_101_chunk0)\nIs it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys?\n\n### Segment 36 (ID: seg_v5_50_101_chunk0)\nInfected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 37 (ID: seg_v5_51_101_chunk0)\nThe virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\n\n### Segment 38 (ID: seg_v5_001_1010_chunk0)\nCases of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in Indiana, Virginia, and Kentucky, posing a likely threat to the United States' domestic supply of chicken and turkey this winter.\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)\n#  -----------------------------------------------------------\n✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**\n1.

  "thoughts": "**Applying Decision Tree Q3 to Text Segments**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I've been tasked with going through a list of text segments and applying Q3 of the decision tree.  Specifically, I'm looking for \"moderate verbs\" paired with \"significant scale or impact\" information.  Remember, the key here is *realized* impact, not plans or hypotheticals. I'm focusing on those moderate verbs: `hit`, `swept`, `surged`, etc., and matching them with indicators like `\\d`, `million`, `record`, etc. I'm excluding plain outcome verbs and passive/future forms.\n\nI methodically went through each segment, carefully checking for that specific combination. I ruled out segments if they didn't have the right verb, the right scale, or if the verb was in the wrong tense/form. I also used the examples provided as a guide, especially when things were a little grey, like the segment concerning \"hard hit\" in Iowa.  I noted that example lacked explicit scale and impact, even though \"hard hit\" is in the moderate verb list. I kept referencing the regex to ensure my assessments aligned with the established rules. \n\nAfter careful consideration of each segment and the application of the defined rules, I've concluded that only *one* segment meets the criteria for Q3.  The segment that triggered the alarm is:\n\n\"From Wyoming to Maine, an outbreak of the highly contagious bird flu has *swept across* farms and backyard flocks in the United States this year, *prompting millions* of chickens and turkeys to be culled.\"\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   \"swept across\" is a past tense moderate verb.\n*   \"prompting\" is a gerund/present participle and, according to the provided example, functions similarly as an indicator of real impact.\n*   \"millions\" is a clear scale indicator.\n*   The regex confirms this pattern as Alarmist.\n\nBased on this analysis, the resulting output will be:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 14,\n    \"alarmist\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 1,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 2,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 3,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 4,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 5,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 6,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 7,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 8,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 9,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 10,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 11,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 12,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 13,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 15,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 16,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 17,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 18,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 19,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 20,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 21,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 22,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 23,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 24,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_number\": 25,\n    \"alarmist\": false\n  "
