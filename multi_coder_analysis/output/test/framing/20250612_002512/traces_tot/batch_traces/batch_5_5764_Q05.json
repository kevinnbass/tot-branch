No → Proceed to Q6.\n\n**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**\n\n**⏩ 60-Second Cue Cheat-Sheet:**\n| If you see… | Frame | Quick test |\n|-------------|-------|------------|\n| **Explicit calming cue** (\"no cause for alarm\", \"public can rest easy\") | Reassuring | Direct statement of *current* safety |\n| **Calming idiom: fully/well prepared to handle** | Reassuring | Speaker-guarded (official/author) |\n\n**Definition: Reassuring** (Key Elements)\nStatement, either through a directly quoted source or the author's own presentation, demonstrably employs explicit language, tone, or rhetorical devices specifically chosen by the author or quoted source to actively calm audience concerns, minimize perceived current risk, emphasize safety/control, or highlight positive aspects in a way designed to reduce worry regarding the subject or its impacts. The intent to reassure must be evident in the presentation, not inferred from the facts being merely positive.\n\n**Key Differentiators from Neutral (updated):**\n* Neutral reports positive facts; Reassuring adds explicit calming / optimistic amplification **or an intensified *low-risk* judgement about *current human safety*.**\n* Neutral uses standard descriptive terms for positive outcomes; Reassuring frames them with active confidence or relief.\n* Neutral may state a low risk; **Reassuring explicitly highlights the *very/exceptionally low* risk level to calm the audience.**\n* Neutral reports solutions/capabilities; Reassuring links them **directly to present safety for the public/consumers** *or* comes from a recognised public authority.\n\n**Inclusion Criteria (Reassuring):**\n* A directly quoted source **or the author** uses explicit calming language **or** an *intensified low-risk evaluation* (\"risk is **very low** for humans\") that clearly signals current safety/minimised danger.\n* Statements that not only report positive facts but also explicitly frame these facts as reasons for reduced concern or increased confidence about safety or control.\n  * **Example:** \"Vaccination rates have thankfully reached 80% in the target population, a wonderfully high figure that provides excellent protection and means the community is now much safer.\" (Reassuring. Cues: 'thankfully,' 'wonderfully high,' 'excellent protection,' 'much safer').\n* Direct assurances of safety, control, or manageability from the author or a quoted source.\n  * **Example:** \"Quote: 'We have stockpiled 30 million doses of the antiviral, which is excellent news and means our citizens are very well protected against any immediate threat from this virus.'\" (Reassuring. Cues: 'excellent news,' 'very well protected').\n**Preparedness cues fire only when BOTH conditions hold (strict guard):**\n1. *Speaker is a government or public‑health authority* **AND**  \n2. *Capability phrase links explicitly to present public/consumer safety* (≤ 40 chars span) (\"…so the public can rest easy\", \"…meaning consumers are protected\").  \nSuperlative boasts alone (\"strongest surveillance program\") are Neutral.  \nCorporate self-statements lacking a safety link stay Neutral (Rule C).  \n  * **Example (Neutral):** \"Tyson Foods is prepared for situations like this and has robust plans in place.\"\n\n**Minimal Pair Examples for Reassuring vs. Neutral:**\n* **Neutral:** \"The latest tests on the water supply showed no contaminants.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Reports absence of negative. No explicit reassuring language from the author/source about broader safety.\"\n* **Reassuring:** \"Officials confirmed the latest tests on the water supply showed no contaminants, declaring, 'This is excellent news, and residents can be fully confident in the safety of their drinking water.'\"\n  * Reasoning: \"The official's quote explicitly frames the negative test as 'excellent news' and a reason for 'full confidence' and 'safety.' Decisive cues: 'excellent news,' 'fully confident in the safety'.\"\n\n**⚠️ Important Exclusion (v2.16.1):**\n* **Neutral (NOT Reassuring):** \"The cases do not present an immediate public-health concern, the agency said.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"This is a bare negation statement without additional calming amplification.

However, these restrictions [on imports] may be short-lived, as the supply chain crunch for poultry is being felt around the globe, and HPAI viruses have sporadically emerged throughout the world in the past two years.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_41_101_chunk0)\nI think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n### Segment 26 (ID: seg_v5_42_101_chunk0)\nWhat can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_43_101_chunk0)\nAs early as last year, the U.S.D.A. warned of the likelihood of an outbreak of the avian flu and emphasized a hardening of 'biosecurity' measures to protect flocks of chickens and turkeys.\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_44_101_chunk0)\nBiosecurity measures include limiting access to the flocks and requiring farm workers to practice strict hygiene measures like wearing disposable boots and coveralls.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_45_101_chunk0)\nSharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_46_101_chunk0)\nSo can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting.\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_48_101_chunk0)\nAt this point, every person producing poultry has to be considering how to improve their biosecurity.'\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_49_101_chunk0)\nIs it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys?\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_50_101_chunk0)\nInfected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_51_101_chunk0)\nThe virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_001_1010_chunk0)\nCases of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in Indiana, Virginia, and Kentucky, posing a likely threat to the United States' domestic supply of chicken and turkey this winter.\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)\n#  -----------------------------------------------------------\n✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**\n1.

  "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segments for Calming Cues**\n\nAlright, I've been tasked with applying the Q5 criteria to this list of text segments. My job is to identify if each segment contains explicit calming cues that directly communicate safety, control, or significantly minimized present risk, keeping in mind the source (in this case, primarily official bodies or subject matter experts).\n\nHere's my thought process: I went through each segment meticulously. I was looking for specific patterns from the Q5 table and regex that indicate safety, but also considered the speaker.\n\n*   **Segments 1-18 & 21-35:** Initially, I ran through all the segments, and I found a lot of factual reporting – things like price increases, descriptions of processes, reporting of outbreaks, and descriptions of symptoms. However, none of these contained explicit calming cues. Segment 21 was a bare negative statement (no infections detected). Since the Q5 criteria are very specific, these didn't meet the requirements either.\n*   **Segment 19:** In this segment, Ron Kean from the University of Wisconsin at Madison says, \"The risk to humans is very low.\" Since he is an expert, this fits the pattern for a low-risk statement with a specific intensifier (\"very\") and thus counts as a calming cue.\n*   **Segment 20:** This segment contains two important cues: \"Fortunately for consumers,\" which is a positive amplification, and \"no evidence that the virus can spread to humans through the consumption of infected poultry,\" which is a direct safety assurance about consumption. Both qualify as Q5 cues.\n\nTherefore, after a thorough analysis, I've identified two segments containing explicit calming cues.\n"
