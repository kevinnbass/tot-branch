related to biosecurity best practices and is offering surveillance testing.\n\n### Segment 2 (ID: seg_v5_21_1007_chunk0)\nThe U.S. was forecast to export 3.4 million tons of chicken meat in 2022, of total global export of 13.4 million tons.\n\n### Segment 3 (ID: seg_v5_22_1007_chunk0)\nThe growth in U.S. chicken meat export is partially due to the downturn in exports of chicken meat from the European Union which was caused by avian flu.\n\n### Segment 4 (ID: seg_v5_23_1007_chunk0)\nThe USDA says as part of avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working together to provide additional surveillance and testing in regions surrounding where the affected flocks are located.\n\n### Segment 5 (ID: seg_v5_24_1007_chunk0)\nThey [federal and state partners] add that anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyards up to the large commercial producers should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds.\n\n### Segment 6 (ID: seg_v5_25_1007_chunk0)\nThe Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS) is offering a biosecurity tool kit for poultry producers and a list of cases can be found on its website.\n\n### Segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_26_1007_chunk0)\nThe site currently lists three cases in commercial birds during the current outbreak.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_27_1007_chunk0)\nThis [list of cases] includes commercial turkeys, a mixed-species backyard flock in Fauquier County, Virginia, and the broiler chicken flock in Fulton County, Kentucky, belonging to Tyson foods.\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_28_1007_chunk0)\nThis article and its headline were updated to clarify a barn of chickens among a flock of 240,000 birds was infected with bird flu.\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_1_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_2_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA also said HPAI was found in a backyard flock in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_3_1006_chunk0)\nLast week, the presence of HPAI was found in a commercial turkey flock of 30,000 in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_4_1006_chunk0)\nIf the disease spreads to enough farms in a geographic region, it could impact the production of chicken, turkey and eggs, raising consumer prices and impacting exports.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_5_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods said it does not expect the case in Kentucky to impact its overall production.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID: seg_v5_6_1006_chunk0)\nIn 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\n\n### Segment 16 (ID: seg_v5_7_1006_chunk0)\nThough broiler chickens weren't heavily infected, exports dropped by $1.1 billion, or 26%.\n\n### Segment 17 (ID: seg_v5_8_1006_chunk0)\nEgg exports dropped 13% and turkey 23%.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_9_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA estimated the cost to the federal government was more than $1 billion $879 million to manage the crisis and about $200 million in indemnities for lost birds.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_10_1006_chunk0)\nThe USDA says avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and that no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_1_1007_chunk0)\nChickens in one barn among a flock of 240,000 birds belonging to Tyson Foods have become infected with a lethal form of bird flu, the company confirmed.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_2_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery intensifies an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. that involves poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia, and follows the destruction of 29,000 turkeys in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_3_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_4_1007_chunk0)\nThe governmental department added that avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern as a human case of these avian flu viruses has yet to be detected in the U.S.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_5_1007_chunk0)\nA spokesperson for Tyson Foods told Newsweek one barn among a flock of 240,000 in Kentucky had chickens that tested positive for bird flu.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_6_1007_chunk0)\nTyson Foods said in a statement to Newsweek: 'We are actively working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.'\n\n### Segment 26 (ID: seg_v5_7_1007_chunk0)\nAlthough the origin of the infection is not known, avian influenza has been found in migratory wild birds, which play a significant role in spreading the disease.'\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_8_1007_chunk0)\nWe are 'prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing,' it [Tyson Foods] added, including 'heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, placing additional restrictions on outside visitors, and continuing our practice of testing all flocks for avian influenza before birds leave the farms.'\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_9_1007_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 700 cases of bird flu in humans have been recorded globally since November 2003.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_10_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC says that though bird flu can cross species and infect humans, this cross-transmission [bird flu crossing species and infecting humans] is rare.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_11_1007_chunk0)\nInfection usually occurs as a result of infected birds shedding avian virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces which then gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled.\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_12_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC adds that this [infection via shedding/contact] can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or even possibly dust and a person breathes it [the virus] in, or when a person touches something that has the virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_13_1007_chunk0)\nCross infection also usually occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses.\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_14_1007_chunk0)\nBut, the CDC reports some infections have been identified where direct contact was not known to have occurred.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_15_1007_chunk0)\nWhen a person is infected with avian flu the resultant illness ranges from mild to severe.\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_16_1007_chunk0)\nIn January, Newsweek reported on a rare case of avian flu crossing over to a human in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Segment 36 (ID: seg_v5_17_1007_chunk0)\nThe U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said at the time that the person in question, who lived in southwest England, had been in close contact with infected birds and there was no evidence of onward transmission.\n\n### Segment 37 (ID: seg_v5_18_1007_chunk0)\nIn addition to avoiding unprotected close contact with birds, the USDA advises that to further offset the risk of cross-transmission of avian flu to humans, poultry and eggs should be cooked to an internal of 165F to kill bacteria and viruses.\n\n### Segment 38 (ID: seg_v5_19_1007_chunk0)\nThese infections [human infections] are concerning for non-health-related reasons, however, especially if more poultry operations in the country are found to be affected.\n\n### Segment 39 (ID: seg_v5_20_1007_chunk0)\nAccording to the USDA, the U.S. is the world's top producer of poultry, and number two in terms of exports, following the top exporter Brazil.\n\n### Segment 40 (ID: seg_v5_11_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this month, a strain of avian flu was confirmed at a commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana.\n\n### Segment 41 (ID: seg_v5_13_1008_chunk0)\nThe agency [USDA] said the \"birds from the flocks will not enter the food system.\"\n\n### Segment 42 (ID: seg_v5_14_1008_chunk0)\nThese avian influenza detections [of avian influenza] do not \"present an immediate public health concern,\" the USDA added, citing data from U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n### Segment 43 (ID: seg_v5_15_1008_chunk0)\nThe agency [USDA] is also reminding consumers that properly prepared and cooked poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees kills bacteria and viruses.\n\n### Segment 44 (ID: seg_v5_16_1008_chunk0)\nTyson said its chicken products remain safe for consumers, and it is working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 45 (ID: seg_v5_17_1008_chunk0)\nTo mitigate the spread [of the virus], Tyson is \"heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region and placing additional restrictions on outside visitors and continuing our practice of testing all flocks for avian influenza before birds leave the farms.\"\n\n### Segment 46 (ID: seg_v5_18_1008_chunk0)\nThe company [Tyson] said the incident within one of its farms is not expected to impact production levels.\n\n### Segment 47 (ID: seg_v5_52_101_chunk0)\nMethods include spraying chickens and turkeys with a foam that causes asphyxiation.\n\n### Segment 48 (ID: seg_v5_53_101_chunk0)\nIn other cases, carbon dioxide is used to kill the birds, whose carcasses are often composted or placed in a landfill.\n\n### Segment 49 (ID: seg_v5_54_101_chunk0)\nIt's [culling] arguably more humane than letting them [birds] die from the virus,' Professor Kean said.\n\n### Segment 50 (ID: seg_v5_55_101_chunk0)\nAvian influenza was discovered at Cold Spring Egg Farm in Palmyra, Wis., forcing the commercial egg producer to destroy nearly three million chickens in March.\n\n### Segment 51 (ID: seg_v5_11_1009_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 52 (ID: seg_v5_13_1009_chunk0)\nIn a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 53 (ID: seg_v5_14_1009_chunk0)\nHuman infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they're considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\n\n### Segment 54 (ID: seg_v5_15_1009_chunk0)\nNo Americans are recorded to have contracted highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\n\n### Segment 55 (ID: seg_v5_16_1009_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 56 (ID: seg_v5_1_1008_chunk0)\nTyson Foods says it's ramping up biosecurity measures at its farms after a flock of chicken in Kentucky tested positive for the bird flu.\n\n### Segment 57 (ID: seg_v5_4_1008_chunk0)\nBird flu can cause high mortality rates among birds.\n\n### Segment 58 (ID: seg_v5_5_1008_chunk0)\nIn 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\n\n### Segment 59 (ID: seg_v5_6_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA said it detected the presence of the virus in an undisclosed number of birds from a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 60 (ID: seg_v5_7_1008_chunk0)\nThe agency [USDA] said Monday that \"birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease\" and that \"depopulation is complete in Virginia.\"\n\n### Segment 61 (ID: seg_v5_8_1008_chunk0)\nTyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_9_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA is awaiting results of a potential second case about 124 miles northeast in Webster County, Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_10_1008_chunk0)\nMeanwhile, a backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also tested positive for the virus.\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_1_1009_chunk0)\nA \"highly pathogenic\" form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_2_1009_chunk0)\nThe virus was detected in a small, non-commercial backyard block that was not being used for poultry purposes, the agency [USDA] said.\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_3_1009_chunk0)\nThe USDA said it is now \"working closely with state animal health officials in New York on a joint incident response,\" according to the statement.\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_4_1009_chunk0)\n\"State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n### Segment 68 (ID: seg_v5_5_1009_chunk0)\nBirds from the flock will not enter the food system.\"\n\n### Segment 69 (ID: seg_v5_6_1009_chunk0)\nNo human cases of avian influenza have been detected in the United States.\n\n### Segment 70 (ID: seg_v5_7_1009_chunk0)\nRecent detections of the virus [H5N1] in other states in February do not present an immediate health concern, the agency [USDA] said.\n\n### Segment 71 (ID: seg_v5_8_1009_chunk0)\n\"As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F kills bacteria and viruses,\" the USDA release on Saturday said.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_9_1009_chunk0)\n\"As part of existing avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock.\"\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_10_1009_chunk0)\nIt [the detection in New York] came after the virus was discovered in flocks of birds in Kentucky, Virginia, and Indiana.\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_2_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_3_1000_chunk0)\nThe latest outbreaks were reported just days after the U.S. ordered nearly 30,000 turkeys to be euthanized in Indiana after testing positive for the same H5N1 strain of the highly pathogenic disease.\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_4_1000_chunk0)\nThe latest outbreaks were reported just days after the U.S. ordered nearly 30,000 turkeys to be euthanized in Indiana after testing positive for the same H5N1 strain of the highly pathogenic disease. That outbreak [in Indiana] was the first case of bird flu found among a commercial poultry flock since 2020.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_5_1000_chunk0)\nAPHIS said Monday that the birds in the most recently infected flocks will also be quarantined and killed off, and that so far no human cases of the virus have been detected in the U.S.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_6_1000_chunk0)\nBirds from the flocks will not enter the food system,' APHIS said in a statement on Monday.\n\n### Segment 79 (ID: seg_v5_7_1000_chunk0)\nBirds from the flocks will not enter the food system,' APHIS said in a statement on Monday. 'The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations,' it [APHIS] added.\n\n### Segment 80 (ID: seg_v5_8_1000_chunk0)\nThe United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations,' it [APHIS] added. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added Monday that these virus detections [of bird flu] do not present an immediate public health concern.\n\n### Segment 81 (ID: seg_v5_9_1000_chunk0)\nAuthorities believe wild birds have been spreading the virus, after dozens recently tested positive for the flu along the East Coast, Reuters reported.\n\n### Segment 82 (ID: seg_v5_10_1000_chunk0)\nAPHIS urged Americans involved with poultry production from small-scale backyard operations to large commercial environments to review their biosecurity activities and prevent contact between their birds and wild bird populations.\n\n### Segment 83 (ID: seg_v5_11_101_chunk0)\nIt's [getting this virus] not impossible for humans to get this virus, but it's [getting this virus] been pretty rare,' Professor Kean said.\n\n### Segment 84 (ID: seg_v5_12_101_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it [CDC] had been monitoring people in the United States who were exposed to infected poultry and other birds.\n\n### Segment 85 (ID: seg_v5_13_101_chunk0)\nSo far, no cases of H5N1 infection have been found among them, the C.D.C. said.\n\n### Segment 86 (ID: seg_v5_14_101_chunk0)\nYes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has said that properly prepared and cooked poultry and eggs should not pose a risk to consumers.\n\n### Segment 87 (ID: seg_v5_16_101_chunk0)\nUnder federal guidelines, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, part of the U.S.D.A., is responsible for inspecting all poultry sold in interstate and foreign commerce.\n\n### Segment 88 (ID: seg_v5_17_101_chunk0)\nInspectors are required to be present at all times during the slaughtering process, according to the service, which noted that the inspectors have unfettered access to those facilities.\n\n### Segment 89 (ID: seg_v5_18_101_chunk0)\nEgg-production facilities that are subject to federal regulation are required to undergo daily inspections once per shift, according to the inspection service.\n\n### Segment 90 (ID: seg_v5_19_101_chunk0)\nState inspection programs, which inspect poultry products sold only within the state they were produced, are additionally monitored by the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 91 (ID: seg_v5_20_101_chunk0)\nBecause of the mandated culling of infected flocks, experts say, the virus is primarily an animal health issue at this time.\n\n### Segment 92 (ID: seg_v5_21_101_chunk0)\nStill, the U.S.D.A. recommends cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 Fahrenheit to reduce the potential for food-borne illness.\n\n### Segment 93 (ID: seg_v5_24_101_chunk0)\nRecently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 94 (ID: seg_v5_25_101_chunk0)\nIf infections course through more flocks, experts said, there could be some shortages of eggs.\n\n### Segment 95 (ID: seg_v5_26_101_chunk0)\nPrices for white and dark chicken meat were also rising, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 96 (ID: seg_v5_27_101_chunk0)\nExperts also warned that turkey prices could also become more volatile.\n\n### Segment 97 (ID: seg_v5_28_101_chunk0)\nTesting for the avian flu typically involves swabbing the mouths and tracheal area of chickens and turkeys.\n\n### Segment 98 (ID: seg_v5_29_101_chunk0)\nThe samples are sent to diagnostic labs to be analyzed.\n\n### Segment 99 (ID: seg_v5_30_101_chunk0)\nOutbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\n\n### Segment 100 (ID: seg_v5_32_101_chunk0)\nThe combined number of birds in the infected flocks -- the commercial and backyard type -- totaled more than 17 million, according to the agency.\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)\n#  -----------------------------------------------------------\n✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**\n1.

  "thoughts": "**Here's how I approached the task of identifying segments with bare negations according to Q7:**\n\nI went through each segment meticulously, carefully looking for specific phrases that qualify as \"bare negations.\" These included statements that denied an expected outcome or minimized risk, without offering additional reassurance or calming language. I checked for negations related to impact, risk, spread, concern, and detection. If I found such a negation, I then ensured that there wasn't a subsequent phrase that acted as an explicit calming cue (like assuring the audience of consumer safety).\n"
