  "thoughts": "**Q7 Decision Application: My Analysis of Text Segments**\n\nAlright, let's get down to business. My task is to go through 27 text segments and apply Q7 of the decision tree. I understand the goal: to identify and flag any \"bare negations\" - instances where the text denies something but doesn't offer any explicit calming language to reassure the reader. This will influence how we categorize the text's frame.\n\nEssentially, I'm hunting for phrases that directly negate something (e.g., \"not expected,\" \"no evidence\") *without* following up with a comforting explanation. If I find such a bare negation, it's a \"yes\" for Q7, and the frame is \"Neutral.\" If the negation *is* paired with calming language, then it's a \"no\" for Q7 (because the text is probably Reassuring, which would be handled by Q5/Q6). And if there's no negation at all, it's also a \"no\" for Q7, and I move on to the next question in the tree.\n\nI've been given a list of patterns to look for. I'm focusing on \"Expectation Negations\" (like \"not expected to cause problems\"), \"Evidence Negations\" (like \"no evidence\"), \"Risk Negations\" (like \"doesn't pose a risk\"), and \"Capability Negations\" (like \"cannot survive\"). There's also a specific phrase to watch for: \"do not present an immediate public-health concern.\"\n\nNow, here's the breakdown of my analysis for each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1-11 & 14-27:** For these segments, I found *no* instances of the specific negation patterns I'm looking for. Therefore, for all these segments, my answer is \"no\".\n\n*   **Segment 12:** This one jumped out at me. It contains the phrase \"not unexpected,\" which fits perfectly as an \"Expectation Negation.\" After I looked, I found *no* explicit calming language. \"Yes\" for Q7.\n\n*   **Segment 13:** This segment has \"No human infections... have been detected.\" This clearly falls under \"Evidence Negations.\" Again, no calming language is present. So, this is also a \"Yes\" for Q7.\n\nAnd that's it! After a thorough review, I'm confident in my analysis. I have processed each text segment and built a JSON array as per the instructions, with all the segments marked \"no\" except for segments 12 and 13, which I've marked \"yes\".\n"
