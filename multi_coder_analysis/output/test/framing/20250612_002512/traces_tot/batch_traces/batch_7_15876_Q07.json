seg_v5_4_1001_chunk0)\nBirds at a commercial turkey farm in Southern Indiana contracted the virus [avian flu] last week, forcing officials to cull 29,000 turkeys in an attempt to stop the spread.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_5_1001_chunk0)\nA backyard flock of mixed birds in Virginia had to be culled after they [the backyard flock] tested positive for avian flu.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_6_1001_chunk0)\nOfficials are also working to depopulate a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, that tested positive for the flu [avian flu].\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_7_1001_chunk0)\nTest results are still pending for a separate flock in Webster County.\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_8_1001_chunk0)\nThe culled birds will not enter the food system at a time when the agricultural industry is already being challenged by rising inflation and supply chain issues.\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_9_1001_chunk0)\nThe price index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs saw the largest increase among all food groups last month, rising 12.2% over January of last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_10_1001_chunk0)\nPoultry farms in Africa, Europe, and Asia are also dealing with avian flu.\n\n### Segment 68 (ID: seg_v5_1_10_chunk0)\nMore than 35,000 chickens are to be culled at a Dutch farm after a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu was discovered there, the agriculture ministry announced Thursday.\n\n### Segment 69 (ID: seg_v5_2_10_chunk0)\nThe outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\n\n### Segment 70 (ID: seg_v5_3_10_chunk0)\nThe government did not immediately report the exact strain of bird flu that infected chickens on the farm.\n\n### Segment 71 (ID: seg_v5_4_10_chunk0)\nThe agriculture ministry tightened controls Thursday around the infected farm in the village of Altforst, 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the capital, Amsterdam.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_5_10_chunk0)\nAnother 34 farms are situated within a 10-kilometer (6 mile) radius of the infected location.\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_6_10_chunk0)\nAuthorities banned the transport of any birds, eggs, manure, used straw and other animal products from the 10-kilometer ring around the infected farm.\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_2_1005_chunk0)\nThe new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_3_1005_chunk0)\nThe 29,000 turkeys in the flock were killed to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_4_1005_chunk0)\nThe poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_5_1005_chunk0)\nEgg, turkey and chicken prices could rise and availability could drop if birds at enough farms were to be infected.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_6_1005_chunk0)\n“It’s definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry,” said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association.\n\n### Segment 79 (ID: seg_v5_7_1005_chunk0)\n“I feel positive that we can tackle this situation better and I have my fingers crossed that this will be an isolated case, however, I would hope for the best and be prepared for the worst.”\n\n### Segment 80 (ID: seg_v5_8_1005_chunk0)\nHealth officials say no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S. and the disease doesn’t present an immediate public health concern.\n\n### Segment 81 (ID: seg_v5_9_1005_chunk0)\nThe 2015 outbreak led producers to kill 33 million egg-laying hens in Iowa, the nation’s leading egg producer, and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation’s leading turkey producer, with smaller outbreaks in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\n### Segment 82 (ID: seg_v5_2_1004_chunk0)\nThe United States Department of Agriculture confirmed Feb. 9 that a commercial turkey flock in Indiana was hit with avian flu, the first case in the U.S. since 2020.\n\n### Segment 83 (ID: seg_v5_3_1004_chunk0)\nThe entire flock of nearly 30,000 birds was euthanized in an effort to stop the spread.\n\n### Segment 84 (ID: seg_v5_4_1004_chunk0)\nThen on Feb. 14, the agency confirmed that a commercial flock of broiler chickens was hit with bird flu in Kentucky, and a backyard flock of mixed species fowl also tested positive in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 85 (ID: seg_v5_5_1004_chunk0)\nBoth flocks were culled.\n\n### Segment 86 (ID: seg_v5_7_1004_chunk0)\nNational Turkey Federation Vice President of Communications Beth Breeding told FOX Business that producers are focused on farm security every day and that members remain vigilant and practice all biosecurity protocols.\n\n### Segment 87 (ID: seg_v5_8_1004_chunk0)\nShe [Beth Breeding] said that for farms within a 10km control zone of confirmed bird flu cases, regular testing is taking place to monitor the health of flocks.\n\n### Segment 88 (ID: seg_v5_9_1004_chunk0)\nA spokesperson from the USDA told FOX Business that the agency recently expanded its wild bird surveillance after the first detection of HPAI in a wild bird in the U.S., and that the surveillance of wild birds ensures that both the agency and the poultry industry are able to enhance biosecurity measures and rapidly respond to reduce the risk of disease spread.\n\n### Segment 89 (ID: seg_v5_10_1004_chunk0)\nThe spokesperson said that bird owners (whether it’s commercial or backyard poultry, or pet or hobby birds), should take some simple steps to protect their birds from the virus:\n\n### Segment 90 (ID: seg_v5_12_1006_chunk0)\nThe virus is spread by migratory birds and waterfowl, usually this time of year.\n\n### Segment 91 (ID: seg_v5_13_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods is prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing,' the company said in an emailed statement.\n\n### Segment 92 (ID: seg_v5_14_1006_chunk0)\nPlans include additional restrictions on access to farms and continuing to test each flock for avian influenza before it is processed.\n\n### Segment 93 (ID: seg_v5_15_1006_chunk0)\nFarms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\n\n### Segment 94 (ID: seg_v5_16_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\n\n### Segment 95 (ID: seg_v5_21_1005_chunk0)\nFederal and state officials are working with the poultry industry and have initiated steps such as an immediate quarantine that restricts movement of poultry and equipment used to move birds in and out of specified perimeters around an infected barn usually around 6 miles initially and eradication of the virus by killing and removing birds at the infection site.\n\n### Segment 96 (ID: seg_v5_22_1005_chunk0)\nTesting occurs in the quarantine area of both wild and domestic birds.\n\n### Segment 97 (ID: seg_v5_23_1005_chunk0)\nDisinfection is done to kill the virus [H5N1] at the affected farm and testing is used to confirm it’s free of the virus [H5N1].\n\n### Segment 98 (ID: seg_v5_24_1005_chunk0)\nProducers who want to ensure eligibility for government indemnity payments in case of disaster must have a biosecurity protocol on hand that is updated regularly.\n\n### Segment 99 (ID: seg_v5_25_1005_chunk0)\nTo help with that [ensuring eligibility for government indemnity payments/having a biosecurity protocol], the USDA has developed a 14-point biosecurity plan for producers, which is audited yearly and reviewed every two years by state agriculture agencies, Sato said.\n\n### Segment 100 (ID: seg_v5_26_1005_chunk0)\nIn Iowa, a state with 49 million chickens, egg farmers are working with state and federal authorities to keep the disease out of their flocks, said Kevin Stiles, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association and the Iowa Egg Council.\n\n\n#

  "thoughts": "**Applying Q7: Identifying Bare Negations**\n\nAs an expert in risk communication, my focus is to apply Q7 from the decision tree to a list of segments.  Q7 specifically flags \"bare negations\" – statements using negative constructions that, without accompanying calming cues, could be perceived as neutral (neither reassuring nor alarming). The goal is to identify segments where a negative statement, such as \"no risk\" or \"does not affect,\" is presented without additional context that would soften or reframe it.\n\nI've carefully reviewed each segment, using my expertise to discern the nuanced use of negation. The segments that warranted a \"yes\" response to Q7 are listed below:\n\n1.  **seg_v5_12_1001_chunk0:** \"There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses...\" This is an \"Evidence Negation,\" stating a lack of evidence without providing additional context to neutralize the implication.\n2.  **seg_v5_13_1004_chunk0:** \"...it [the virus] does not present a food safety risk...\" This directly negates a potential concern (\"Risk Negation\") but offers no additional information.\n3.  **seg_v5_012_1003_chunk0:** \"...the cases do not present an immediate public health concern...\" This negates a potential public health issue (\"Risk Negation\"), without offering any additional context.\n4.  **seg_v5_15_1002_chunk0:** \"No Americans are recorded to have contracted highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\" This is an \"Evidence Negation,\" stating a lack of evidence without providing additional context to neutralize the implication.\n5.  **seg_v5_5_100_chunk0:** \"...the cases in birds do not present an immediate public health concern.\" This negates a potential public health issue (\"Risk Negation\"), without offering any additional context.\n6.  **seg_v5_006_1003_chunk0:** \"...will not enter the food system...\" This explicitly negates a risk (\"Risk Negation\") without any qualifying statements.\n7.  **seg_v5_008_1003_chunk0:** \"The outbreak is not expected to lower overall chicken production levels...\" This expresses a lack of expectation of a negative outcome (\"Expectation Negation\") without offering additional clarification.\n8.  **seg_v5_3_1002_chunk0:** \"...these avian influenza detections do not present an immediate public health concern.\" This negates a potential public health issue (\"Risk Negation\"), without offering any additional context.\n9.  **seg_v5_4_1002_chunk0:** \"\"No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.\"\" This is an \"Evidence Negation,\" stating a lack of evidence without providing additional context to neutralize the implication.\n10. **seg_v5_14_1005_chunk0:** \"...they [migratory wild birds] don't kill the birds.\" This is a \"Capability Negation\". No explicit calming cue follows.\n11. **seg_v5_3_1001_chunk0:** \"...it [avian flu] does not cause any symptoms in wild birds...\" This negates a risk (\"Risk Negation\"). No explicit calming cue follows.\n12. **seg_v5_8_1001_chunk0:** \"...will not enter the food system.\" This explicitly negates a risk (\"Risk Negation\") without any qualifying statements.\n13. **seg_v5_8_1005_chunk0:** \"...no human cases... have been detected\" and \"...doesn't present an immediate public health concern.\" Both are bare negations ('Evidence Negation' and 'Risk Negation').\n\nThese segments are identified as *Neutral* under the Q7 criterion.\n"
