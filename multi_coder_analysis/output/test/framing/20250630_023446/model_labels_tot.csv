The number \""159\"" is, well, just a number - a neutral piece of data.\n\nNone of the vocabulary in this sentence aligns with the hallmarks of high-potency framing.

In this case, \""tested positive\"" and \""has been found\"" don't fit the 'moderate verb' list. Further, the 'impact' is a consequence but not described by a moderate verb. \""Tested positive\"" is a binary result. \""Found in more than 40 states\"" is a statement of scope, and \""found\"" isn't on my Q3 moderate verb list.\n\nTherefore, because the segment fails to contain any of the specific \""moderate verbs\"" required by Q3, my assessment is straightforward.

No potent metaphors. \""Unusual mortality event\"" doesn't work as a \""critical alert phrase,\"" as it's a *definition* within the field. \""Sparking\"" is, by itself, a \""neutral verb.\"" \""The term is likely to be alarmist only if used in a specific metaphor.\"" So, based on my analysis, Q2 is a \""no\"" for me.\n""}, {""Q"": 3, ""answer"": ""uncertain"", ""rationale"": ""The segment contains 'dozens' (quantity) and 'sparking' (psychological verb), but neither fits the Q3 pattern of a moderate verb from the list paired with scale/impact as defined."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""batch_id"": ""single"", ""batch_size"": 1, ""batch_pos"": 1, ""statement_text"": ""The deaths of dozens of seals off the coast of Maine has been deemed an 'unusual mortality event,' sparking a federal investigation into strandings that appear linked to avian influenza."", ""article_id"": 188, ""thoughts"": ""**Q3 Analysis - Not a Match**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and trying to see if it triggers Q3 of the decision tree. Q3 wants me to find a \""moderate verb\"" from that specific list, directly paired with some clear indication of \""scale or impact.\"" I need to see one of those verbs directly linked to some tangible measure of the harm or magnitude.\n\nFirst, I'm identifying the segment: \""The deaths of dozens of seals off the coast of Maine has been deemed an 'unusual mortality event,' sparking a federal investigation into strandings that appear linked to avian influenza.\""\n\nNext, I'm going through the list of \""moderate verbs.\""  I'm seeing \""deemed\"" and \""sparking.\"" \""Deemed\"" isn't on the list, so it's out. \""Sparking\"" is a psychological verb, which means I have to apply that special sub-rule. The rule says that these are neutral *unless* paired with a vivid intensifier of public reaction (like \""mass panic\"") or a concrete scale of *realised* harm (like \""5 million birds died\"").\n\nLet's look at \""sparking.\"" It's paired with \""a federal investigation.\"" That's not a vivid intensifier, nor is it a concrete measure of harm. It's an action in response to the event. So, according to the rule, \""sparking\"" is neutral here.\n\nNow, I'm checking for scale or impact. I've got \""dozens of seals,\"" \""'unusual mortality event,'\"" \""federal investigation,\"" and \""strandings.\"" \""Dozens\"" is a quantity, but it's linked to the noun \""deaths.\"" That doesn't fit the Q3 pattern, which needs a verb from the specific list *directly* paired with the scale.  \""'Unusual mortality event'\"" is a technical label. \""Federal investigation\"" is an action, and \""strandings\"" just describes the event. None of these really act as scale indicators in the Q3 sense.\n\nFinally, I ask if there's *any* direct pairing of a verb from the list with scale information in the way Q3 demands. \""Sparking\"" isn't a \""moderate verb\"" here; it's neutral. \""Deaths\"" is paired with \""dozens,\"" but that's a noun-quantity pairing, not the verb-scale pairing I need.\n\nTherefore, looking at the Q3 criteria, I'm concluding that this segment *does not* meet the pattern.\n""}]"
