Q1 is all about spotting intensifiers and comparative adjectives modifying risk adjectives. Basically, is someone cranking up the negativity with words like \"very dangerous\" or \"extremely severe\"?\n\nI see \"very low,\" and \"very\" is definitely an intensifier. But *low*... that's the rub, isn't it? The examples they give for *risk-adjectives* – deadly, dangerous, severe, catastrophic – are all explicitly negative. They're adjectives that amplify a danger or threat. The rule itself is pretty clear: it's about \"authorial use of intensifiers ... coupled with high-valence negative adjectives...\"\n\n\"Low,\" however, isn't a high-valence negative. It's not *bad*. It's actually a positive thing. It *describes a lack of danger*. I'm looking for a pattern that signals an \"Alarmist\" frame, one that's designed to raise concerns. \"Very low\" is the *opposite* of that – it's reassuring.\n\nSo, while there's an intensifier, it's not modifying the kind of *risk-adjective* Q1 is looking for. Q1 is designed to find those amplified negative risks that signal an alarmist view.

Looking at the text, the key verb is \"is,\" as in \"The risk to humans **is** very low.\"  Now, Q3 specifically looks for \"moderate verbs.\" We've got our defined list of moderate verbs, and a regex ready if needed, and \"is\" is not included in it.

However, looking at the rules, I see that the \"Low-Risk Evaluation (+ Intensifier)\" doesn't explicitly restrict the source.
