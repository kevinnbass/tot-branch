{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "Segment contains no intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk adjectives, nor fixed lethal idioms.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "So far, there have been no confirmed human-to-human transfers though three people in the U.S. were infected after exposure to infected cattle since April 1.", "article_id": 1683, "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment for Risk Claim Framing**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. The user wants me to act as an expert claim-framing coder, essentially using this decision tree to analyze a piece of text. The first step, Q1, focuses on identifying intensified or comparative risk language. Let's see... the segment is: \"So far, there have been no confirmed human-to-human transfers though three people in the U.S. were infected after exposure to infected cattle since April 1.\"\n\nMy initial thought process is to break this down. The core of my analysis centers on the presence of intensifiers and comparatives combined with risk adjectives. The decision tree provides these examples: \"so deadly,\" \"very dangerous\" for intensifiers, and \"more deadly,\" \"deadlier\" for comparatives. It also includes fixed lethal-from-outset idioms.\n\nLooking at the segment, I quickly realize it doesn't contain any of these explicit markers. \"No confirmed human-to-human transfers\" is simply a negation of that transmission pathway. \"Three people were infected\" is factual, reporting a case count. \"Exposure to infected cattle\" describes the method of infection.\n\nThere's no language indicating intensification of risk (like \"very\" or \"extremely\") and no comparisons (\"more dangerous\"). Additionally, there are no idioms that imply the inherent lethal nature of the subject matter. Therefore, based on the decision tree's criteria, the answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" It's on to the next step of the analysis.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "No high-potency verbs, superlatives + negative nouns, critical alert phrases, potent metaphors, or intensifier + harm nouns are present.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "So far, there have been no confirmed human-to-human transfers though three people in the U.S. were infected after exposure to infected cattle since April 1.", "article_id": 1683, "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment for Alarmist Cues**\n\nOkay, I've been given a text segment and the task is clear: I need to scrutinize it for any signs of alarmist language according to the Q2 guidelines. Based on my expertise, I'm already mentally running through the checklist.\n\nFirst, I examined the verbs. \"Infected\" is used, but it's a descriptive, moderate verb, not one of those high-potency words like \"ravaged\" or \"devastated.\" So, Q2.1 is a no-go.\n\nNext, I looked for superlatives paired with negative nouns â€“ thinking \"worst crisis\" or \"most devastating,\" you know. But nothing like that is present. Q2.2 is also a pass.\n\nThen, I scanned for critical alert phrases, phrases that immediately signal heightened concern. Nothing like \"on high alert\" or similar. Q2.3: negative.\n\nI mentally looked for metaphors, imagery that might stoke fear - something like a \"ticking time-bomb\". Nothing. Q2.4: negative.\n\nFinally, I checked for intensifiers combined with nouns indicating harm. Again, no intensifiers paired with words like \"mortality\" or \"disaster\". So, Q2.5 is also a negative.\n\nTherefore, after a thorough review based on my knowledge of alarmist cues, my conclusion is clear: This segment does not contain any alarmist language as defined by Q2. The answer is definitively \"no\".\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with scale or quantity.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "So far, there have been no confirmed human-to-human transfers though three people in the U.S. were infected after exposure to infected cattle since April 1.", "article_id": 1683, "thoughts": "**Assessing the Q3 Trigger**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and tasked with determining if it activates a Q3 pattern. My expertise immediately kicks in, and I start dissecting the provided text with a laser focus. The prompt explicitly defines Q3 patterns as requiring a \"Moderate Verb (past-tense) + Scale/Quantity\".\n\nThe segment is \"So far, there have been no confirmed human-to-human transfers though three people in the U.S. were infected after exposure to infected cattle since April 1.\" I break it down, element by element. \"No confirmed human-to-human transfers\" is a flat negation (Q7), it doesn't fit the Q3 bill. The phrase \"three people in the U.S. were infected\" intrigues me. \"Infected\" *is* a verb, but is it a *moderate* one?\n\nMy expert knowledge tells me 'no'. The verb \"infected\" describes a state, an outcome. It's not an active verb like \"spiked\" or \"surged\" that reflects a rapid change or forceful impact, which is what Q3 is looking for. Even if \"infected\" fit, \"three people\" is a quantity, not a *scale/quantity* like \"million\" or \"%\".  Finally, \"after exposure to infected cattle since April 1\" just sets the context. It offers no Q3 triggers.\n\nGiven this thorough analysis, the answer is a clear \"no\". No Q3 pattern is triggered in this segment.\n"}
