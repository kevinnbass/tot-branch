This means I'm looking for Intensifiers and Risk-Adj words.  I need to scan for words like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"dangerous,\" or any fixed lethal-from-the-outset idioms.\n\nLet's see...  \"Full results of genetic analysis of the sample are pending.\" Hmm.  It's a straightforward statement, really.  No alarm bells going off here.  I don't see any of those Intensifiers or Risk-Adj words.  It's just a factual update about the analysis.\n\nNope, no flags. Q1 is a clear \"no.\"  I'll move on to the next stage of the analysis, Q2, as per the established process.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "Segment contains no high-potency verbs, superlatives + negative nouns, critical alert phrases, potent metaphors, or intensifiers + harm nouns.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "Full results of genetic analysis of the sample are pending.", "article_id": 690, "thoughts": "**My Analysis: Is This Alarmist?**\n\nOkay, I've got this segment: \"Full results of genetic analysis of the sample are pending.\" My task is to determine if it uses any of those alarmist cues outlined in the Hop Q2 rules. I'll break it down step-by-step. First, a quick read-through. Seems straightforward enough. No obvious red flags jumping out.\n\nNow, let's systematically check each of the Q2 patterns. First up, **High-Potency Verbs**. Does it use anything like \"ravaged\" or \"devastated\"? Nope. Nothing like that in sight. Moving on to **Superlative + Negative Nouns**. \"Worst crisis,\" \"most dangerous\"? Nothing even close. Then, the **Critical Alert Phrases**. \"On high alert,\" \"breaking news\"? Not here. Next up are **Potent Metaphors**. No \"ticking time-bombs\" or \"nightmare scenarios\" present. Finally, I'll look for **Intensifiers + Harm Nouns**. \"Very high losses,\" \"extreme crisis\"? Again, nothing like that.\n\nAfter checking all those criteria, it's clear: this segment doesn't contain any of the alarmist patterns defined in Q2. Therefore, I can confidently answer \"no.\"\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "Segment contains no moderate verbs describing impact or change, nor any scale or quantity.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "Full results of genetic analysis of the sample are pending.", "article_id": 690, "thoughts": "**Analyzing for the Q3 Pattern**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with determining if the phrase \"Full results of genetic analysis of the sample are pending\" fits the Q3 pattern. I know Q3 focuses on moderate verbs that imply change or impact, paired with some indication of scale.\n\nLet's break it down. First, I have to identify the verb in the sentence. Here, it's \"are pending.\"  And immediately, my expert eye tells me this isn't a *doing* verb. It's a state of being. It's not like \"surged\" or \"plummeted,\" verbs that convey some kind of significant change. I'm looking for verbs of impact, and \"pending\" doesn't fit the bill.\n\nNext, I need to check for any mention of scale or quantity. Is there a percentage? A record high? A specific number? Nope. Just \"full results,\" which doesn't quantify or scale the situation in the Q3 sense.\n\nTherefore, because there's no moderate verb from the list and no hint of scale, I'm confident in concluding that this segment *does not* trigger the Q3 pattern.\n"}
