{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'definitely' modifying the risk adjective 'high risk'.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Initial Assessment: Q1 of the 12-Step Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user wants me to apply Q1 from that decision tree to the following segment: *\"Itâ€™s definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry,\" said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association.*\n\nRight, so Q1 is all about those intensifiers or comparatives that modify risk adjectives, or that fixed idiom, \"deadly from the start/outset\". Let's break it down: \"It's definitely considered a period of high risk\". \"High risk\" is clearly a risk adjective. And \"definitely\"... yep, that's an intensifier. Bingo. It's the \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj\" pattern.\n\nI also see \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\" there, but I'm trained to ignore those technical terms unless there are further alarmist cues. The technical-term guard is up.\n\nSo, bottom line? The phrase *\"definitely considered a period of high risk\"* immediately highlights the key cue. The answer to Q1 is a definite \"yes\". The user should flag that.\n"}
