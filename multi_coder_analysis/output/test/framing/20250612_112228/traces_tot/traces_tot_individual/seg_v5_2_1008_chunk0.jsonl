{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to apply Q1 of the 12-step decision tree to this text snippet: \"To date, the company is only aware of one affected house at a farm in Fulton County, Kentucky, which is one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for the company.\"  My job is to see if there's an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk adjective. That means I need to be on the lookout for those specific words like \"so,\" \"very,\" \"more,\" \"less,\" and \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" etc., and also be wary of the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\"\n\nI'll break it down sentence by sentence. \"To date, the company is only aware of one affected house...\" Seems straightforward, just stating a fact.  No red flags there.  Moving on to \"...at a farm in Fulton County, Kentucky, which is one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for the company.\" Again, just context, nothing that seems to fit the pattern of Q1.\n\nBasically, I'm not seeing any of the indicators I'm looking for. No intensifiers, no comparatives, and no risk-adjectives. This is a pretty simple statement of fact. So, my conclusion is that the answer to Q1 is definitely \"no.\"\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the moderate verb 'affected' and contains no high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: Not Alarming**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment: \"To date, the company is only aware of one affected house at a farm in Fulton County, Kentucky, which is one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for the company.\" The task is to see if it triggers any red flags according to Q2 of the decision tree.  Specifically, I'm checking for language that's designed to make things sound *worse* than they are.\n\nRight off the bat, I scan for the big ones: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlatives paired with negative nouns, or that classic \"on high alert\" phrase.  I'm not seeing anything that really jumps out. \"Aware,\" \"affected,\" and \"raise\" are the verbs in play, and while \"affected\" does suggest *some* impact, it's not the same level of alarm as something like \"devastated\" or \"ravaged.\"  There are no metaphors, and no superlatives either.\n\nI consulted my mental checklist and \"affected\" falls into the category of \"Moderate Verb (alone).\" Neutral is the default.\n\nTherefore, given the lack of these cues, I'd have to say the answer to Q2 is a resounding \"no.\" We move on to Q3 normally, but for the user's purposes, Q2 is all they need.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'affected' is explicitly excluded from the list of moderate verbs for Q3.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Assessing for Significant Scale or Impact**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and need to see if it triggers Q3 of the decision tree. That means I need to look for a \"moderate verb\" from the approved list, *specifically* linked to information about scale or impact.\n\nMy initial scan picks up on the word \"affected\".  Now, I need to consult my rules - the approved list, really. I immediately recall that \"Plain factual verbs killed / died / affected / reported / euthanized / depopulated do not qualify.\" My notes are very clear on that point.\n\nGiven that \"affected\" is explicitly *excluded* from the approved list for this purpose, I'm confident in saying that the answer to Q3 is a straightforward \"no\". There's no qualifying \"moderate verb\" present that's linked with the relevant contextual information.\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no questions, rhetorical or otherwise.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Loaded Rhetoric**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this snippet: \"To date, the company is only aware of one affected house at a farm in Fulton County, Kentucky, which is one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for the company.\" The task is to apply Q4 – is there a loaded rhetorical question here designed to incite alarm?\n\nMy first step is to quickly scan for any questions. I'm trained to spot those immediately – the telltale question mark, or phrasing like \"Are we safe?\" or \"Should we be concerned?\" But, looking at the text, I see none of that. It's a straightforward statement about the company's knowledge regarding a single affected farm. No question marks, no implications of fear or worry directly stated.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q4 is unequivocally \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the provided segment doesn't contain a single question, let alone a rhetorical one designed to provoke a specific emotional response. My analysis is complete.\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a positive fact (only one affected house out of thousands) but lacks explicit calming language or safety assurances.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Assessing for Explicit Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment, and the task is to run it against Q5 of the 12-step decision tree. This means I'm looking for those *explicit* calming cues, those statements that directly communicate safety, control, or a significantly reduced present risk. Think phrases like, \"no cause for alarm,\" \"rest assured,\" \"situation contained,\" the usual reassurance signals.\n\nThe segment itself? It simply states a fact: \"To date, the company is only aware of one affected house at a farm in Fulton County, Kentucky, which is one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for the company.\"\n\nNow, this *is* a positive fact. One affected house out of thousands? That's definitely limited scope. It *implies* a low overall risk. But it doesn't *say* that directly. There's no \"no need to worry\" here, no \"we've got this under control.\" It's neutral. We need explicit reassurance, and this just doesn't deliver it. I'm not seeing any confidence statements, safety assurances, or amplified low-risk evaluations. It's just a statement of fact.\n\nSo, in my professional opinion, the answer to Q5 is a resounding **no**. The segment reports a positive fact but lacks the *explicit* calming language necessary to meet the criteria for reassurance as defined by Q5.\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'only aware of one affected house' combined with 'thousands of farms' uses a minimiser and scale contrast for reassurance.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q6 Application & Reassuring Frame**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment and I've been asked to apply Q6, which is all about spotting that 'minimiser + scale contrast' combo that points to a Reassuring frame.  My initial thought is to zero in on those key elements.\n\nFirst, I spotted the minimiser - \"only\". That \"only aware of one affected house\" jumped out at me immediately. Perfect, that's step one.\n\nThen, I scanned for that scale contrast. Bingo! The sentence clearly lays it out: \"one affected house\" versus \"thousands of farms.\"  It's a classic example of highlighting something small against a much larger scale.\n\nNow, the crucial check: do these two elements *work* together?  Absolutely. That \"only\" is doing the heavy lifting, downplaying the significance of that single affected house by contrasting it against the sheer scale of the company's chicken farms.  It's a textbook Reassuring frame.\n\nTo summarize, the cues are “only aware of one affected house” and contrasting it with “thousands of farms”. Q6 is met, and it's a clear-cut case of a Reassuring frame.\n"}
