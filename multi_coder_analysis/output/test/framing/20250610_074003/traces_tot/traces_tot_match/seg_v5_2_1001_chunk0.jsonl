{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment: A Claim-Framing Perspective**\n\nOkay, here's my assessment of the text segment \"Dozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month,\" keeping in mind the 12-step decision tree and the goal of expert claim-framing coding. I'm focusing on the first question, Q1: does it use intensifiers or comparatives with risk adjectives?\n\nFirst, I need to methodically check the segment against the criteria for Q1. This involves carefully scanning for the following patterns: \"Intensifier + Risk-Adjective,\" \"Comparative + Risk-Adjective,\" or \"Fixed Lethal-from-Outset Idiom.\" My expertise in claim-framing allows me to immediately recognize the nuances here. I'm looking for phrases like \"so dangerous,\" \"very deadly,\" \"more severe,\" \"deadlier,\" and other variations.\n\nNow, let's dissect the segment: \"Dozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\"  \"Dozens\" indicates quantity, but isn't an intensifier or a risk adjective. \"Tested positive\" is a factual statement about test results, crucial information, but not what I'm looking for in terms of framing. The location and timeframe elements are context. \"Including three in the Carolinas\" is specific data. The whole segment is well written, but it doesn't meet the Q1 conditions.\n\nBased on my analysis, I confidently conclude that the segment does *not* contain any instances of the identified patterns. There are no intensifiers like \"so,\" \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or \"highly\" modifying risk adjectives such as \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" \"catastrophic,\" \"brutal,\" \"contagious,\" \"virulent,\" or \"destructive.\" Nor are there comparative forms like \"more\" or \"deadlier\" being used in this manner. The fixed idiom is also absent.  My expert evaluation necessitates answering \"no\" to Q1."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('tested positive') and factual details ('dozens', 'three') without high-potency verbs, metaphors, or other Q2 cues.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against Q2**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment: \"Dozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\" My task is to assess it against question Q2 of the 12-step decision tree. Essentially, I'm checking for alarmist language, specifically high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative noun constructions, or the phrase \"on high alert.\"\n\nLet's break it down. \"Dozens of wild birds have tested positive\" is a straightforward statement of fact. \"Tested positive\" is a neutral phrase, not a high-impact verb. \"Dozens\" indicates a quantity, but it doesn't convey any sense of crisis or urgency.  \"Along the East Coast\" gives us the location, which is important context, but not alarmist. \"In recent weeks\" provides a timeframe, again, neutral. And finally, \"including three in the Carolinas last month\" provides a specific data point, which is factual and relevant but lacks the hyperbolic language I'm looking for.\n\nIn short, there's nothing here that triggers Q2. No \"ravaged,\" no \"ticking time-bomb,\" no \"most expensive disaster,\" and certainly no \"on high alert.\"  Therefore, the answer to Q2 is unequivocally \"no.\"  I'll need to move on to the next question in the decision tree, but since the prompt only asks for Q2, that's where I'll stop."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verbs 'have tested positive' and 'including' are not on the list of moderate verbs that trigger Q3.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Question Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment: \"Dozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\" My task is to determine if this triggers the alarmist frame based on Question Q3 of the decision tree. Q3 wants me to find \"moderate verbs\" paired with \"significant scale or impact.\"\n\nFirst, I need to pinpoint any verbs in the text. I see \"have tested positive\" and \"including\". Now comes the crucial step: checking these verbs against my Q3's list/regex of moderate verbs.  I compare them to things like *hit, swept, surged, soared, plunged, plummeted, prompted, feared, fearing, or were/was culled*.  Hmm, \"tested\" and \"including\" aren't on that list.\n\nSince the verbs don't meet the Q3 criteria, the answer to Q3 is a clear \"no.\" The alarmist frame isn't triggered here based on this question. I'm now ready to move on to the next question, Q4, but for this step, all I need to provide is the JSON for Q3."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement of fact and does not contain any question, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment: No Loaded Rhetorical Question Detected**\n\nOkay, so I need to assess this text segment against Q4 of my decision tree. The goal is to determine if it contains a loaded rhetorical question that's designed to alarm or instill a sense of urgency.\n\nThe segment I'm looking at is: \"Dozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\"\n\nFirst, I quickly scan it for any question marks or question-like phrasing. Hmm, nothing. It's a straightforward declarative sentence stating facts about bird testing. No question is being posed here.\n\nSince there's no question to begin with, I can confidently say the segment *doesn't* contain a loaded rhetorical question designed to create alarm. My answer is unequivocally \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the segment doesn't contain a question."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (birds testing positive) but contains no explicit calming language or cues from the author or a source.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and need to evaluate it against Question 5. This question, as I understand it, looks specifically for overt reassuring language, explicit \"calming cues\" that signal things are safe, controlled, or the risk is low. The text provided is: \"Dozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\"\n\nMy initial thought is to scan for those reassuring phrases. Things like \"no need to worry,\" \"everything is under control,\" \"the public is safe,\" or \"risk is minimal.\" This segment is a straightforward report of a negative fact: positive bird test results, along with specific numbers and locations. There's no attempt to downplay the situation or assure anyone of their safety. It's just a statement of fact.\n\nThe Bedrock Principle and Symmetry Rule come into play here. Negative facts, stated neutrally, are *neutral* in terms of alarm or reassurance. Q5, however, is all about *explicit* reassurance. The rules are clear: I'm looking for direct calming language. It's not about whether the information is inherently good or bad, but how it's presented. And this segment is presented neutrally.\n\nTherefore, after reviewing the text, my conclusion is that there are *no* explicit calming cues. No phrases, wording, or tone that would qualify as explicitly reassuring. I'll need to move on to the next question, but for this step, my JSON response to Q5 will indicate a \"no\" answer, with a rationale explaining the absence of any explicit reassuring language."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'Dozens' and 'three', but neither is presented with a minimiser ('only', 'just', 'few') nor explicitly contrasted with a larger scale ('out of X') to create a reassuring frame.", "thoughts": "**Evaluation of Text Segment for Q6 Criteria**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with checking this segment against Q6 of the decision tree. My focus is on identifying \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" used for reassurance. The segment is: \"Dozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\"\n\nMy analysis goes like this: First, I need to see if there's a minimiser word. \"Dozens\" seems significant, not minimizing. It's about a specific quantity, not suggesting a small number. Then I hit \"three\". A bare number like that doesn't count as a minimiser. The rules are clear on that. There's no \"only\", \"just\", or \"few\" preceding it. So, no minimiser identified so far.\n\nNext, the contrast. It does break down the numbers geographically (\"Dozens... East Coast,\" \"three in Carolinas\"). But it doesn't really scale the numbers down. There's no \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions\" to diminish the impact. It's just stating facts.\n\nSo, according to my expert understanding of the nuances here:\n\n*   \"Dozens\" is not a minimiser, and \"three\" is only a number\n*   There's no actual scale being referenced, so no contrast to speak of.\n\nBased on this, this segment *doesn't* meet the Q6 criteria. I'll confidently answer \"no,\" and I will explicitly explain the absence of a genuine minimiser word and the absence of scale contrast used for reassurance."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports positive test results ('have tested positive') and does not contain any form of bare negation or denial of risk/impact.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of \"Dozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\" in Relation to Q7**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown. I'm tasked with checking if the provided text segment contains a \"bare negation\" according to the criteria defined in Q7 of the decision tree. Remember, a bare negation downplays or denies a risk or problem without any calming cues.\n\nFirst, I need to scan the text for any negative words or phrases. I'm looking for telltale signs like \"not,\" \"no,\" \"unlikely,\" or any phrasing that directly contradicts or minimizes a potential problem.\n\nUpon review, I see that the segment *actually* describes positive test results. It states, and I quote, \"dozens of wild birds have tested positive...\" This is a factual statement of *positive* findings. My expert intuition immediately flags that as the opposite of what I'm looking for. It doesn't contain any negation.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by going through the examples provided in Q7. The patterns I'm looking for include phrases like \"not expected,\" \"no human cases,\" \"unlikely to affect,\" etc. The segment doesn't match *any* of those. It does not deny or downplay anything.\n\nIn fact, the segment isn't even about *negating* risk, but describing occurrences.\n\nSo, the answer is clear: the segment does *not* contain a bare negation. My conclusion, therefore, is \"no.\" This means I move onto the next hop. Given that the prompt only asks about Q7, my work is done."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (birds testing positive) and does not describe capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports numerical metrics ('Dozens', 'three') using standard descriptive verbs ('tested positive') without vivid verbs or risk adjectives.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Q9**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text and need to evaluate it against Q9. My initial thought is to break down what Q9 is actually asking. It wants to know if the segment is primarily reporting prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics using standard, descriptive verbs. I see the segment reporting the number of birds testing positive (\"Dozens,\" \"three\") and that immediately registers as a numerical metric, even though it's not directly related to prices or economic data.\n\nThe verbs used (\"have tested positive\" and \"including\") are standard, descriptive verbs. There's nothing particularly vivid or alarmist about them. I'm noting that the core subject isn't directly financial; it's about disease spread in wildlife. However, Q9 does include \"other numerical metrics,\" which is a bit of a gray area. I need to consider whether a count of positive test results falls under that category.\n\nMy understanding of the Q9's intent is to identify neutral reporting of quantitative data, specifically avoiding alarmist or reassuring framing through verb choice or adjectives. And that's where things get interesting. This segment *does* report a numerical metric factually (\"Dozens\", \"three\") using standard verbs (\"tested positive\"). Crucially, it doesn't use vivid verbs or risk adjectives to amplify the impact of those numbers.\n\nI'm thinking about the precedence ladder. Q1-Q3 are about vivid language, scale, and intensifiers, often pointing to Alarmist. Q4 is Explicit Calming (Reassuring). Q5 is Bare Negation/Capability (Neutral). Q6 is Default (Neutral). Q9 isn't on the Precedence Ladder; it's a check within the process, likely leading to Neutral if true. In this case, the segment is reporting facts, the number of birds testing positive and using standard language.\n\nNow, if Q9 is *broadly* interpreted to include *any* factual reporting of numerical metrics with standard verbs, then this segment absolutely fits. The metric is the count of positive tests, the verbs are standard, and there's no attempt to sensationalize or downplay the numbers.\n\nI'm considering the alternative path. If Q9 *only* applies to economic/price data, then the segment would skip Q9 and likely head toward Neutral, because Q1-Q3 would be \"no\" (no vivid language), Q4 would be \"no\" (no explicit calming), Q5 would be \"no\" (no bare negation/capability), and it would end up at Q6 (Default), which results in a Neutral classification.\n\nUltimately, whether I take a broad or narrow view of Q9, the outcome seems to be Neutral. But I have to follow the decision tree strictly. Since Q9 does specify \"other numerical metrics\" I am leaning towards including the counts of positive tests in that category. The segment *does* report numerical metrics (\"Dozens\", \"three\") using standard, descriptive verbs (\"tested positive\"). There are no vivid verbs or risk adjectives used to frame the impact of the numbers.\n\nTherefore, the segment fits the criteria for Q9: factual reporting of numerical metrics with standard, descriptive verbs, and no explicit alarmist or reassuring framing. The key indicators are the numerical metrics and the neutral verb choice."}
