{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the phrase 'highly lethal', which is an intensifier ('highly') directly modifying a risk-adjective ('lethal').", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Claim Framing - Q1**\n\nOkay, I'm analyzing this text segment against the Q1 criteria of the claim framing decision tree. The goal is to see if it contains an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective. Here's what I see:\n\nThe text segment is: \"They [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\"\n\nI need to apply my knowledge of the patterns, specifically looking for `(intensifier|comparative) + risk-adjective`.  I see the phrase \"highly lethal\". I know from my experience that \"highly\" functions as an intensifier, and \"lethal\" is indeed a risk-adjective, as defined by the guidelines. \"Highly lethal\" is even given as an explicit example in the rules, confirming that this fits the pattern.\n\nThe rules are clear on this: phrases like \"highly lethal\" trigger an \"Alarmist\" frame.  The \"Technical-term guard\" about \"highly pathogenic\" doesn't apply here, as \"highly lethal\" is distinct and clearly falls under the general rule.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is definitively \"yes\". The presence of \"highly lethal\" constitutes a direct match to the Q1 pattern. I'll need to stop here and issue the \"Alarmist\" frame, citing \"highly lethal\" as the decisive cue. This is a straightforward application of the claim framing protocol."}
