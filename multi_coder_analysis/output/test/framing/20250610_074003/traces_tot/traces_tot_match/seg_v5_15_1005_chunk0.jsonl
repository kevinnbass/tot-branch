{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The comparative adjective 'more' modifies the risk-adjective 'deadly'.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"Sometimes those strains [of avian influenza] can get into domestic flocks and mutate into more deadly viruses.\" My task is to evaluate this against the first question of the 12-step decision tree for claim framing, specifically looking for any indication of an \"Alarmist\" frame.\n\nQ1 focuses on whether there's an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. I'm given clear instructions: Look for patterns like \"so deadly,\" \"very dangerous,\" \"more deadly,\" or \"deadlier.\" These should be present with risk-adjectives like \"deadly,\" \"lethal,\" \"dangerous,\" etc.\n\nIn this segment, I immediately spot \"more deadly.\" \"More\" is a comparative adjective, and \"deadly\" is, without a doubt, a risk-adjective. Bingo! This matches the exact pattern I'm looking for: `Comparative + Risk-Adjective`.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is definitively \"yes\". The crucial cue here is, undeniably, \"more deadly\".  A \"yes\" at this stage, according to the precedence ladder and this Q1 rule, strongly suggests an \"Alarmist\" frame. I should then construct a JSON response accordingly."}
