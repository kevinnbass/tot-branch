{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'highly pathogenic strain' is treated as a technical term for the disease type, not an authorial intensifier modifying a general risk-adjective, per the technical-term guard rule.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment Against Q1 of the 12-Step Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, I've got it. The user wants me to apply Q1 of the decision tree to this text: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\" My task is to see if an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifies a risk adjective, following the Bedrock Principle and the Symmetry Rule meticulously.\n\nI'm looking for the pattern: `(intensifier/comparative) + (risk-adjective)`. The usual suspects are on my list: \"deadly,\" \"lethal,\" \"dangerous,\" etc., paired with intensifiers like \"very,\" \"highly,\" and so on.\n\nThe relevant phrase is \"highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza.\" I immediately recall the \"Technical-term guard,\" which explicitly states that \"highly pathogenic\" is **Neutral** when used as part of a formal disease name (like HPAI) unless other alarmist cues are present. My internal regex pattern even accounts for this with a negative lookahead to exclude instances of \"highly pathogenic avian influenza.\"\n\nIn this segment, \"highly pathogenic\" is clearly part of the description of the disease strain, not an authorial attempt to amplify a risk adjective. It’s a technical term, used within the formal context of describing the avian influenza strain, HPAI. Therefore, it *doesn't* meet the criteria for Q1.\n\nMy conclusion is \"no.\" This phrase doesn't trigger Q1. I now move on to Q2."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or the phrase 'on high alert' framing the event alarmingly. 'Highly pathogenic' describes the virus factually.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Evaluation: A Neutral Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to determine if it triggers Q2 of the decision tree. Q2 is about spotting those alarm bells: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative noun combos, or the phrase \"on high alert.\"  I've got to be on the lookout for any of those indicators.\n\nLet's break it down.  The segment starts with the outbreak \"came,\" then describes the government \"ordering,\" birds \"kept,\" tests \"confirmed,\" and swans \"found.\" Hmm. Those are all pretty standard verbs. Nothing like \"ravaged\" or \"decimated\" jumping out at me.  No potent metaphors either, no comparisons that really amp up the fear factor.  There are no superlative-negative noun pairings.\n\nThe phrase \"highly pathogenic strain\" pops up, but here's the key: it's a *technical* description of the virus itself. The Bedrock Principle is key here. It's not about amplifying the impact. It's a statement of fact.  \"Highly pathogenic\" is a descriptive adjective, not a framing verb or metaphor. Framing and Amplification are key.\n\nSo, according to the rules of Q2, and based on this segment, the answer is a clear \"no.\" No red flags here.  Time to move on to Q3."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified 'moderate verbs' paired with scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Alarmist Framing (Q3)**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. The task is to determine if the provided text segment triggers the \"Alarmist\" frame based on Question 3 (Q3) of the decision tree. Q3 specifically looks for \"moderate verbs\" paired with information suggesting \"significant scale or impact.\"\n\nFirst, I identified the text segment: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\"\n\nNext, I meticulously scanned for any \"moderate verbs\" from the pre-approved list. The text contains verbs like \"came,\" \"ordering,\" \"kept,\" \"confirmed,\" and \"found,\" but *none* of these match the criteria of the moderate verbs.\n\nI then checked for verbs related to culling/depopulation. The text discusses \"ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors,\" but makes no mention of culling or euthanasia.\n\nBased on this analysis, the rule's conditions are not met. Therefore, the answer to Q3 is definitively \"no.\" I'm confident in this assessment, and ready to move to the next question, but for this task, I'm just providing the JSON."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text segment contains no questions, rhetorical or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Loaded Rhetorical Questions (Q4)**\n\nOkay, so I need to assess this text snippet against the criteria defined in Q4 of our decision tree. That's the one focusing on loaded rhetorical questions that try to manufacture a sense of alarm. Let's see...\n\nMy initial read tells me this is a straightforward declarative statement. It's outlining the outbreak of something, then providing some context about actions taken by the government and recent test results. There's a clear cause-and-effect structure here, not some manipulative attempt to make me feel a specific way.\n\nI'm not seeing any questions, loaded or otherwise, within the text segment. It's just presenting information. Therefore, the answer to Q4 is definitively \"no\".\n\nHere's the JSON object reflecting my assessment:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The provided text segment is a declarative statement that describes an event and related actions. It does not contain any questions, including loaded rhetorical questions designed to imply alarm.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative event (outbreak) and a negative fact (highly pathogenic strain) but contains no explicit language from the author or a source designed to calm concerns or assure current safety.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and I'm being asked to apply Q5, which means I'm looking for those explicit calming cues – you know, phrases like \"no cause for alarm\" or \"fully under control.\" My job is to see if this passage provides reassurance about safety, control, or reduced risk.\n\nI read the text: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\"\n\nRight away, I see the narrative is negative. \"Outbreak\" implies a problem, and \"highly pathogenic strain\" is definitely not a good thing. I'm scanning for any soothing language, any attempt to downplay the situation, but...nothing. There's no attempt to calm fears. The bit about the government order is a preventative measure, but it doesn't indicate that things *are* currently safe or under control. It's more about trying to *prevent* further spread.\n\nSo, according to Q5, the answer is a clear \"no.\" The passage contains no explicit calming cues, no reassurances that the situation is safe, under control, or that the risk to the public is low. It simply reports the fact of an outbreak and the confirmation of a dangerous strain."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'two dead wild swans' but lacks both a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) and a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'among millions') required for this rule.", "thoughts": "**Q6 Evaluation: Minimiser + Scale Contrast for Reassurance**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The task is to determine if this text snippet fits the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern relevant to reassurance efforts under Q6.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the segment: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\"\n\nNow, I'll systematically apply the Q6 criteria. I'm looking for two things: a *minimiser* (words like \"only,\" \"just,\" etc., implying a small number or insignificant impact) and a *scale contrast* (phrases that put the event into a larger context, like \"out of millions\").\n\nChecking for a Minimiser: The text mentions \"two dead wild swans.\" I immediately scan for a minimiser before the number. It's not there. We just have \"two dead wild swans.\" It's critical to note that a bare number like \"two\" *isn't* a minimiser in this context; it needs one of those specific lexical cues.\n\nChecking for a Scale Contrast: I'm not seeing any phrases that put \"two dead wild swans\" into a larger population perspective. No \"out of thousands,\" no \"among millions of birds,\" no contrast to the overall bird population. The context is narrowly focused on the specific swans and the location where they were found.\n\nSince the rule demands *both* a minimiser *and* a scale contrast working together to effectively downplay the severity of the outbreak, and neither is present, I'm confident in my conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern isn't present in this text segment. The answer to Q6 is \"no.\" I'll now format the output as JSON."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any bare negation phrases like 'not expected', 'unlikely', 'no evidence', 'tests were negative', or similar.", "thoughts": "**Q7 Evaluation: Absence of Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, let me walk through this. The user wants me to assess a text segment against Question 7 of the decision tree. Q7 is all about identifying \"bare negations\" – statements that dismiss a risk or problem without any explicit reassurance. I need to be sharp here.\n\nAnalyzing the segment: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\"\n\nI'm looking for those key phrases that downplay something negative, that might sound like, \"It's nothing to worry about,\" even if they don't explicitly say it. I see no such explicit reassurance here. I'm focusing on \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no immediate concern,\" that sort of thing.\n\nLet's dissect it. \"The outbreak came despite...\" clearly establishes a contrasting scenario, that the situation is counter-intuitive. \"...ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors...\" is just a policy move. And \"tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain...\"? That's a confirmation of a real threat, not a negation.\n\nThere is no minimization or downplaying of the avian flu risk. No phrases like \"the situation is under control.\" No \"no cause for alarm.\" It's direct and factual. So, because there is no 'bare negation,' my answer to Q7 is a definitive \"no.\" Now, onto Q8!\n\n```json\n{\n  \"q7\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment does not contain any phrases that downplay or negate the risk of avian influenza without providing any explicit reassurance. It presents facts about an outbreak and preventive measures, but does not include any bare negations as defined in Q7.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Describes a preparedness measure ('ordering all birds... to be kept indoors') factually without explicit language linking it to current calm or safety.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Provided Text**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\" My task is to assess whether this aligns with Q8, which is focused on capability/preparedness statements *without* active reassurance.\n\nFirst, I need to pinpoint any language that suggests a capability or preparedness measure. Immediately, I see it: \"ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors.\" This is clearly a proactive step taken by the government to mitigate a potential risk – in this case, the spread of avian influenza.\n\nNow, the crucial test: does the segment offer active reassurance? Does it explicitly tell the reader \"don't worry,\" or \"the public is safe now,\" or imply that the measure effectively eliminated the risk? No, it doesn't. In fact, the phrase \"despite the government...ordering...to be kept indoors\" immediately undercuts any potential for reassurance. It sets up a contrast between a preparedness measure and the actual occurrence of an outbreak, indicating that the measure *wasn't* completely successful in preventing the issue.\n\nThis is a clear indicator that the text meets the Q8 criteria. It presents a capability/preparedness statement (\"ordering...to be kept indoors\") *without* any language that would be considered active reassurance. The lack of such language, and the direct contrast with the outbreak, solidifies this.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the segment does indeed fit Q8. I would encode this as:\n\n*   `answer`: \"yes\"\n*   `rationale`: \"Ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors is a preparedness measure. It is presented as a measure implemented, however, it is immediately contrasted by an outbreak and contains no reassurance that the measure eliminated or minimized the risk.\""}
