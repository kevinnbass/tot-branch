{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'highly' modifying the risk-adjective 'lethal'.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and need to check it against the first question (Q1) of the claim framing decision tree. Q1 is straightforward: does the segment contain an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective? My brain immediately scans for that specific pattern.\n\nThe segment is: \"A flock of about 240,000 chickens owned by Tyson Foods Inc. in Kentucky tested positive for a highly lethal form of bird flu...\".  I'm looking for *Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective*.\n\nAnd boom, there it is! \"highly lethal\".  \"Highly\" is on my list of intensifiers, and \"lethal\" is indeed a risk-adjective.  This *definitely* matches the `Intensifier + Risk-Adjective` pattern.\n\nThe rule even specifically calls out \"highly lethal\" as an example that triggers the \"Alarmist\" frame.  I quickly cross-reference that with the technical-term guard, which mentions \"highly pathogenic\" potentially being neutral *if* it's part of a formal HPAI name. But \"highly lethal\" isn't the formal name, and \"lethal\" is definitely on the risk-adjective list.\n\nTherefore, the answer is unequivocally \"yes\". The segment *does* contain a Q1 cue.  I'll quote the cue, \"highly lethal,\" in the rationale and flag the frame as \"Alarmist,\" as per the precedence rules.  The self-audit confirms I'm on track and I'm ready to output the pure JSON."}
