{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: A Clear 'No'**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" The task is to see if it fits the pattern we're looking for in Q1 of the 12-step tree. That pattern? An intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. Think \"so deadly,\" \"very dangerous,\" things like that.\n\nLet's break this down. First, we have \"Human infection is *rare*.\"  Now, *rare* is technically an adjective, but it's not the kind of risk-related adjective we're interested in.  We're looking for words like *deadly, dangerous, severe*, the usual suspects.  *Rare* implies low probability, not the severity or nature of the risk itself. Plus, it's not being amplified by an intensifier or comparative, no \"very rare\" or \"more rare\" here.\n\nThe rest of the sentence talks about *when* infection might happen, after contact. The verb \"occur\" doesn't contribute to risk assessment either. There's nothing in that clause that suggests any risk adjective or intensifier.\n\nSo, the conclusion is clear. We *don't* have an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk adjective in this segment.  Therefore, my response to Q1 is a firm \"no.\" The segment describes a low-frequency scenario and the conditions that might make it occur without amplifying or clarifying the risk."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('is rare', 'can occur') and does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 patterns.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment: A Q2 Perspective**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to evaluate: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" The instructions are clear - I need to run this through the Q2 filter. My brain immediately snaps to the Q2 decision criteria. I need to be on the lookout for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative noun phrases, or that alarmist \"on high alert\" phrasing.\n\nLet's see. Ramping up my internal radar... \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" \"skyrocketed\" - nope, nothing like that. No \"worst crisis,\" or \"most expensive disaster\" type phrasing either. And definitely no \"on high alert\" situation.  I'm also scanning for any metaphors designed to amplify fear - no \"ticking time bomb\" or \"nightmare scenario\" here.\n\nThe language is pretty straightforward. \"Is\" and \"can occur\" are the key verbs.  They are factual statements. The segment objectively explains that infection is rare, but possible under specific circumstances.  It's just stating a fact.\n\nSo, according to Q2, the answer is a resounding \"no.\" I'll need to proceed to the next stage in the decision tree, Q3, whenever I get it. The JSON output will reflect this analysis, of course."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Evaluation - My Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" My job is to see if it meets the criteria outlined in Question Q3 of the decision tree. I need to determine if it uses a \"moderate verb\" from the approved list, and if that verb is then explicitly connected to some significant scale or impact.\n\nFirst, I looked at the verbs. \"Is\" is a linking verb, and \"can occur\" is a modal and verb combination. Neither of these are on the \"moderate verb\" list – things like *hit*, *swept*, *surged*, and so on.\n\nThe segment also mentions \"rare\" and \"close contact,\" but these are descriptive terms, not verbs expressing any realized impact. There's no quantification of the impact; it simply states human infection is possible. There's no detail on how many humans, how many animals, no sense of scale. I see the potential for infection and the condition that facilitates the infection, but not an actual measurement of impact.\n\nGiven these observations, my conclusion is clear. The text doesn't contain the specific \"moderate verbs\" required by Q3. It's also not using any verbs in a way that provides explicit information on the scale or impact.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Question Q3 is a straightforward \"no.\" I'll move on to analyzing this against Q4, but for this specific output, I only need to supply the JSON response for Q3."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement, not a question. It does not contain a loaded rhetorical question.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text's Rhetorical Structure**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess this text snippet against the criteria in Q4 of our decision tree. Specifically, I need to determine if it uses any loaded rhetorical questions to induce a sense of alarm.\n\nLet's break it down. The segment I'm looking at reads: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"  Immediately, I see this is a declarative statement – it's presenting information, not posing a question.  It's simply stating a fact, albeit a slightly concerning one about the possibility of human infection from animals.\n\nThere are no question marks, no inverted word order, no phrasing that even hints at a question.  Therefore, after a quick but thorough examination, I can confidently answer \"no\" to the prompt regarding loaded rhetorical questions. My explanation for this will be straightforward: the provided text segment is a factual statement, not a question, and hence does not meet the criteria of Q4."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states infection is 'rare', which is a low-risk fact, but lacks explicit calming language or an intensified low-risk evaluation ('very low', 'extremely low') required for Reassuring.", "thoughts": "**Q5 Evaluation: No Calming Cues Detected**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze the text segment, \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal,\" against the Reassuring language criteria defined in Q5. I immediately think to myself, \"Alright, let's see if this snippet contains any of those explicit calming phrases or patterns we're looking for.\"\n\nMy initial thought is to break down the sentence. I see \"Human infection is rare\" and then \"but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" The first part, \"rare,\" is a low-probability statement, which is a positive fact. But I know from working with these rules that just stating a low-probability fact isn't enough to trigger \"Reassuring\" on its own. It's the framing and the *way* you say it that matters.\n\nI meticulously go through the Q5 checklist in my head. Does it say \"no cause for alarm\"? Nope. \"Public can rest easy\"? No. \"Fully under control\"? Absolutely not. \"Completely safe\"? Zilch.  Then I get to the phrase \"risk is *very* low.\"  \"Rare\" means low probability, but it's not intensified with a word like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or something similar.  I recall that the rules are specific: an intensifier is *required* for the low-risk evaluation to be considered reassuring.\n\nThere are no mentions of \"excellent news,\" \"very well protected,\" or safety preparations. It's just a straightforward statement.\n\nI'm thinking about the *Symmetry Rule* and how it applies here. A neutral statement of a low-risk probability doesn't automatically mean \"Reassuring.\" We need explicit framing, explicit language for calm, or an intensified low-risk evaluation.  The word \"rare\" is simply a descriptive term for low frequency. It doesn't have those qualifiers.\n\nTherefore, given my understanding of the Q5 criteria, I confidently conclude that the segment does not contain any explicit calming cues. My answer to Q5 has to be a firm \"no.\" And I need to be prepared to articulate the reasoning: no explicit calming language or intensified low-risk evaluation is present."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'rare' but lacks the specific lexical minimisers ('only', 'just', 'merely', 'a single', 'few') and an explicit scale contrast required for Q6.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" Pattern**\n\nOkay, so I need to assess this text snippet based on Q6, which is all about spotting that 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' pattern, you know, for reassurance purposes. The sentence is: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"\n\nLet's break this down systematically, as I always do. The core of Q6 is looking for very specific elements: a minimizer like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"a single,\" *plus* some sort of explicit scale contrast like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions.\"\n\nNow, \"Human infection is *rare*\"...  \"rare\" clearly indicates low frequency, but it's not one of those pre-defined minimizers that Q6 cares about. It's a description, not a direct negation or limitation. And the rest of the sentence describes a condition, not a scaling comparison.\n\nSo, I'm not seeing *any* of the minimizers Q6 is looking for in that list (\"only,\" \"just,\" etc.).  And there's absolutely no explicit scale contrast to be found. \"Rare\" simply means uncommon; it doesn't give us the precise comparison Q6 is looking for.\n\nTherefore, this segment doesn't fit the 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' pattern. I'll have to answer \"no\" to Q6. My rationale will have to be crystal clear about the absence of the specific lexical features Q6 demands."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states 'Human infection is rare' and 'can occur', neither of which are 'bare negations' as defined by Q7 (e.g., 'not expected', 'unlikely', 'no cases', 'do not present').", "thoughts": "**Analysis of the Text Segment in Relation to Q7 of the Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with assessing this segment: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal\" against Q7, which deals with \"bare negations\" without any explicit calming cues.\n\nLet's dissect this. \"Human infection is rare\" immediately strikes me as a probabilistic statement, essentially describing the frequency of infection. It *isn't* a direct negation like \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" or \"no cases.\" Those terms explicitly *deny* or *downplay* something, which is the core of Q7's concern. This is simply stating a *low* frequency. The second part, \"but can occur,\" acknowledges a possibility; again, not a negation.\n\nThe key to Q7, as I see it, is identifying those specific types of negations – negations of expectation, evidence, risk, or capability – that are presented without any mitigation. Looking at the examples provided in the pattern recognition table (like \"not expected to cause problems,\" \"unlikely to affect consumers,\" and so on), this segment just doesn't align.\n\n\"Human infection is rare\" isn't negating anything; it's simply a statement about the current state. It's about likelihood, not an explicit denial or statement of impossibility. My expert intuition is telling me that this doesn't fit the pattern of \"bare negations\" that Q7 is looking for. This is a straightforward statement of a low probability.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the segment does *not* contain a \"bare negation\" as defined by Q7. My output will reflect \"no\" as the answer, along with a rationale explaining that the statement is about frequency/likelihood, not a negation. Given the \"no\" answer, the logic dictates I should proceed to Q8."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the nature and likelihood of infection, not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Q8 Analysis - A Straightforward \"No\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this segment, \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal,\" and the task is to evaluate it against Q8. Q8 is looking for descriptions of capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, *without* those things being explicitly linked to current calm, safety, or minimal risk.\n\nHmm... this segment. It simply lays out a *fact*. A negative one, sure - potential infection. But also, a mitigating factor: it's rare, and it requires close contact. This isn't about *what we can do*, *how we're preparing*, *what we hope for*, or *how we've protected ourselves*. It's just a description of the risk profile.\n\nI reviewed my mental notes about the pattern recognition, and Q8 is very specific about *response*, *development*, *preparedness*, or *future possibilities*. This isn't about actions. It's about a mechanism and likelihood. Nothing here suggests a planned or projected state.\n\nTherefore, Q8: **no**.  That's my answer. Now I'll move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses human infection risk, not prices, economic data, or numerical metrics.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to assess this segment against Q9 of the decision tree. Q9, as I recall, is looking for factual reporting of prices or metrics, using specific language markers, and crucially, *avoiding* vivid verbs, risk adjectives, and explicit framing. Let me re-read the segment: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"\n\nAlright, this is about the risk of human infection from animals. It's not about prices, economic indicators, or any numerical data related to economic activity. That's a clear miss right there. The focus is on a biological risk, not an economic one. It doesn't discuss market fluctuations, inflation, GDP growth, or any other financial metric that Q9 would be concerned with.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q9 has to be a firm \"no\". The content simply doesn't align with the criteria of factual reporting related to prices or metrics. My rationale is straightforward: the segment's subject matter falls outside the scope of what Q9 is designed to evaluate."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the current state of risk ('rare but can occur') and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment: Question Q10**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" The task is to determine if this aligns with Question Q10 of the decision tree. Q10 is looking for any speculation about *future* relief or improvement, but without explicitly calming the current state.\n\nReading the segment, it seems pretty clear. It's essentially stating a current state of affairs: infection is rare, but possible. There's no hint of \"things will get better,\" \"it's improving,\" or anything along those lines. The focus is on the present, describing a risk scenario, not forecasting a shift or improvement.\n\nSo, according to Q10's criteria, this segment *doesn't* speculate about future relief. My answer is unequivocally \"no.\" This one's straightforward, really. We'd have to move on to the next question (Q11), but that's not what's required here."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any directly quoted source.", "thoughts": "**Q11 Evaluation: No Quoted Source Detected**\n\nOkay, so I need to assess this text segment, \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal,\" against Q11 of my decision tree. That means I'm looking for a directly quoted source that's framing the information as either alarmist or reassuring.\n\nFirst step: scan the text for quotes. Hmm, no quotation marks, no attribution, nothing like \"according to Dr. Jones...\" Nope, nothing directly quoted here.\n\nTherefore, because there's no direct quote, I *cannot* answer \"yes\" to Q11. It's a clear \"no\" based on the established rule: Q11 requires a directly quoted source. So, I'll need to indicate a \"no\" response for Q11 in the JSON output, along with a rationale explaining that the lack of a directly quoted source necessitates a negative response. Then, I'll proceed to the next node in the tree (Q12), even though I'm not explicitly prompted for it at this point, it's the logical next step."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit framing cues; facts presented factually. 'rare' describes frequency, not amplified impact.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Segment: Neutral Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the final check, Q12. The task is to see if any alarmist or reassuring cues were missed by the previous steps. Let's break down this segment: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look for any explicit Alarmist flags. \"Rare\" *might* seem like it could be framing, but it's really just stating a fact about the frequency of infection. It's not amplifying the negative impact. The phrase \"can occur\" indicates possibility, and that's not a vivid verb highlighting a negative effect. \"Close contact\" and \"infected animal\" are also purely descriptive. No intensifiers, no exaggerations, and definitely no loaded metaphors. Nothing to signal alarm bells.\n\nNext, I scan for Reassuring cues. \"Rare\" could *imply* reassurance, but it's not the same as using explicit calming language like \"don't worry\" or \"it's safe.\" The segment doesn't explicitly frame things for calm or safety.\n\nFinally, I have to determine if the facts are presented objectively. \"Human infection is rare\" and \"can occur after close contact...\" are factual statements describing the low likelihood of infection and the conditions for it to happen. The language is descriptive and avoids any overt bias.\n\nTherefore, since I've found no explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues and the information is presented factually, this segment defaults to a Neutral frame. Q12: **Yes**. And the rationale is that there are no framing cues; the facts are simply stated."}
