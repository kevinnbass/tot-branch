{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains the risk-adjective 'deadly' but it is not modified by an intensifier or comparative as required by Q1.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of Q1**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text segment: \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\" My task is to analyze this against Q1 of the decision tree. I understand the game; I'm looking for an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nFirst, I quickly scan the segment. I identify \"deadly\" as the potential risk-adjective. Now, the crucial step: is \"deadly\" being *modified* by an intensifier (like \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.) or a comparative (like \"more\", \"less\", etc.)? I immediately see that it's not. \"Deadly\" stands alone here, used as a basic risk assessment. The wording isn't modified.\n\nTherefore, the condition of Q1 is *not* met. The presence of the risk-adjective is acknowledged, but it's the *modification* that Q1 cares about. Because I don't see that modification, my answer to Q1 is definitely \"no\". I have to articulate *why* it's a \"no\", and the reason is straightforward: while the text contains the risk-adjective \"deadly,\" it is *not* modified by an intensifier or comparative as defined in the Q1 rules. I can move on to the JSON format."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a potential outcome ('can be deadly') but does not use any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or the 'on high alert' phrase listed in the Q2 patterns.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Evaluation: Avian Flu Example**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to scrutinize this snippet about avian flu against the criteria for Question 2 of the decision tree. Q2 is all about spotting alarmist language: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or that \"on high alert\" phrase. I know what I'm looking for.\n\nI've got the text: \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\" My focus is on the second part. The key word that jumps out is \"deadly.\" But does \"deadly\" fit the bill for Q2?\n\nI run through my mental checklist. \"Deadly\" is an adjective, not a verb. It's not one of those high-impact verbs like \"ravaged\" or \"skyrocketed.\" It doesn't appear in any superlative + negative noun combination, and it's certainly not part of a metaphor or the \"on high alert\" phrase.\n\nThe text *does* state a negative fact - that avian flu *can* be deadly. However, it does so factually. It describes a potential characteristic, not a vividly amplified or alarmist scenario. The Bedrock Principle and Symmetry Rule tell me a neutral statement of a negative fact is just that: neutral.\n\nQ2 is specifically looking for that extra push, that vivid framing that over-emphasizes or dramatizes a situation. While the information is negative, it's not presented with the kind of high-impact language that would trigger Q2. Therefore, my answer is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'can be deadly' which is a statement of potential impact, not a moderate verb from the specified list paired with scale/impact.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for the Alarmist Frame**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text snippet and evaluating it against that Q3 rule.  Basically, I need to see if it's using \"moderate verbs\" alongside information about significant scale or impact.  I've got the list of those specific verbs in mind: things like *swept*, *surged*, *prompted*, etc.  And then I need to look for that connection to \"millions\" or \"record losses\" or some similar indicator of a big deal.\n\nThe text reads, \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\"  I'm scanning for those moderate verbs.  Right away, I see \"does not cause.\" But \"does not cause\" is a *negation* not one of our moderate verbs. Then I see \"can be deadly.\" That's a statement about a potential outcome, not an action describing a significant event. And the verb \"be\" (as in \"can be\") isn't on the list of verbs we're looking for.  \"Deadly\" is an *adjective* here, not a verb.\n\nSo, according to my expert understanding, there are no matches.  Q3 isn't satisfied.  The answer is \"no,\" because the necessary verb pattern isn't present in this text."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no questions, rhetorical or otherwise. It is a declarative statement.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Text Segment Against Q4**\n\nOkay, I need to analyze this text snippet against Q4 of our decision tree. Specifically, I'm checking for any loaded rhetorical questions meant to induce a sense of alarm. The text is: \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\"\n\nImmediately, I see this isn't a question at all. It's a straight-up declarative statement presenting two facts: first, that avian flu is generally asymptomatic in wild birds, which is neutral, and second, that it can be deadly in domestic poultry. This latter fact is negative, but it's presented in a neutral, informative tone.\n\nThere are no questions here, loaded or otherwise. Therefore, the answer to Q4 is clearly \"no.\" I'll construct the JSON response now, making sure the rationale explicitly states the absence of any question within the text as the key reason for the \"no\" answer."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports facts about avian flu's effects on wild birds and poultry but lacks explicit calming language or intensified low-risk evaluation for humans or the public.", "thoughts": "**Q5 Evaluation: No Explicit Calming Cue Detected**\n\nOkay, so I need to assess this text segment, specifically against Question Q5 of the decision tree. Q5 is looking for an *explicit* calming cue, a direct attempt to reassure the reader. Let's see... the text says, \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\"\n\nRight away, I can identify two key pieces of information. The first is a potentially positive statement about wild birds – no symptoms *usually*. The second is a definitely negative statement about domestic poultry – it *can be deadly*.\n\nNow, the crucial aspect for Q5 is whether we have that direct, reassuring language. Do we see something like \"no need to worry,\" \"the situation is under control,\" or \"risk is minimal\"?  No, I don't see any of that. The first statement about wild birds *could* be reassuring, but it's not explicitly framed that way. It simply states a fact. It doesn't use any intensifying low-risk language to amplify the positive.  The second part is actually a warning, highlighting the danger to poultry.\n\nTherefore, because there's no explicit attempt to reassure, no use of the kind of calming language Q5 is looking for, I have to conclude that the answer to Q5 is \"no.\"  The text doesn't contain an explicit calming cue."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes typical outcomes in wild birds and potential outcomes in domestic poultry but does not use a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) combined with a scale contrast ('out of X', 'among Y') for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment for Reassurance Techniques**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment and need to determine if it uses the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" reassurance technique, specifically looking at Q6 of the decision tree. My task is clear: to see if the segment contains a minimiser word paired with a contrasting scale, all for the purpose of reassurance.\n\nFirst, I break down the segment. The initial part, about avian flu not usually causing symptoms in wild birds, is simply a factual statement. There's no minimiser like \"only\" or \"just\" here, and no contrasting scale. It's just a general observation.\n\nNext, I look at the part about the flu being deadly in domestic poultry. Again, I see no minimiser in phrases like \"can be deadly\". It highlights the severity in a specific context. But I don't see any explicit or implied contrast, like \"among X amount of birds\", to minimise the severity.\n\nSince I don't see the presence of the necessary criteria, the answer is a clear \"no.\" The segment lacks the essential combination of a minimiser word and a contrasting scale that would indicate reassurance is being provided. It's a straightforward analysis, really, based on those key elements of the decision tree."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'does not cause any symptoms' is a bare negation without an explicit calming cue.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Decision Tree Q7**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment: \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\" My task is to evaluate it against Q7 of the decision tree. Q7 specifically asks if there's a \"bare negation\" without an explicit calming cue.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. The segment clearly includes a negation: \"does not cause any symptoms.\" I immediately start running through the mental checklist I've developed over years of analyzing these cases. Does \"does not cause any symptoms\" fit the definition of a \"bare negation\"? Let's see... it aligns with the patterns I'm familiar with, like \"not expected to cause problems,\" \"unlikely to affect X,\" and \"viruses do not transmit easily.\" The phrase *definitely* states what the flu *doesn't* do in a specific context (wild birds), which makes it a form of 'Capability Negation' or perhaps 'Expectation Negation' depending on the interpretation of \"usually.\"\n\nNow, the crucial next step: is there an explicit calming cue *accompanying* this negation? I scan the segment. Nope. No \"so there's no need for public concern,\" no \"meaning consumers can be confident,\" nothing like that. Instead, we have \"but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry,\" which, while acknowledging a potential danger, isn't a calming cue in any way.\n\nTherefore, according to my expert judgment and my understanding of the decision tree, the answer to Q7 is *yes*. The segment does contain a bare negation (\"does not cause any symptoms\") without an explicit calming cue. I would provide \"yes\" as my answer, along with the quoted bare negation to justify my evaluation."}
