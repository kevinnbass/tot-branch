{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'highly' modifying the risk-adjective 'lethal'.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"They [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\" My task is to apply the first question (Q1) of the 12-step decision tree.\n\nThe core of Q1 is to determine if the text contains an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective. I immediately zero in on the phrase \"highly lethal bird flu.\" Analyzing it, \"highly\" clearly functions as an intensifier, and \"lethal\" is indeed a risk-adjective (it's specifically called out in the Q1 rules). Critically, \"highly\" directly modifies \"lethal.\" Bingo! This structure, Intensifier + Risk-Adj, is a direct hit for triggering an \"Alarmist\" frame, according to the Q1 criteria. The rules are clear: \"highly lethal\" is a slam-dunk example that triggers the Alarmist frame, unlike \"highly pathogenic\" when part of a formal name. This is *not* a formal name.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q1 is definitively \"yes.\" My decisive cue is the phrase \"highly lethal.\" Since I answered \"yes,\" I'm done. I don't need to consider any lower-numbered steps. My output will be pure JSON."}
