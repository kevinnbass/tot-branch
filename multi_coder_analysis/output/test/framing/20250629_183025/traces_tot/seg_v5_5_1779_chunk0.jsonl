{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "Segment contains no intensifier + risk-adjective, comparative + risk-adjective, or lethal-from-outset idiom.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "However, the latest cases in Colorado were among poultry workers.", "article_id": 1779, "thoughts": "**My Assessment of Alarmist Cue Q1**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to analyze this segment, \"However, the latest cases in Colorado were among poultry workers,\" through the lens of Q1, which focuses on identifying alarmist cues. Specifically, it's looking for the presence of an Intensifier coupled with a Risk-Adjusting term, or a fixed \"Lethal-from-Outset\" idiom.\n\nI've carefully examined the text.  There's no sign of the typical intensifiers I'd be looking for: words like \"so,\" \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"highly,\" \"frighteningly,\" \"more,\" or \"deadlier.\"  And I certainly don't see any of the risk-adjusting adjectives like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" \"catastrophic,\" \"lethal,\" \"contagious,\" \"virulent,\" or \"destructive\" that would trigger my alarm bells.  The segment just states a location (\"among poultry workers\").  No inherent \"lethal-from-outset\" idiom is present.\n\nTherefore, after a thorough review, my conclusion is clear:  Q1 does not identify an alarmist cue in this instance. The answer is a definitive \"no\".\n"}
