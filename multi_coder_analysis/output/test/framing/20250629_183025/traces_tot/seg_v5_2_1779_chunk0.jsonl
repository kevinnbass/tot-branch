{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "'Highly pathogenic' is a technical term for the disease name, not an intensifier modifying a general risk adjective.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) is an infectious viral illness that spreads primarily among wild and domestic birds.", "article_id": 1779, "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Q1**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment: \"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) is an infectious viral illness that spreads primarily among wild and domestic birds.\"  The task is to see if it triggers any of the alarmist patterns in Q1.  I need to check for intensifiers, comparatives, and the fixed lethal idiom.\n\nRight away, I see \"Highly pathogenic avian influenza\".  But, according to the rule, \"highly pathogenic\" is part of the formal disease name, HPAI.  So, I can't consider that an intensifier *unless* there are other alarmist cues.  It's just a technical term here.\n\nNext, I see \"infectious viral illness.\" \"Infectious\" is a risk adjective, no doubt. But it's not intensified or compared to anything else. No \"very infectious,\" \"more infectious,\" or anything like that.\n\nSo, I've checked all the boxes. None of the patterns in Q1 are present.  My answer for Q1 is \"no.\"  Simple enough.\n"}
