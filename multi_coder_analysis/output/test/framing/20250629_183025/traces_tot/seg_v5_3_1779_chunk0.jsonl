{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "Segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "But the virus that causes bird flu can sometimes jump into animals, including dairy cows and, in some cases, humans.", "article_id": 1779, "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Provided Segment**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The task is to evaluate this segment, \"But the virus that causes bird flu can sometimes jump into animals, including dairy cows and, in some cases, humans,\" using a 12-step decision tree, starting with the first question (Q1). My role here is as an expert claim-framing coder, essentially identifying specific linguistic cues that indicate how risk is being portrayed.\n\nQ1 focuses on intensified or comparative risk language. I need to see if the segment uses words like \"very dangerous,\" \"more contagious,\" or phrases like \"deadly from the start.\" The given patterns are: intensifier + risk-adjective, comparative + risk-adjective, or a fixed lethal-from-outset idiom.\n\nLooking at the text, I see none of those. It describes the virus jumping species barriers, which is an important point, of course, but the focus is on the *potential* for transmission, not on emphasizing the severity of the risk itself. There are no qualifiers like \"extremely\" or \"more,\" nor any direct risk adjectives.\n\nSince none of the Q1 patterns are present, the answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" My next step is to move on to the next question in the decision tree (Q2).\n"}
