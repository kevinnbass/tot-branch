My goal, as a claim-framing expert, is to identify potential framing cues, starting with Q1.\n\nThe segment states: \"In the latest string of cases, all those infected were working at a poultry farm in northeast Colorado and had direct contact with the infected birds.\"  Let's see, Q1 is about intensifiers and comparatives combined with risk adjectives. The prompt specifically outlines three patterns: an intensifier plus risk adjective (\"so deadly\"), a comparative plus risk adjective (\"more dangerous\"), and fixed idioms that imply inherent risk (\"deadly from the start\").\n\nScanning the text, I see words like \"infected\" and \"cases,\" but they're purely descriptive, factual statements about the presence of infection. I don't see any words that modify a risk adjective, like \"very\" or \"more.\" And there are no phrases that are fixed idioms about immediate danger. It's a straightforward description of a situation.\n\nSo, according to my expertise, Q1 is a clear \"no.\" No framing cues detected. I'll move on to Q2.\n"}
