{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The phrase 'highly pathogenic' is a technical term for H5N1 and does not trigger Q1.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "Romania has reported a new outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, on a farm in the south of the country, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Monday.", "article_id": 1041, "thoughts": "**Initial Assessment of the Provided Segment**\n\nOkay, I've been given a segment regarding an avian influenza outbreak in Romania: \"Romania has reported a new outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, on a farm in the south of the country, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Monday.\" My task is to act as an expert claim-framing coder and evaluate this using a 12-step decision tree, starting with Q1.\n\nQ1 requires me to identify specific patterns that indicate potential risk amplification. I'm looking for:\n*   `Q1.1`: Intensifiers paired with risk-related adjectives.\n*   `Q1.2`: Comparative risk adjectives.\n*   `Q1.3`: Fixed lethal-from-outset idioms.\n\nThe crucial part here is the phrase \"highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza.\" However, my understanding of the protocol dictates that this phrase, and the abbreviation \"HPAI,\" are considered *technical terms*. These are neutral taxonomy, not indicators of risk amplification within the framework of Q1. The Technical Term Guard specifically tells me to skip it.\n\nI've scanned the rest of the sentence. No other intensifiers, comparative adjectives, or fixed lethal-from-outset idioms are present.  Therefore, after a careful evaluation based on my expertise, the answer to Q1 is \"no.\" This segment does not exhibit the characteristics that Q1 is designed to capture.\n"}
