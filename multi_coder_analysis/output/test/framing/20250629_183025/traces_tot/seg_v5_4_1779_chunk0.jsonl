{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "Segment contains no intensifier + risk-adjective, comparative + risk-adjective, or lethal-from-outset idiom.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "A \"multi-state outbreak\" of the virus has emerged among dairy cattle since mid-March, according to the CDC, and four human cases have been confirmed following exposure to dairy cows.", "article_id": 1779, "thoughts": "**Initial Assessment of Risk Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a sentence: \"A \"multi-state outbreak\" of the virus has emerged among dairy cattle since mid-March, according to the CDC, and four human cases have been confirmed following exposure to dairy cows.\" My task is to act as a claim-framing coder, and I need to assess this segment using a 12-step decision tree. I'll start with Q1.\n\nQ1 asks if there's any use of intensifiers, comparatives, or lethal-from-outset idioms. Let's break it down: \"multi-state outbreak\" isn't an intensifier; it describes the scope, not the severity of the outbreak. \"Virus,\" \"emerged,\" \"dairy cattle,\" \"four human cases,\" \"confirmed,\" \"exposure,\" and \"dairy cows\" are all factual, neutral terms. There's no use of language that amplifies risk or paints the situation in an overly alarmist light. No \"deadly\" threats, no vivid comparatives, and no immediate doom-and-gloom language.\n\nTherefore, Q1 doesn't apply. I'll answer \"no\" and proceed to the next step in the decision tree (Q2).\n"}
