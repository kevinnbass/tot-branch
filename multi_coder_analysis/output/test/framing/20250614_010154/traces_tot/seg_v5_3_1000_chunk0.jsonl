{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses factual/technical terms ('reported', 'ordered', 'euthanized', 'testing positive') and the technical term 'highly pathogenic' (ignored). The number ('nearly 30,000') describes scale, but the verbs do not meet the Q2 criteria.

{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'reported' is not in the Q3 regex list. 'ordered...to be euthanized' is a future/plan action, not realised impact.", "method": "llm_batch"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a loaded rhetorical question.", "method": "llm_batch"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports outbreaks and culling but lacks explicit calming language.", "method": "llm_batch"}
