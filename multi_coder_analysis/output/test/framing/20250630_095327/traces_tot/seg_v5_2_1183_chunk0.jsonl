{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment describes the location of a case but contains no intensifiers or risk-adjectives.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "The Nebraska Department of Agriculture said the case was found on an egg-laying farm in Dixon County, according to the Associated Press.", "article_id": 1183, "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to apply my expertise in claim-framing coding to this text segment: \"The Nebraska Department of Agriculture said the case was found on an egg-laying farm in Dixon County, according to the Associated Press.\"  My task is to determine whether this aligns with Question Q1 of that 12-step decision tree.\n\nFirst, I read the segment carefully. Then, I automatically scanned for those key elements: intensifiers and comparative adjectives. I'm looking for things like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"more,\" or \"deadlier,\" and I'm looking for risk-adjectives: \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" etc. I know the nuances of these words, and I'm specifically looking for cases where an intensifier is directly modifying one of those risk-adjectives *within the same clause*.\n\nIn this segment, I see mention of a \"case\" being found. That's relevant, of course, but the phrasing is purely factual. There's no attempt to quantify the risk or describe its severity, at least not in this segment.  There are no intensifiers or comparatives modifying any adjectives, risk-related or otherwise.  It's just a statement of fact and location.  Therefore, I conclude that the answer to Q1 is \"no.\" I'm confident in this assessment.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('said', 'was found') and contains no high-potency verbs, metaphors, or other Q2 cues.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "The Nebraska Department of Agriculture said the case was found on an egg-laying farm in Dixon County, according to the Associated Press.", "article_id": 1183, "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against Q2**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and need to determine if it triggers any of the patterns outlined in Q2 of the decision tree.  My understanding is that Q2 is looking for specific linguistic indicators of heightened concern or potential significance. It's asking if the language is particularly *strong* or if it's hinting at something beyond a basic statement of fact.\n\nLet's break it down: \"The Nebraska Department of Agriculture said the case was found on an egg-laying farm in Dixon County, according to the Associated Press.\"  First, I'm checking for high-potency verbs.  \"Said\" and \"was found\" are clearly not those.  They're neutral reporting verbs, perfectly standard for this kind of information.  Next, I'm scanning for any superlative + negative noun pairings.  There's nothing like \"the worst outbreak\" or \"the most devastating finding.\"  The text doesn't contain any critical alert phrases either; no mentions of being \"on high alert.\"  Finally, I'm on the lookout for potent metaphors, things like \"a ticking time bomb\" or \"a nightmare scenario,\" but nothing there either.\n\nThe text reads as a straightforward reporting of where something was found, and the source. The language is intentionally neutral.  Therefore, after this evaluation, I'm confident in saying the answer to Q2 is no. There are no high-potency verbs, metaphors, or other Q2 cues that would lead me to believe this warrants a 'yes' response.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment contains no moderate verbs from the specified list (e.g., hit, swept, soared) paired with scale or impact information.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "The Nebraska Department of Agriculture said the case was found on an egg-laying farm in Dixon County, according to the Associated Press.", "article_id": 1183, "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Decision Tree Q3 - Negative Result**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this text segment: \"The Nebraska Department of Agriculture said the case was found on an egg-laying farm in Dixon County, according to the Associated Press.\" My task is to evaluate it against Q3 of the decision tree. That means I need to check for a 'moderate verb' paired with explicit 'scale or impact' information.\n\nFirst, I looked at the verbs. \"Said\" and \"was found\" are present, but neither of them match any of the moderate verbs I'm considering: HIT, SWEPT, SOARED, SURGED, PLUMMETED, PROMPTED, SPIKED, PEAKED, JUMPED, or SHOT UP.\n\nThen I checked for any 'scale or impact' information. \"Egg-laying farm\" and \"Dixon County\" are present, but these are location details, not quantitative information about the scope or consequences of the case. So, even if I had a suitable moderate verb, the 'scale or impact' component is missing.\n\nGiven that neither condition is satisfied – no moderate verb from the list, and no explicit scale/impact information paired with those verbs – my conclusion is that Q3 is answered \"no\".\n"}
