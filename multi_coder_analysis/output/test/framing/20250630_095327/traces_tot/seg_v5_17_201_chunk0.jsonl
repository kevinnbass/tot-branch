The user wants me to apply Q1 of the decision tree to this text snippet: \"In previous years cases dropped in the summer, but this year outbreaks continued with experts suspecting highly pathogenic variants of avian flu are now endemic in wild birds, creating a risk of infection all year.\"\n\nMy task is to see if there's an intensifier or comparative adjective *directly* modifying a risk-adjective. I'm focusing on that. I spot the phrase \"highly pathogenic\". Now, I remember the `TECH_TERM_GUARD` rule and Q1's specific criteria. **\"Highly pathogenic\" here is part of a technical term, specifically referring to a classification of avian flu variants.** It's like saying \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\" – it's a defined term. This isn't the same as an intensifier like \"very\" or \"extremely\" in front of \"risky\".\n\nTherefore, according to the rules, \"highly pathogenic\" doesn't count as an intensifier in this context. It's a technical term functioning as part of the disease description.  So, in this sentence, there isn't an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective in the way Q1 is looking for. **The answer to Q1 is \"no.\"**\n"}

{"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment uses 'dropped' and 'continued' but these are not on the list of moderate verbs for Q3, nor is specific scale/impact information provided.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "In previous years cases dropped in the summer, but this year outbreaks continued with experts suspecting highly pathogenic variants of avian flu are now endemic in wild birds, creating a risk of infection all year.", "article_id": 201, "thoughts": "**Q3 Decision Point Evaluation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment and need to assess if it triggers Q3 of the decision tree. Q3, as I recall, is looking for a \"moderate verb\" accompanied by explicit scale or impact information. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I identified the text: \"In previous years cases dropped in the summer, but this year outbreaks continued with experts suspecting highly pathogenic variants of avian flu are now endemic in wild birds, creating a risk of infection all year.\"\n\nNow, the crucial step: hunting for those moderate verbs. I have that list in mind: HIT, SWEPT, SOARED, SURGED, PLUMMETED, PROMPTED, SPIKED, PEAKED, JUMPED, SHOT UP, HARD HIT. \"Dropped\" is present, \"continued\" is present, \"suspecting\" and \"creating\" are present. None of those match the moderate verb list.\n\nNext, I scan for the scale/impact piece. I see \"cases dropped,\" \"outbreaks continued,\" \"endemic,\" and \"risk of infection all year.\" \"Cases dropped\" suggests a change, but it lacks specific scale – no percentages, numbers, anything quantitative. \"Outbreaks continued\" just tells us about duration. \"Endemic\" is a state, not a measurement of impact. And the risk description relates to duration too.\n\nEven if I had a moderate verb, would it be paired with explicit scale/impact? Nope. And no containment or financial metrics are relevant here. As for realised impact, sure, past events are described. But the verbs are not on my moderate verb list, and the necessary scale data is missing.\n\nTherefore, since the text doesn't meet the criteria, the answer is \"no\".\n"}
