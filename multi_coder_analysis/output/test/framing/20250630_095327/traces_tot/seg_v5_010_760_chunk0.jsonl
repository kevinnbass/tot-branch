Q1 is all about spotting intensifiers or comparative adjectives modifying risk adjectives. It's a key first step.\n\nLet's break it down. I'm looking for the usual suspects: words like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"more,\" or any comparative forms. I'm also scanning for any obvious risk adjectives – the usual suspects related to danger or severity, like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" or \"catastrophic.\" \n\nThe phrase \"This is another year that I can't show\" doesn't have any of those things. It's expressing a personal consequence or experience (\"can't show\"). It's *not* describing anything in terms of risk intensification or comparison, as defined by Q1. \n\nSo, based on that, the answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" It just doesn't meet the criteria. This is straightforward.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment is a simple statement of consequence ('can't show') and does not contain any high-potency verbs or potent metaphors as defined in Q2.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "This is another year that I can't show.”", "article_id": 760, "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Language for Impact**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this phrase, \"This is another year that I can't show.\" My task is to see if it meets the criteria of Q2 in this decision tree. Q2 is looking for high-potency verbs or potent metaphors.  Right off the bat, I can tell this is pretty straightforward. It's a direct quote, essentially a statement of fact or a consequence.\n\nThere aren't any bells and whistles in terms of powerful language here. I'm not seeing any verbs that would qualify as \"high-potency\" – nothing like \"decimated,\" \"soared,\" or \"crippled.\"  And certainly no metaphorical language, no \"ticking time-bombs\" or \"nightmare scenarios.\"  The language is simple and factual, focusing on this person's inability to \"show\" something. It's a direct expression of a limitation, not a dramatic or vividly framed statement.\n\nGiven this, the answer to Q2 is unequivocally \"no.\"\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment contains no moderate verbs from the list and no explicit scale or impact information.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "This is another year that I can't show.”", "article_id": 760, "thoughts": "**Assessing the Segment \"This is another year that I can't show\" Against Decision Tree Q3**\n\nOkay, so the task at hand is to analyze this phrase: \"This is another year that I can't show.\" I need to apply Q3 of the decision tree to this segment.  My first instinct is to immediately look for those moderate verbs, and then to consider if this phrase implies any significant scale or impact.\n\nRight, so step one, I've identified the segment.  Easy enough. Now, for the verbs.  \"Is\" and \"can't show\" are the key ones here.  Neither of those land on my list of moderate verbs. We know that list, HIT, SWEPT, SOARED, SURGED, PLUMMETED, PROMPTED, SPIKED, PEAKED, JUMPED, SHOT UP, HARD HIT. None of them are present.\n\nOkay, so no moderate verbs. What about the scale or impact? \"Another year\" suggests repetition or a trend, and \"can't show\" implies a personal impact, like being unable to exhibit at the livestock fair again.  But it's not quantitative. There's no percentage, no number of animals, no financial loss.  No real scale. It's more of a qualitative statement.\n\nSo, since there are no moderate verbs from the list, the whole pairing condition is automatically off the table.  This whole thing fails.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q3 is definitely \"no.\" I'm going to create the JSON object, with the `answer` set to \"no,\" and I will include a detailed `rationale` that explains exactly why the specific criteria weren't met (no moderate verbs and no explicit scale/impact information).\n"}
