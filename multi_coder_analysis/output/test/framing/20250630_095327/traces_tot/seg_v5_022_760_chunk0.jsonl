{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective.

This Q1 looks for any intensifiers or comparatives that are *directly* modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nMy immediate thought process goes like this: first, I need to scan the text for any potential intensifiers or comparatives. I see \"So\" right away. Okay, good. Next, I need to check for those risk-adjectives the tree is looking for: words like \"deadly,\" \"severe,\" \"dangerous,\" you know, the usual suspects. But... none of those are present.\n\nSo, I analyze the function of \"So\" in this context. It's clearly being used as a conjunction, essentially saying \"therefore\" or \"thus.\" It's not functioning as an intensifier, which would be like saying \"very\" or \"extremely.\" Even if it were an intensifier, there's nothing for it to modify! No risk-adjective to be intensified.\n\nTherefore, Q1's requirements aren't met. The answer is \"no.\"  I'm ready to move on.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment expresses uncertainty but does not contain any high-potency verbs or potent metaphors listed in the Q2 criteria.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "“So, just like COVID, I don't know what next year's going to hold.”", "article_id": 760, "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Q2**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment: \"So, just like COVID, I don't know what next year's going to hold.\" and my task is to check if it fits the Q2 pattern of the decision tree. Q2 is all about those high-impact verbs and metaphors that really paint a bleak picture.\n\nI break it down: \"just like COVID\" is a comparison, sure, it establishes a parallel with a significant event, but it's not a *vivid* image itself. It's more of a general link. Then we have \"I don't know what next year's going to hold.\" That's classic uncertainty, not a descriptor.\n\nHonestly, there's just no \"ravaged,\" \"skyrocketed,\" \"nightmare,\" or anything like that in here. It's a statement of uncertainty, cleverly linked to COVID, but lacking the inflammatory language Q2 is looking for. So, the answer is a definitive \"no.\" I'll need to explain why, citing the absence of the required high-potency verbs and potent metaphors.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment contains no moderate verbs from the specified list paired with explicit scale or impact information.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "“So, just like COVID, I don't know what next year's going to hold.”", "article_id": 760, "thoughts": "**Q3 Analysis: A Clear No**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text: \"So, just like COVID, I don't know what next year's going to hold.\" My task is straightforward: does this satisfy the criteria of Q3? That boils down to checking for two key ingredients: a \"moderate verb\" from that specific list, and some explicit scale or impact data.\n\nFirst, I parsed the text. The relevant verbs are \"know\" and \"hold\".  Neither of them, however, are on the provided list of moderate verbs. So that's the first strike.\n\nNext, I looked for scale or impact information. The phrase \"what next year's going to hold\" is indeed a statement about future uncertainty. But it doesn't quantify anything. There's no numerical data, no percentages, no comparisons to a historical record, nothing that indicates the *magnitude* of the potential future. No record-breaking losses, no significant damage, no overwhelming impact.\n\nSince I found neither of the required elements—a moderate verb *or* any explicit scale or impact information—the answer to Q3 is a definitive \"no\". We move on.\n"}
