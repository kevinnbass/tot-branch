Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to look for any intensifiers or comparatives that might be directly modifying a risk-related adjective. The only word that really jumps out is \"soared.\" It implies a significant increase, but it's a verb, describing the price's action, not an intensifier or comparative.\n\nI scan the text again, this time focusing on potential risk adjectives, words that describe potential hazard or harm. I don't see anything that qualifies, nothing like \"dangerous,\" \"deadly,\" or anything similar.\n\nSo, the pattern I'm looking for doesn't exist. \"Soared\" doesn't modify a risk adjective. Furthermore, there are no comparatives or any idioms that imply immediate harm. So, no.\nThe answer to Q1 is \"no.\"\n"}
