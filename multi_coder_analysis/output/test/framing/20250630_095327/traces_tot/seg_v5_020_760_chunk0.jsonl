{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'very' modifying 'heartbreaking', but 'heartbreaking' is not a risk-adjective as defined in Q1 (e.g., deadly, dangerous, severe).", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "to have that opportunity maybe not be there can be very heartbreaking.”", "article_id": 760, "thoughts": "**Assessing Risk Language in the Text**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"to have that opportunity maybe not be there can be very heartbreaking.\" My task is to apply the first question (Q1) of the decision tree to this. Q1 is looking for intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly modifying a *risk-adjective*. Essentially, it's a test for language that's amplifying the severity of a described risk.\n\nI need to determine if \"very heartbreaking\" fits this pattern. I can see the intensifier \"very\" modifying the adjective \"heartbreaking\". The challenge here is determining if \"heartbreaking\" qualifies as a *risk-adjective* according to our definitions. The examples given – 'deadly', 'dangerous', 'severe', 'catastrophic', etc. – are all related to physical hazards or the severity of a disease.\n\n\"Heartbreaking,\" in this context, refers to an emotional state. It describes the emotional impact of a potential loss. It doesn't signal a physical risk or hazard. Therefore, \"very heartbreaking\" doesn't fit the specified \"Intensifier + Risk-Adjective\" pattern. The answer to Q1 is \"no,\" and my analysis is complete.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The phrase 'very heartbreaking' describes an emotional reaction, not the event's impact using a high-potency verb, potent metaphor, or other Q2 trigger as defined by the rules.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "to have that opportunity maybe not be there can be very heartbreaking.”", "article_id": 760, "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Analyzing the Segment Against Q2 Criteria**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess this text fragment, `\"to have that opportunity maybe not be there can be very heartbreaking,\"` through the lens of Question 2 in the decision tree: Does it contain a high-potency verb, a potent metaphor, or other similar trigger phrases?\n\nMy initial analysis reveals the phrase \"very heartbreaking.\"  While \"heartbreaking\" is certainly emotionally charged, and \"very\" intensifies that emotion, it doesn't quite hit the mark for Q2.\n\nThe rules clearly state that \"Emotional reactions alone ≠ vivid language.\"  The fragment describes a feeling, an emotional response. It's akin to the example of \"very sad,\" which is explicitly ruled out as not meeting the vivid language requirement.  The impact itself is not vividly depicted with a strong verb or potent metaphor, the way \"devastating heartbreak\" would be. There's no critical alert phrase, superlative + negative noun, or intensifier + harm noun here either.\n\nTherefore, because \"very heartbreaking\" describes an intensified emotion, but doesn't employ vivid language like a high-potency verb or potent metaphor to describe the situation, the answer is unequivocally \"no.\"\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment contains no moderate verb from the specified list paired with scale or impact information.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "to have that opportunity maybe not be there can be very heartbreaking.”", "article_id": 760, "thoughts": "**Q3 Assessment: \"Heartbreaking\" Opportunity Loss**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. The user wants me to apply Q3 of the decision tree to this phrase: \"to have that opportunity maybe not be there can be very heartbreaking.\"\n\nFirst, I need to isolate the segment. Check. Got it. Now, the goal is to look for a moderate verb combined with an explicit indicator of scale or impact. I need to make a judgment call here, as the terms are slightly subjective.\n\nLooking at the segment, the only verb present is \"be.\" I immediately scan for verbs on the approved moderate list like 'hit', 'swept', 'soared', and so on. \"Be\" isn't there. So that's the first test - fails.\n\nNow I look for those scale or impact indicators. I see \"heartbreaking\". It is very evocative, but it describes an emotional impact, not a quantifiable change. The \"millions culled\" and \"record losses\" types of information, it’s missing. It’s not a percentage, a comparative term, or a descriptor of a physical or economic effect. The impact described is emotional in nature, but not the type we're looking for under Q3.\n\nTherefore, because there's no moderate verb paired with explicit scale/impact information (as defined for Q3), the answer is \"no.\" This means I don't emit \"Alarmist\" and I move on to the next question in the decision tree - Q4.\n"}
