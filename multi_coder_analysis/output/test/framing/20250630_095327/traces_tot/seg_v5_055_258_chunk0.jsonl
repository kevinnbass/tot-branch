{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment reports factual data (number of infections, types of animals) without using intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture alone reports 110 reports of mammalian infections with H5N1 in 2022-2023 multiple types of bears, foxes, skunks, possums, raccoons, even seals.", "article_id": 258, "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Intensified Risk Claims**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture alone reports 110 reports of mammalian infections with H5N1 in 2022-2023 multiple types of bears, foxes, skunks, possums, raccoons, even seals.\" My task is to act as a claim-framing coder, essentially, and run this through a 12-step decision tree, starting with Q1.\n\nQ1 wants me to check if this segment contains an intensifier or a comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. So, I need to look for those patterns: something like \"very dangerous,\" \"more severe,\" or \"so catastrophic.\"\n\nI quickly scanned the text. No intensifiers like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or \"so\" are present. There's no comparative language either, no \"more\" or \"less\" of anything. And more importantly, there aren't any explicit risk-adjectives like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" or \"severe\" at all. What I *do* see is a factual statement about reported infections and a list of affected animal species. That's data, not a claim that needs framing.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" There's no evidence of the specific pattern the question is looking for: an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective. I'll return the JSON with `{\"answer\":\"no\", \"rationale\":\"The segment does not contain any intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives; it presents factual data about reported infections and affected species.\"}` and move on to Q2, as the instructions stipulate.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('reports') and lists factual information without employing high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 cues.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture alone reports 110 reports of mammalian infections with H5N1 in 2022-2023 multiple types of bears, foxes, skunks, possums, raccoons, even seals.", "article_id": 258, "thoughts": "**Assessing for High-Potency Language**\n\nOkay, I'm being asked to apply my expertise to this text segment and see if it triggers Q2 in the decision tree: do we have any high-potency verbs or potent metaphors here? The text reads, \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture alone reports 110 reports of mammalian infections with H5N1 in 2022-2023 multiple types of bears, foxes, skunks, possums, raccoons, even seals.\"\n\nRight away, I see that the core of this is a factual statement. My analytical lens immediately homes in on the language: \"reports\" is a completely neutral, descriptive verb. \"Mammalian infections\" is precise scientific terminology, certainly not charged with any emotional or impactful connotations. The list of affected animals? Pure data. No superlatives, no intensifiers paired with negative nouns, no ticking time bombs or nightmare scenarios.\n\nMy conclusion is clear: This segment does *not* contain any of the linguistic cues Q2 is looking for. It's a straightforward presentation of data. Therefore, the answer is \"no.\" My rationale? Simply put, the requisite high-potency verbs or potent metaphors are absent. It's all factual and neutral language.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The verb 'reports' is not on the list of moderate verbs required for Q3 to fire.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture alone reports 110 reports of mammalian infections with H5N1 in 2022-2023 multiple types of bears, foxes, skunks, possums, raccoons, even seals.", "article_id": 258, "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Q3 Relevance**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture alone reports 110 reports of mammalian infections with H5N1 in 2022-2023 multiple types of bears, foxes, skunks, possums, raccoons, even seals,\" and I need to determine if it triggers Q3 of the decision tree. Q3, as I know, focuses on *moderate verbs* paired with *explicit scale or impact information*.\n\nFirst, I need to pinpoint the verb and see if it's on my list of moderate verbs. In this case, the verb is \"reports\". Now, \"reports\" *isn't* on the list, so that's a key point. Then I checked for any scale indicators and found \"110 reports\".  The key here is that Q3 is looking for a *specific* pairing of a moderate verb and a scale indicator, like \"surged to 1000\" or \"plummeted by 50%.\"  \"Reports\" doesn't fit that pattern. I confirmed that there are no containment verbs or financial/trade metrics. I confirmed \"reports\" describes realised impact. Given the strict requirements of Q3, and the verb not being on my list, the answer to Q3 is definitively \"no.\" Therefore, the next step is Q4.\n"}
