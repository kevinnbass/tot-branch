This means I'm looking for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. Keeping the `TECH_TERM_GUARD` firmly in mind is crucial here, as it dictates how I should treat specific technical terms.\n\nLet's break down the segment: \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in five more states across the country after officials warned that the recent outbreaks could see Americans paying more for poultry.\"\n\nThe `TECH_TERM_GUARD` immediately flags \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\" as a neutral label. Therefore, even though \"highly\" is an intensifier, it's modifying a taxonomic label, not a risk-adjective that would be relevant to this question. That whole phrase is effectively a non-starter for Q1.\n\nNext, I see \"more states.\" While \"more\" is indeed a comparative adjective, it's modifying \"states,\" a noun, not a risk-adjective. Similarly, \"more for poultry\" is a comparative, but it modifies the cost, not a risk-related adjective.\n\nAfter a careful scan, I'm confident that there are no intensifiers or comparatives directly modifying a risk-adjective within this text segment. Therefore, the answer to Q1 is definitively \"no\". I'll be sure to represent this in the requested JSON format.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('confirmed cases', 'warned', 'outbreaks') and lacks high-potency verbs or potent metaphors as defined in Q2 rules.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in five more states across the country after officials warned that the recent outbreaks could see Americans paying more for poultry.", "article_id": 1055, "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: Avian Influenza Outbreak**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to assess this text segment against Q2 â€“ specifically, are there any high-potency verbs or potent metaphors in play? Here's my thinking:\n\nFirst, I've got to focus on any verbs and nouns directly related to the threat itself or its impact. I see \"confirmed cases,\" which is pretty straightforward and neutral.  \"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\" is a technical term, and I know I have to treat those cautiously, especially given the rules.  I'm not going to let a technical term get me excited.\n\nThen there's \"warned.\" This is a psychological verb, and those can be tricky. But, the rules say it's neutral unless it's paired with a vivid intensifier or describes realized harm.  The segment doesn't say \"will\" see higher poultry prices, it says \"could.\"  That's a future possibility, not a concrete, realized negative impact, so I'm not going to consider it high-potency here.\n\n\"Outbreaks\" is also neutral.  And finally, \"paying more for poultry\" is about the potential economic impact, not a powerful verb or metaphor. The structure \"could see\" isn't a high-potency construction.\n\nLooking at the segment as a whole, none of the words or phrases match the examples of high-potency verbs or potent metaphors in the pattern recognition table.  So, the answer to Q2 is definitely \"no.\" I'll need to explain this and reference my reasoning based on the lack of high-potency language.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment uses 'confirmed cases' and 'warned', neither of which are on the moderate verb list. The potential impact ('could see Americans paying more') is hypothetical, not realised, and paired with 'could see', not a moderate verb.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in five more states across the country after officials warned that the recent outbreaks could see Americans paying more for poultry.", "article_id": 1055, "thoughts": "**Q3 Decision: Analyzing the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this text segment: \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in five more states across the country after officials warned that the recent outbreaks could see Americans paying more for poultry.\" The goal is to determine if it triggers Q3 of the decision tree, which hinges on the presence of a \"moderate verb\" coupled with explicit scale or impact information.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the moderate verbs we're looking for, things like \"HIT,\" \"SOARE,\" or \"SPIKED.\"  I'm quickly scanning the segment.  \"Confirmed,\" \"warned,\" and \"could see\" immediately jump out. None of those match my pre-defined list of moderate verbs.\n\nNext, I'm looking for scale or impact indicators.  \"Five more states\" definitely looks like a numerical scale, and \"paying more for poultry\" clearly implies an economic impact. However, the connection between these elements is key.  \"Five more states\" relates to \"confirmed cases,\" not a moderate verb. \"Paying more\" is tied to \"could see,\" which is hypothetical, not a direct impact.\n\nThe rules are pretty clear. The moderate verb *must* be explicitly paired with the scale indicator and it must denote a *realised* impact. I'm not seeing that pairing. \"Paying more\" is a future possibility, not a concrete outcome.\n\nGiven these findings, I conclude that Q3 is not triggered.  The \"confirmed\" verb is neutral, not on my list, and the potential impact is future-focused. Therefore, I need to proceed to the next question in the decision tree (Q4).\n"}
