I immediately see \"pretty steadily\". Now, the critical part: are they modifying a risk-adjective?  No. I don't see any words that could be considered risk-adjectives in this segment.  The sentence talks about price increases, not about risks. \"Pretty steadily\" describes *how* the price climbed, the rate of increase, not the danger level of the chicken or the price itself.\n\nTherefore, applying the Q1 rule directly, since there's no risk-adjective being modified, I'm confident in concluding that this segment *does not* contain the required structure.  My output will be formatted as JSON with `\"answer\": \"no\"` and a rationale clearly stating my reasoning.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The verb 'climbed pretty steadily' is a moderate verb describing a trend, not a high-potency verb or potent metaphor that actively frames the situation alarmingly.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "The average price per pound of a whole chicken has climbed pretty steadily since it was at $1.62 in January 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics latest consumer price data.", "article_id": 358, "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text for Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment: \"The average price per pound of a whole chicken has climbed pretty steadily since it was at $1.62 in January 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics latest consumer price data.\" My task is to act as a claim-framing expert, specifically focusing on Question Q2 of that 12-step decision tree. I need to determine if this segment employs a high-potency verb or potent metaphor to frame the situation alarmingly.\n\nMy brain immediately goes through the checklist: high-potency verbs like \"skyrocketed,\" superlative + negative noun combinations, critical alert phrases, and potent metaphors. I scan the text and zero in on the verb \"climbed.\" Is \"climbed\" a high-potency verb? Not really. It describes a trend, but not with the explosive force of something like \"skyrocketed\" or \"devastated.\" Is it a moderate verb? Perhaps, in the sense that it does describe a change.\n\nThen I get to the phrase \"climbed pretty steadily.\" That \"pretty steadily\" is crucial. It softens the impact. The goal is to identify alarmist framing here. A sharp increase might trigger the alarm bells, but a steady increase suggests a more gradual, perhaps even predictable, shift. This reminds me of the example from the Q2 rules: \"Egg prices have been *trending sharply higher* in recent weeks,\" which is explicitly categorized as Neutral. \"Trending sharply higher\" is likely more intense and dramatic than \"climbed pretty steadily\"\n\nFollowing the rules, \"climbed pretty steadily\" doesn't hit the mark. It describes a trend factually, but doesn't actively frame the situation alarmingly. I have to deliver the answer to Q2. It's a \"no.\"\n\nFor my rationale, I'll quote the relevant part: \"climbed pretty steadily.\" and I will explain that \"climbed pretty steadily\" is a moderate verb describing a trend, and not a high-potency verb or potent metaphor that would suggest an alarmist framing. The phrase \"pretty steadily\" signals a less dramatic trend, and doesn't meet the criteria for Q2.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The verb 'climbed' is not on the list of moderate verbs required for Q3.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "The average price per pound of a whole chicken has climbed pretty steadily since it was at $1.62 in January 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics latest consumer price data.", "article_id": 358, "thoughts": "**Q3 Decision: Analyzing the Provided Text**\n\nOkay, I'm diving in. The user wants me to assess this text snippet against Q3 of the decision tree. That means I need to look for a 'moderate verb' combined with some kind of 'significant scale or impact' information.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the segment: \"The average price per pound of a whole chicken has climbed pretty steadily since it was at $1.62 in January 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics latest consumer price data.\"\n\nNow, I'm going to quickly scan for those moderate verbs. Let's see...I have my mental list: HIT, SWEPT, SOARED, SURGED, PLUMMETED, PROMPTED, SPIKED, PEAKED, JUMPED, SHOT UP, and HARD HIT. Ah, I see \"climbed\" in the text, but that's not on my list.\n\nI'll double-check the Q3 Pattern Recognition Table just to be sure. Yep, the table specifically lists things like \"spiked,\" \"peaked,\" \"jumped,\" and \"shot up\" as examples that pair with scale. \"Climbed\" isn't there.\n\nI know I need to be exact here, so I'm going to refer to the Detailed Rules and Examples. The rules clearly state that the verb *has* to be in the approved list or match the regex. \"Climbed\" isn't in either of those.\n\nNow, let's assess the scale or impact. The text definitely provides some scale: \"$1.62 in January 2022\" and mentions a price increase. That's a specific data point. However, the rule is clear: the verb has to be on the approved list.\n\nApplying the rules, since \"climbed\" isn't a moderate verb from the approved list for Q3, the Q3 condition is *not* met.\n\nSo, the answer is \"no\".\n\nTo be thorough, the rationale will be: The verb \"climbed\" is present, but it is not listed among the defined 'moderate verbs' used for the Q3 evaluation.\n"}
