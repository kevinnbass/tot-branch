{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.

First, I have to figure out if it contains an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.  Let's break this down:\n\n*   **Risk-Adjective:**  The key word here is \"worrying\".  My initial thought is that \"worrying\" isn't a *risk-adjective* in the way the decision tree intends.  It describes a psychological state, a feeling of concern.  I'm thinking of \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" or \"severe\" – those are the adjectives that describe the threat itself, not the reaction to it. I want to make sure I'm following the precise definitions used in the tree.\n*   **Intensifiers/Comparatives:** Now, I'm looking at the phrase \"ever stopped.\"  That's clearly modifying the verb \"worrying,\" not the adjective.  It's indicating that the worrying *continued*, which is interesting, but it's not the kind of direct intensifier the question is looking for. \"None of them\" is a quantifier and does not act as an intensifier.\n\nSo, the pattern I'm looking for (intensifier + risk-adjective) just isn't there.  \"Worrying\" isn't the right kind of adjective, and there's no intensifier modifying it anyway.\n\nI can move on because I'm only answering Q1. Based on my analysis, Q1 does not apply to this segment. The answer is 'no'. I already know that based on the next steps of the decision tree, the 'psychological verbs' context guard likely covers this, and describes the lack of amplification of the worry as 'Neutral'. I'll keep that in mind.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment uses the psychological verb 'worrying' but does not employ a high-potency verb, potent metaphor, or critical alert phrase as defined in Q2. Psychological verbs alone are Neutral unless amplified or linked to scale.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "None of them ever stopped worrying about H5N1.", "article_id": 258, "thoughts": "**Q2 Evaluation: \"None of them ever stopped worrying about H5N1\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with analyzing the phrase \"None of them ever stopped worrying about H5N1\" in the context of Q2, looking for high-potency verbs or potent metaphors. Let's break this down. First, the segment itself: \"None of them ever stopped worrying about H5N1.\"  My initial pass shows me the key verb is \"stopped worrying.\" \"Stopped\" is a pretty neutral word, not particularly evocative.  \"Worrying\" is more of a psychological state, not a strong action verb like \"decimated\" or \"erupted.\"\n\nNow, let's go through the checklist.  High-potency verbs? Nope. Potent metaphors? Nothing like a \"ticking time bomb\" here. The rules for Q2 point out the significance of psychological verbs. \"Worrying\" clearly falls into that category, but it's *not* used with a vivid intensifier (like \"mass panic\") or coupled with a specific scale of harm. It simply states that worry *existed*.\n\nI'm considering the constraints – am I staying grounded in the text provided? Absolutely. Is the framing neutral? It appears to be. I am applying the active-rhetoric principle, and while \"worrying\" could be perceived negatively in a given context, the *presentation* of the information (\"stopped worrying\") isn't using alarmist language. Following the context guard for psychological verbs, I see no strong intensifier or scale of harm here.\n\nSo, according to Q2, the answer is a clear \"no.\" The segment doesn't use high-potency verbs or potent metaphors. It's a statement about a state of mind, not a highly charged description.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment 'None of them ever stopped worrying' does not contain a moderate verb from the specified list paired with explicit scale or impact information.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "None of them ever stopped worrying about H5N1.", "article_id": 258, "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Segment \"None of them ever stopped worrying about H5N1\" against Q3**\n\nOkay, so the task at hand is to analyze the phrase \"None of them ever stopped worrying about H5N1\" and determine if it satisfies the criteria of Q3 in the decision tree.  My initial step, naturally, is to isolate the segment.\n\nNext, I'll need to check for the presence of a \"moderate verb\" as defined by the decision tree.  I'm quickly scanning the segment for the list I have in mind: *HIT, SWEPT, SOARED, SURGED, PLUMMETED, PROMPTED, SPIKED, PEAKED, JUMPED, SHOT UP, HARD HIT*.  \"Stopped worrying\" is the key phrase.  *Stopped* isn't on the list, and *worrying* is a psychological state, which isn't what the tree is looking for.  It's about physical impact or scale, not internal feelings.  So, no checkmark there.\n\nThen, I'm on the lookout for explicit scale or impact information. The segment mentions H5N1, which is the subject, but there are no numbers, percentages, or comparative terms – nothing that speaks to the magnitude or effect of the worry.  No \"record,\" \"largest,\" \"devastating,\" nothing like that.  So, I see no evidence of scale or impact information being used.\n\nTherefore, since I'm not finding either the required moderate verb *or* the corresponding scale/impact information, the condition for Q3 isn't met.  The answer is definitely \"no\".  My rationale would be simple: the phrase fails to include the necessary combination of a moderate verb coupled with explicit scale or impact information, as Q3 demands.  It's just not there.\n"}
