{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment contains 'major problem'. 'Major' is an intensifier, but 'problem' is a noun, not a risk-adjective as defined by Q1.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "'I think it's a major problem for the agricultural industry.", "article_id": 258, "thoughts": "**Applying the Decision Tree: Q1 Examination**\n\nAlright, I'm diving into this segment: \"'I think it's a major problem for the agricultural industry.\" My task is to see if it triggers Q1 of the decision tree. This means I'm looking for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a *risk-adjective* as defined by our criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to pinpoint any potential risk-adjectives. \"Problem\" jumps out. Is \"problem\" on my list of risk-adjectives: deadly, dangerous, severe, catastrophic, lethal, contagious, virulent, or destructive? No, it's a noun. Strike one.\n\nNext, I scan for intensifiers or comparatives. \"Major\" catches my eye.  \"Major\" can definitely intensify something â€“ implying significance. It's potentially an intensifier.\n\nBut here's the crucial step: does \"major\" directly modify a *risk-adjective*?  Nope.  \"Major\" modifies \"problem.\" Although \"major problem\" suggests seriousness, Q1 is very specific. It wants a direct connection to one of those defined *risk-adjectives*.  Since \"problem\" isn't a *risk-adjective*, Q1 isn't met.\n\nThe rule's clear:  \"major\" can modify severity, but not *this* instance's defined severity. So, I move on; Q1 doesn't apply here.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The phrase 'major problem' uses an intensifier ('major') with a negative noun ('problem'), fitting the 'Intensifier + Harm Noun' pattern in Q2.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "'I think it's a major problem for the agricultural industry.", "article_id": 258, "thoughts": "**Analysis of \"major problem\" for Q2 Evaluation**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with evaluating the phrase \"major problem\" against the Q2 criteria, specifically focusing on Alarmist language. My initial thought is to break down the phrase.  \"Major\" is clearly an intensifier, suggesting a significant scale. \"Problem\" is a negative noun, indicating some form of difficulty or harm.\n\nNow, let's review the Q2 rules. It's looking for high-potency verbs, superlatives, and intensifiers combined with negative nouns (what they call \"harm nouns\"). The specific examples given are strong, like \"most expensive disaster\" or \"record outbreak.\" While \"major problem\" isn't *as* dramatic, the rule *explicitly* states \"Intensifier + Harm Noun\" applies. The table is clear that this pattern falls under the Q2 umbrella.\n\nThe key question becomes whether \"problem\" fits as a \"harm noun\" here.  Though not explicitly listed, the \"etc.\" in the rule implies a broader category.  \"Problem\" certainly conveys a negative consequence or difficulty. Therefore, it feels correct to include it in this category, representing \"harm.\"  The rule's intent seems to be capturing instances where the scale of a negative outcome is emphasized. \"Major problem\" definitely does that.\n\nConsidering the \"Boundary Guard,\" it doesn't apply here because it focuses on verbs. The \"Context Guard\" for vivid language and psychological verbs is irrelevant here.\n\nBased on the explicit \"Intensifier + Harm Noun\" rule within Q2 and the nature of \"problem,\" I conclude that \"major problem\" triggers the Alarmist category. The \"major\" intensifies the \"problem,\" indicating a significant scale of difficulty or harm. My final answer: **yes**.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment contains an evaluative adjective ('major') and a general impact statement ('problem for the agricultural industry'), but no moderate verb from the specified list paired with explicit scale/impact.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "'I think it's a major problem for the agricultural industry.", "article_id": 258, "thoughts": "**Q3 Analysis: Evaluating \"I think it's a major problem for the agricultural industry.\"**\n\nOkay, so the task is to analyze that phrase against Q3 of the decision tree. Let's see... the phrase is \"'I think it's a major problem for the agricultural industry.\" First, I need to check for those *moderate verbs* Q3 is looking for. Scanning... nope. \"Major problem\" is an evaluative phrase, an *adjective* modifying a *noun*, not one of the verbs on the list like \"soared\" or \"plummeted.\"\n\nNow, is there any *explicit* scale or impact mentioned?  \"Major\" is an intensifier, but it doesn't give me specific numbers or percentages.  And the \"agricultural industry\" is the affected entity, not any concrete measure of the problem's magnitude. It's a general statement about the impact.\n\nLet's run through the Q3 checks: no moderate verb, no explicit scale or impact. Although it's an existing issue (not a hypothetical), there's no containment override and it's not financial.\n\nSo, according to the criteria of Q3, the answer has to be \"no.\" I'll need to move on to the next question in the tree, but that's beyond the scope of this particular prompt.\n"}
