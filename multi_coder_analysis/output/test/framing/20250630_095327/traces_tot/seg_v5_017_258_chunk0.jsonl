{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "'I just don't know what it's going to do.'", "article_id": 258, "thoughts": "**Navigating the First Decision Point**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase: \"'I just don't know what it's going to do.'\" and the task is to run it through the first question of this decision tree. That question, Q1, focuses on whether the segment intensifies or compares a risk-related adjective. \n\nLet's break it down. I'm looking for intensifiers – things like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"highly,\" or comparisons like \"more,\" \"deadlier.\"  I also need to see if those modifiers are *directly* modifying a risk-related adjective.  The segment doesn't contain any of these intensifiers. It's a statement of uncertainty.\n\nNext, I scan for risk-related adjectives—terms like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" \"catastrophic,\" \"lethal,\" etc.  Again, there's no such adjective here. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about the future, maybe about the virus or the situation as a whole, but that uncertainty isn't being framed in terms of intensified or compared risks.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is definitely \"no.\" We move on to the next question.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment expresses uncertainty ('don't know what it's going to do') but does not contain any high-potency verbs, critical alert phrases, or potent metaphors listed in the Q2 criteria.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "'I just don't know what it's going to do.'", "article_id": 258, "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Q2 Criteria**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"'I just don't know what it's going to do.'\" and tasked with evaluating it against the Q2 criteria. My initial thought is to break down the task: I need to determine if this phrase contains high-potency verbs, alert phrases, or potent metaphors.\n\nI know Q2 is all about spotting vivid, impactful language. Think verbs like \"devastated\" or phrases that scream \"danger,\" like \"code red.\"  Or, even those powerful metaphors that paint a picture, like a \"ticking time bomb.\"\n\nNow, looking at \"'I just don't know what it's going to do,'\" I see a straightforward expression of uncertainty. There's no hyperbolic language, no specific verbs that suggest significant impact, and certainly no potent metaphors that convey a heightened sense of threat or urgency. It’s simply a statement of personal lack of knowledge, perhaps about the future.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, the answer is \"no.\" This particular phrase does not meet the criteria outlined by Q2.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment contains no moderate verb from the specified list, nor any explicit scale or impact information.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "'I just don't know what it's going to do.'", "article_id": 258, "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Decision Tree Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the segment: \"'I just don't know what it's going to do.'\" and asked to assess it against Q3 of the decision tree. Q3, as I understand it, is looking for a \"moderate verb\" paired with some kind of explicit scale or impact descriptor. Let's break this down:\n\nFirst, I identified the verbs. We have \"know\" and \"going to do.\" Now, the list of 'moderate verbs' is pretty specific: HIT, SWEPT, SOARED, SURGED, PLUMMETED, PROMPTED, SPIKED, PEAKED, JUMPED, SHOT UP, HARD HIT. Neither \"know\" nor \"going to do\" is on that list. So, that's strike one.\n\nNext, I need to check for any explicit scale or impact information – things like percentages, numbers, mentions of \"millions,\" or descriptive terms like \"devastating\" or \"widespread.\" There's nothing like that here. It's a statement of uncertainty about the *future*, not a description of *present* or *past* effects.\n\nEven if we *did* have a moderate verb, there's nothing to pair it with. The statement lacks any context that quantifies or qualifies the action. The other checks for containment override, financial/trade metrics, and realised impact are also not relevant here.\n\nTherefore, since we have no moderate verb and no scale/impact data, Q3 does not fire. The answer is a clear \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the segment contains neither a moderate verb from the defined list nor any associated scale or impact information.\n"}
