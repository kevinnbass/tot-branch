{"Q": 1, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'bird flu' and its impact on 'egg prices soared nearly 60%', but does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective describing the flu itself.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "In the US, egg prices soared nearly 60% in 2022 due to bird flu hitting supply and higher input costs, Insider's George Glover reported in January.", "article_id": 1282, "thoughts": "**My Assessment of Intensifiers and Risk-Adjectives**\n\nOkay, so I need to check if this segment contains an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective, specifically adhering to the Q1 guidelines. Let's see...\n\nFirst, I need to break down the text: \"In the US, egg prices soared nearly 60% in 2022 due to bird flu hitting supply and higher input costs, Insider's George Glover reported in January.\"\n\nMy immediate thought is to scan for those key risk-adjectives – *deadly, dangerous, severe, catastrophic, lethal, contagious, virulent, destructive* – the usual suspects. Nope, none of those are in there.\n\nNext, I look for intensifiers or comparatives. I spot \"nearly 60%\" and \"higher\". However, \"nearly 60%\" modifies \"soared,\" which is a description of the *price increase*, not the bird flu's inherent characteristics. \"Higher\" modifies \"input costs,\" which is also not describing the disease itself.\n\nThen, I'm checking if the Q1 pattern is present: does an intensifier or comparative directly modify a risk-adjective? No, not at all. The segment talks about \"bird flu\" impacting supply but doesn't use those risk-adjectives, which I was looking for, modified by an intensifier. Instead, we have a vivid verb: 'soared' to describe the prices in response to the conditions, so the context is background and impact as opposed to the nature of the disease.\n\nTherefore, because I can't find that specific pattern, the answer, as I see it, is a clear \"no\".\n"}
