{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: Intensifier/Comparative Adjective Modification of Risk-Adjective**\n\nOkay, so I'm at Step Q1. My task is to scrutinize this text segment, acting as a claim-framing coder, to see if it includes an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.  I need to find the pattern: (intensifier|comparative) + risk-adjective.\n\nLet's break down this segment: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\"\n\nFirst, I quickly scan for any phrases that fit the target pattern. \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths...\" Nothing there. Then, I notice \"of at least 25,000 turkeys...\"  \"At least\" looks like an intensifier, but it's modifying a quantifier, not a risk-adjective.  \"Turkeys\" isn't a risk-adjective in this context either. Finally,  \"...in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\"  No dice there either.\n\nThe segment *does* discuss \"deaths,\" which is clearly a negative outcome, but that's not what I'm looking for at this stage. Q1 is *specifically* interested in intensifiers or comparatives that modify a risk-adjective. I'm also mindful that the number \"25,000\" is a scale/metric that relates to Q3.  I'm focused on the *structure* of the phrase as defined by Q1. The segment doesn't use that structure.\n\nTherefore, after a thorough analysis, my answer is \"no\".  The segment lacks the required pattern of an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text uses factual language ('is responsible for the deaths of') and does not employ high-potency verbs or potent metaphors to frame the situation alarmingly.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Evaluation: Bird Flu Outbreak**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\" My task is to evaluate this against Q2 of the decision tree. I need to determine if it contains any \"high-potency verbs\" or \"potent metaphors\" that actively frame the situation alarmingly.\n\nFirst, I identified the verbs: \"say,\" \"is responsible for,\" and \"deaths.\" \"Say\" is neutral reporting. \"Is responsible for\" is a factual statement of causality. \"Deaths\" is a noun describing the consequence. I know from my expertise that the presentation is key, and it's about the language used, not just the negative fact itself.\n\nI checked these verbs against the list of high-potency examples in Q2, as well as the potent metaphors. None of them match. The text simply states a fact: that 25,000 turkeys have died and that bird flu is the cause. The language used, while describing a tragic event, is neutral. It's simply saying \"is responsible for the deaths of,\" which is factual, not alarmist.\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the Bedrock Principle and the Symmetry Rule: I'm coding the *presentation*, not just the facts. The language here does not actively amplify the negative facts to create an alarmist framing.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q2 is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states the flu 'is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys'. While it includes scale ('at least 25,000 turkeys'), it does not use a moderate verb from the specified list (e.g., hit, swept, surged, soared, plummeted, prompted, culled) paired with this scale information.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Evaluation - My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, the task is to evaluate this text segment against Q3 of the decision tree. I know Q3 is looking for two things: a \"moderate verb\" from a specific list, and explicit scale or impact information. The segment is: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\"\n\nLet's break it down: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say...\" is attribution. \"...bird flu is responsible for...\" is the cause.  \"...the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys...\" is the impact (deaths) with a scale (at least 25,000).  \"...in poultry farms...\" is location.\n\nNow, checking against the Q3 criteria. First, the moderate verb. The event is described as bird flu being \"responsible for the deaths of\". The verb related to the impact is essentially \"deaths\" (or being \"responsible\"). Is \"deaths\" a moderate verb from the list (hit, swept, surged, etc.)? No.  Nor is \"responsible for\". The phrase \"is responsible for the deaths of\" is factual; it's not a verb from the Q3 list.\n\nSecond, the scale/impact. \"At least 25,000 turkeys\" *is* explicit scale information. So, one part of the pattern is there.\n\nHowever, the rule requires *both* the moderate verb AND the scale. Since the core verb describing the impact is \"deaths\" and \"is responsible for\", and neither is on the list, the Q3 pattern isn't fully satisfied.\n\nReviewing the Q3 definition again: the presence of a \"moderate verb\" paired with significant impact or scale info. The example in the rules helps clarify this, and the regex pattern confirms the search for specific verbs: `\\b(hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|culled)\\b`.\n\nMy judgment confirms the text doesn't contain a moderate verb from the list. The verb phrase is \"is responsible for the deaths of,\" with the key action being \"deaths.\" While we have scale (\"at least 25,000\"), the crucial verb component is missing from the required list.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"no\" for Q3. The rationale is the segment provides scale (25,000+ turkeys), but it lacks a qualifying \"moderate verb\" from the pre-defined list that must be paired with such scale."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement reporting facts and contains no questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\" My task is to evaluate this based on Question 4 (Q4), which concerns itself with loaded rhetorical questions designed to induce alarm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Q4 is looking for. It's specifically asking about whether the text uses a rhetorical question to provoke fear or worry. It's a key distinction; Q4 is interested in how information is framed, not just the content itself.\n\nNow, I'm analyzing the segment. Immediately, I see it's a straightforward factual statement. There are no questions, rhetorical or otherwise. It simply reports on a situation â€“ the bird flu outbreak and its impact on turkey populations.\n\nSince there are no questions present, there can be no *loaded rhetorical questions*. My evaluation directly follows from this: I'm confident the answer to Q4 is \"no.\" This particular snippet, as written, is purely informative, absent any rhetorical devices designed to alarm the reader. It doesn't use questions at all."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text reports a negative event (bird flu deaths) and its scale but contains no explicit language from the author or source designed to calm concerns, declare safety, or minimize current risk.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Regarding Question Q5**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My task is to assess the provided text against Question Q5, which hinges on the presence of explicit calming cues or reassurances.  I need to determine if the text attempts to minimize concerns or provide a sense of safety regarding the reported bird flu outbreak.\n\nInitially, I identified the key elements within the text: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys...\"  This is a straightforward factual report.  It notes an undesirable event (turkey deaths) and provides a quantitative measure (\"at least 25,000\").  The information is attributed to \"Authorities.\"\n\nNow, comparing this to Q5, I see that the question seeks language like \"no cause for alarm,\" \"fully under control,\" or explicit risk minimization.  The text *doesn't* contain any of that.  It's simply a statement of fact, albeit a concerning one. I'm looking for direct assurances, amplified low-risk statements, positive framing, or statements of confidence concerning safety.  This text has none of those.\n\nReviewing the patterns and examples provided, it's clear this doesn't fit the \"Direct Safety Assurances,\" \"Low-Risk Evaluation (+ Intensifier),\" or any of the reassuring categories listed. It reports a negative event plainly, without any attempt to alleviate concerns.\n\nConsidering the definition and inclusion criteria of Q5, this text doesn't meet the requirements. It doesn't employ calming language or a positive spin on the situation.  It's more akin to the \"Neutral\" example in the minimal pair examples: a factual report, not a reassurance.\n\nChecking the regex confirms the obvious: the text does *not* match the pattern intended to identify calming language.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is clear. The text, while reporting a potentially serious event, does not contain explicit calming cues, reassurances, or attempts to minimize concern.  The answer to Question Q5 is unequivocally \"no.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The text reports a negative event (bird flu deaths) and provides a scale, attributed to authorities, but lacks any explicit calming language, intensified low-risk evaluations, or attempts to minimize concern. It does not fit the criteria outlined in Q5 for explicit reassuring language.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text mentions 'at least 25,000 turkeys' but lacks a minimiser or scale contrast used for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text for Q6**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\" My task is to evaluate it against Q6 of the decision tree, which is looking for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern used for reassurance.\n\nFirst, I scanned for a minimiser. The phrase \"at least 25,000 turkeys\" jumps out. But, \"at least\" is clearly *not* a minimiser; it implies the number could be *higher*, which runs contrary to the concept of minimising a negative impact.\n\nNext, I looked for a scale contrast. The text provides context: \"in poultry farms near the country's borders\". While this provides *some* framing, it doesn't offer a comparative scale that *minimises* the impact of the deaths. It doesn't present the 25,000 deaths in relation to a larger, more reassuring context, like \"out of millions\" or \"affecting only a few\".\n\nSince I found neither a minimiser nor a reassuring scale contrast, I have to conclude that the answer to Q6 is \"no\". The JSON response will be `{\"answer\":\"no\",\"rationale\":\"The text lacks a minimiser or scale contrast used for reassurance.\"}`. I'm ready to move on."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a negative event (deaths of turkeys) but does not contain any bare negation pattern like 'no cases', 'not expected', or 'unlikely to affect'.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Q7 - Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, I'm looking at this text segment, \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus,\" and the goal is to determine if it violates Q7, specifically looking for a *bare negation without an explicit calming cue*.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the criteria. I'm searching for direct negations â€“ words like \"no,\" \"not,\" \"unlikely,\" etc. â€“ within the context of risk or impact. In this example, the sentence describes a negative event: the death of turkeys due to bird flu. That's a definite negative outcome.\n\nNow, I scan for those negation words. I see \"say\" and \"responsible,\" but those aren't negating anything. There's no \"not\" or \"doesn't\" or \"improbable\" here. The segment directly states that bird flu *is* the cause.\n\nSince there is *no* negation present to begin with, I can stop there. The Q7 rule requires a negation to even be relevant. Therefore, my conclusion is clear: the segment does *not* contain a bare negation. The answer to Q7 is definitively \"no.\"\n\nMy rationale is straightforward: the text segment doesn't include any words or phrases that directly negate or downplay the risk or impact of bird flu. It's simply a factual statement reporting the cause of the turkeys' deaths."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative event (bird deaths) and its cause/location. It does not describe any capabilities, preparedness measures, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment Regarding Question Q8**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this text snippet against Question Q8. My task is to determine if this segment describes capabilities or preparedness measures, but *without* any form of active reassurance. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I examined the text itself: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\"\n\nNow, let's refresh our understanding of Q8. It's looking for those *specific* elements of capability, preparedness, or possible safeguards. Immediately, my expert eye scans for those key phrases and concepts. I'm looking for things like \"preparedness plans,\" \"safeguards in place,\" or mentions of systems designed to prevent or mitigate an event.\n\nI can't find anything that aligns with those criteria. Instead, the text is focused on reporting a negative event: bird flu-related deaths. It specifies that \"authorities\" are making a statement, but the statement itself doesn't contain the core elements Q8 is focused on. It doesn't allude to capabilities, or plans designed to deal with this, just a report.\n\nTherefore, since the segment lacks any description of capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards â€“ period - let alone *without* reassurance, the answer is clearly \"no.\" The segment is a factual report of the situation, not an evaluation of capabilities or preparedness strategies.\n\nTo explain this to the user, I'd prepare a rationale detailing that the text reports on the negative impacts of bird flu and does not mention any plans, systems, or protocols, and therefore doesn't meet the criteria of Q8. The resulting JSON object will then reflect that \"no\" answer, supported by this detailed explanation."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a quantity of animal deaths due to disease, not prices, economic data, or financial metrics as defined by Q9's scope and examples.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q9**\n\nOkay, I've been asked to analyze the text segment against question Q9 of the decision tree. Q9 focuses on whether the segment is *primarily* reporting prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics using standard verbs and potentially neutral adverbs, *without* vivid verbs, risk adjectives, or explicit alarmist/reassuring framing.\n\nMy initial thought is to break down the text: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\" Immediately, I see the numerical metric, \"at least 25,000 turkeys,\" so that part is clear.\n\nThe key is the *context* and the definition of \"numerical metrics\" within Q9. Does it mean *any* numerical data, or does it specifically pertain to economic and financial data as suggested by the provided examples and rules? The examples given in the decision tree - \"prices rose,\" \"costs declined,\" \"rates increased,\" \"values fell,\" etc. - all point to an economic context. They're clearly focused on market prices, costs, rates, values, losses, and profits.\n\nSo, while \"25,000 turkeys\" is indeed a quantity, it's a quantity of animal deaths *due to disease* not directly related to *economic* reporting. The verb \"deaths of\" isn't a typical economic verb; it simply indicates a quantity within a non-economic context.\n\nFurthermore, I have to consider the absence of vivid verbs, risk adjectives, and explicit framing. The segment is factual: \"responsible for the deaths.\" \"At least 25,000\" is also factual quantification, not an exaggeration or loaded statement. The overall tone is neutral reporting of a non-economic event.\n\nTherefore, although \"25,000 turkeys\" is a numerical metric, the context leans more towards a public health issue rather than economic reporting. Q9 seems to be designed specifically for economic reporting, and the examples support this interpretation. Consequently, I must conclude that the segment doesn't fit the criteria of Q9. I must proceed to the next question in the decision tree."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a past/present negative event (deaths) and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q10**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this text snippet: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\" against Q10 of the decision tree. Q10's core is straightforward: does the text *speculate* about future relief or improvement without explicitly calming the current situation?\n\nMy understanding is that I need to look for language hinting at future positivity, recovery, or easing of pressure. The text clearly describes a *current* negative situation â€“ the deaths of turkeys due to bird flu. It's a statement of fact about the present or recent past. It doesn't contain a hint of future improvement. No predictions about resolving the issue, no timeline, no hopeful language, nothing.\n\nTherefore, this text *doesn't* meet the criteria for Q10. The answer is clearly \"no.\" Although the decision tree would move on to the next question, I need to respond to this single interaction. My rationale: The segment reports a past/present negative event and does not speculate about future relief or improvement."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment attributes information to 'Authorities' but contains no direct quotations or attributed statements with explicit framing language.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment Regarding Question Q11**\n\nOkay, I've got a text segment to evaluate: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\" My task is to determine if this segment triggers Question Q11, which looks for a dominant framed quotation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the text. I see that it's reporting information attributed to \"Authorities in eastern Poland.\" However, there are no direct quotations here, meaning no words are explicitly enclosed in quotation marks, and no framing language that would imply the authority said something like \"alarming\" or \"reassuring\" to describe the situation. It just relays what they are reporting.\n\nGiven the criteria for Q11 â€“ a *directly quoted* source providing a *clear, dominant frame* (alarmist or reassuring) â€“ this segment doesn't meet the requirements. It lacks any direct quotes, so there's no way it can have a dominant frame.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q11 is \"no.\" My rationale will be straightforward: the segment doesn't contain a direct quotation or an attributed statement with explicit framing language, so the question is not triggered. Now, I'll package that information into the correct JSON format."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (deaths) using factual, descriptive language ('responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys') without explicit alarmist or reassuring framing cues.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment: Neutral Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm evaluating this text segment against the final hurdle, Q12. The task is to see if it's purely factual and descriptive, with *no* explicit alarmist or reassuring cues left. Let's break it down:\n\nEssentially, I'm confirming that after filtering out all potential alarmist and reassuring framings, what's left is simply a factual event described in a straightforward manner. The given text reports on the deaths of turkeys, specifically, a fairly large number.  I have to ensure that this report doesn't contain any language that implicitly exaggerates the event's significance, or downplays its importance.\n\nMy initial analysis reveals the core fact: \"Authorities say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys...\" It seems pretty straightforward on the surface. Looking at the language, it's factual: \"say,\" \"responsible for,\" \"at least,\" and a number, \"25,000,\" which indicates a minimum. The location details are also factual.\n\nI need to make sure there are no red flags, so I'm cross-checking for any alarmist framing cues. There are no \"dangerous,\" \"deadly,\" or other risk-related adjectives, or vivid verbs like \"ravaged\" or \"decimated,\" or excessive amplification of impact. The count, while significant, is simply stated and not exaggerated.  There are also no reassurance cues - nothing that tries to \"calm\" things down.\n\nSince the event is reported using factual language without exaggeration or mitigation, it's safe to say there is no alarmist or reassuring framing in this text.\n\nTherefore, since the presentation is factual, my conclusion is that it meets the criteria for Neutral framing. This would answer \"yes\" to Q12. The rationale supporting this is that the segment reports a negative fact, but does so in a factual and descriptive way."}
