It's not on the list of verbs like \""ravaged\"" or \""skyrocketed\"" that really inject that sense of urgency or danger. It's a fairly neutral, descriptive verb, just stating an action.\n\nNext, I looked for any metaphors that might be painting a particularly vivid picture, like \""ticking time-bomb\"" or something similar. Nothing like that here. This is just a straightforward statement about access control.\n\nThen I checked for that superlative + negative noun combo, like \""worst crisis\"" or \""most devastating outcome.\""  Nada. No superlatives at all, let alone paired with a negative.\n\nFinally, I kept my eyes peeled for any critical alert phrases \u2013 phrases that would immediately signal a heightened state of alert. Nope, nothing like \""on high alert\"" or anything similar.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? \""Blocking\"" is the key verb, and while it describes a restriction, it doesn't do so in a way that *actively* frames the situation alarmingly.

It's not the verb that's raising the flag here.\n\nSo, the rule for Q3 is: a moderate verb *paired with* significant scale/impact.  I don't see that combination.

But here's the catch: the rule *explicitly* excludes future or hypothetical actions when evaluating for *realized* impact. \""Threatens to spark\"" falls into the future category, so it doesn't meet the definition for Q3. \""Increase\"" is a neutral verb; it doesn't make the cut. \""Soaring\"" is an interesting one, because it is included in the list of moderate verbs.
