{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the term 'rare' to describe the frequency of infections, which is not a risk-adjective as defined for Q1 (e.g., deadly, dangerous, severe), nor is it modified by an intensifier or comparative.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. I'm being asked to assess a text segment against the criteria of Q1 in this 12-step decision tree for claim framing. Specifically, I need to check if the segment contains an intensifier or comparative adjective that *directly* modifies a risk-adjective.\n\nI've got a clear list of risk-adjectives: 'deadly,' 'dangerous,' 'severe,' 'catastrophic,' 'brutal,' 'contagious,' 'virulent,' 'destructive'. And a list of intensifiers and comparatives: 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely,' 'highly,' 'particularly,' 'frighteningly,' 'more,' 'less,' 'deadlier,' 'safer,' 'higher,' 'lower', along with that idiom, \"deadly from the start/outset\".\n\nNow, let's look at the segment: \"Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\"\n\nMy initial thought is to identify any potential risk-adjectives. The only adjective I see is \"rare.\" But, and this is crucial, is \"rare\" a risk-adjective *in the context of Q1*? My understanding is that Q1 focuses on adjectives that describe the inherent *severity* or *contagiousness* of a risk. The examples provided (deadly, dangerous, etc.) seem to confirm this.  \"Rare\" describes the *frequency* or *likelihood* of the event, not the inherent characteristics of the risk itself.\n\nFurthermore, \"rare\" isn't being modified by any of the intensifiers or comparatives I've been given. It's simply stated as being \"considered rare.\"\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding of Q1 and the provided lists, this segment doesn't fit the pattern. It lacks a direct modifier of a risk-adjective as defined by Q1. My conclusion is a firm \"no.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective as defined by Q1. While the segment contains the word 'rare,' 'rare' is not considered a risk-adjective in this context, and is not modified by an intensifier or comparative.\"\n}\n```\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases as defined in Q2.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment for Q2 Cues**\n\nOkay, I've been asked to analyze the following sentence: \"Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\"  My task is to evaluate this against the criteria of Q2 in my decision tree.  Specifically, I'm looking for any signs of alarmist language - high-potency verbs, striking metaphors, superlative nouns combined with negative connotations, or the specific phrase \"on high alert.\"\n\nLet's break this down. First, I scanned for high-potency verbs.  I see \"occur,\" \"are considered,\" and \"said.\"  While these are verbs, they are quite neutral. They don't have the impact of, say, \"decimated,\" \"exploded,\" or \"devastated.\"  No red flags there.\n\nNext, I looked for any potent metaphors that might be creating a sense of urgency or alarm. Nothing. The language is straightforward.\n\nMoving on to superlative + negative nouns - I'm not seeing anything that fits that profile either. No \"worst nightmare,\" \"most perilous threat,\" or similar constructions.\n\nFinally, I checked for the \"on high alert\" phrase, which is a key indicator we're looking for under Q2.  It's simply not there.\n\nThe sentence *does* use the word \"rare\" to describe human infections. However, the descriptor \"rare\" implies a low frequency of the infections which, while it does indicate a small risk, it does not rise to the level of creating an alarmist tone. The source of the descriptor \"rare\" is also attributed to CDC officials which further distances the tone from alarmism. It sounds more like an effort to communicate risk in a clear, straightforward manner. Therefore, it's not a Q2 cue.\n\nSo, based on this evaluation, my answer to Q2 is \"no.\"  I now need to move on to Q3.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with scale/impact information. 'considered rare' describes a low-risk condition.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Alarmist Framing: Q3 Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\" My task is to determine if this triggers Q3 of the decision tree, the \"Alarmist\" frame check. Specifically, Q3 looks for \"moderate verbs\" paired with explicit scale or impact information.\n\nLet's break this down. My initial scan picks up on \"are considered rare.\"  \"Considered\" isn't on the list of flagged \"moderate verbs,\" so that's a key point. Now, \"rare\" *does* describe frequency, which *could* be interpreted as impact, but it's presented as a low-risk fact, a calming factor. If anything, this screams \"Q5 Explicit Calming,\" not Q3.\n\nI'm double-checking the Q3 rules to be sure. The regex uses a very specific list of verbs: *hit, swept, surged, soared, plunged, plummeted, prompted, feared, fearing, were/was culled*.  \"Considered\" isn't there. Furthermore, the examples for Q3 all focus on amplifying negative events or conditions.  We're talking about phrases like *swept across the nation*, *hard hit*, or *feared outbreak*. \"Rare\" is the opposite: it's downplaying the significance.\n\nThe text *explicitly* states a low-risk condition. It uses \"rare\" to minimize the impact. This isn't alarmist, it's the opposite! This goes to Q5, explicit calming, without a doubt. So, based on the specific rules of Q3, and the content of the text, my answer is \"no.\" This does *not* trigger the Q3 Alarmist flag.  The emphasis is on the rarity, not on some negative event being exaggerated. I'd expect this to be evaluated further down the line, specifically at Q5, for the explicit calming effect.\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise. It is a declarative statement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Rhetoric**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and tasked with checking it against Q4, specifically looking for those loaded rhetorical questions designed to induce alarm. My approach is pretty straightforward: first, I'll *really* examine the segment to understand its structure and content. In this case, the segment is: \"Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\"\n\nNext, I need to remind myself what Q4 is actually looking for: a rhetorical question, cleverly worded to make you feel a sense of fear or urgency. Does this segment contain a question, rhetorical or otherwise? Not at all. It's a straight-up declarative statement. That immediately tells me, according to the rule, that it can't possibly contain a *loaded* rhetorical question. \n\nSince there are no questions present, applying Q4 is a simple process of elimination. The answer, therefore, is definitely \"no.\" And to justify this, the rationale is equally straightforward: the segment simply doesn't include any questions to begin with. Time to format that as JSON and move on.\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'considered rare' states a low-risk fact but lacks explicit calming language or an intensifier required for Q5 Reassuring.", "thoughts": "**Evaluation of Text Segment Against Q5**\n\nOkay, so I'm evaluating this segment, \"Human infections do occur... previously said,\" against Q5 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if it contains explicit calming cues that reassure the audience about safety, control, or significantly minimized present risk.\n\nThe key phrase here is \"considered rare.\" My initial thought is that this *seems* reassuring, as it indicates a low frequency of infection. However, I need to be precise. I know from the criteria that a simple low-risk statement isn't enough; it needs to be *amplified* or paired with a calming cue to be considered \"Reassuring\" under Q5.\n\nThe \"Low-Risk Evaluation (+ Intensifier)\" pattern immediately comes to mind. It's similar, but the example provided – \"**risk is *very* low**\" – highlights the critical need for an intensifier. \"Considered rare\" is a low-risk statement, yes, but it lacks that crucial \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or similar term. It doesn't quite fit the pattern.\n\nI then check against other patterns, like \"Direct Safety Assurance\" and \"Confidence Statements.\" None of those patterns match. It's definitely not \"no cause for alarm\" or \"rest assured.\" This is a straightforward statement of a low-risk fact.\n\nThinking about it more broadly, this boils down to a \"bare positive fact\" – a statement of something positive/low-risk. The examples in the table emphasize that bare positive facts are generally Neutral, *unless* they're explicitly framed as a calming cue.\n\nThe fact that \"CDC officials\" said it is a factor, but this does not qualify the segment to contain \"preparedness cues.\"\n\nSince \"considered rare\" is simply a neutral description of frequency/risk and lacks any explicit attempt to reduce worry or emphasize safety through amplification, I must conclude that it *doesn't* meet the criteria for Q5 Reassuring. My answer would be \"no.\"\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text uses 'rare' but lacks both a specific minimiser token ('only', 'just', etc.) and an explicit scale contrast ('out of X'). Q6 requires both elements.", "thoughts": "**Q6 Analysis: Text Evaluation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and tasked with checking if it triggers Rule Q6. Essentially, the question boils down to whether the text attempts to reassure by using a \"minimiser\" combined with a \"scale contrast.\" Let's dissect this.\n\nFirst, I need to look for a minimiser. The text states \"considered rare\". \"Rare\" is certainly an indicator of frequency, but it doesn't qualify as one of the explicit minimiser tokens that the rule specifies ('only,' 'just,' 'merely,' 'a single,' 'few'). The rule is quite specific here, and a bare adjective, like \"rare,\" isn't enough *unless* it's paired with one of those lexical cues.\n\nNext, I need to check for a scale contrast. The text does say that \"Human infections\" are \"rare,\" which implies a low frequency. However, it doesn't provide the type of explicit contrast I'm looking for - something like \"rare compared to the total number of contacts\" or \"only a few cases among thousands of exposures\". The text relies solely on the inherent implication of \"rare\".\n\nTo satisfy Q6, *both* a specific minimiser *and* an explicit scale contrast are required. Since this text is missing *both* the explicit minimiser and the explicit scale, and the rule explicitly states that if either one is missing, the rule isn't triggered, the answer to Q6 is a definitive \"no\". The rationale here is simple: while \"rare\" implies a low frequency, it's not the required minimiser token, and there is no explicit scale contrast.\n"}
