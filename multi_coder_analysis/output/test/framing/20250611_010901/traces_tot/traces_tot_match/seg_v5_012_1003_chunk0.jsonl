{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective as defined by Q1."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a lack of concern ('do not present an immediate public health concern') and does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlatives, or critical alert phrases listed in Q2."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the verb 'present' which is not on the list of moderate verbs for Q3, and it describes a lack of concern, not scale/impact."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement ('The cases do not present...') and does not contain a question, loaded or otherwise."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statement 'do not present an immediate public health concern' is a bare negation about the absence of a negative condition, lacking explicit calming amplification required for Q5. This matches the Q5 exclusion example."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states the cases 'do not present an immediate public health concern' but does not use a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) in conjunction with a scale contrast ('out of X', 'among Y') to downplay the event's significance."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'do not present an immediate public health concern' is a bare negation without explicit calming."}
