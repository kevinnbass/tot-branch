{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains the risk-adjective 'deadly', but it is not modified by an intensifier or comparative adjective as required by Q1."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'threatens to spark' and mentions 'soaring inflation'. 'Threatens to spark' is not listed as a high-potency verb/metaphor. 'Soaring' modifying 'inflation' is explicitly ignored as it describes a background condition, not the threat's direct impact."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text does not contain a moderate verb from the specified list paired with information detailing significant scale or impact of the threat's realised impact. 'Soaring inflation' is a background condition."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains statements, not questions. There are no loaded rhetorical questions present."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statement 'does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked' is a bare negation/positive fact under a condition, lacking explicit calming language like 'no cause for alarm' or 'public can rest easy' required for Q5."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a 'minimiser' (only, just, merely, a single, few) combined with an explicit 'scale contrast' (out of X, among Y) to downplay an event for reassurance."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'does not present a food safety risk' is a bare negation without an explicit calming cue."}
