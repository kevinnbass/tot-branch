### QUICK DECISION CHECK
• Describes CAPABILITY / PREPAREDNESS (**PREPARED / PLAN / SYSTEM / PROTOCOL / RESOURCES / STOCKPILED / DEVELOPED**) **AND** no calming keyword (**SAFE / REST EASY / UNDER CONTROL / ALARM**) within 40 tokens?  
• If the sentence already fires Q5 "Transient‑Issue Minimiser"  
  (e.g. contains "short‑term blip", "resolve quickly"), **skip Q8**.
→ If yes → `"yes"` (Neutral); else → `"no"`.

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: The agency has developed a rapid deployment plan for emergencies.
## Question: Does the segment describe capabilities/preparedness without active reassurance?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"States capability factually without explicitly linking to current calm or present safety."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: The agency's plan is a game-changer, meaning the public can rest assured help will arrive swiftly.
## Question: Does the segment describe capabilities/preparedness without active reassurance?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'game-changer' and 'public can rest assured' actively link capability to present reassurance."}

### Question Q8
**Rule C FAST‑PATH** – If the sentence merely states a capability/preparedness measure **and** does *not* contain an explicit calming keyword (`safe`, `alarm`, `no danger`, `rest easy`, `under control`) inside 40 tokens, answer "yes" → Neutral **immediately**.

**Q8: Capability/Preparedness Statement without Active Reassurance (Rule C Test)**
Does the segment describe capabilities, preparedness measures, hopeful future possibilities, or implemented safeguards (e.g., 'officials are working to contain,' 'vaccine can be made in X weeks,' 'systems are in place') WITHOUT the author or quoted source explicitly and actively linking these to a state of *current* calm, *present* safety, or *substantially minimized present risk* for the audience, as detailed in Rule C and related guidance?

**🔍 Q8 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Neutral** |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Development Capabilities** | "vaccine can be made in X weeks," "researchers are developing treatments," "antiviral stockpiled" | ✓ |
| **Response Measures** | "officials are working to contain," "systems are in place," "protocols are being followed" | ✓ |
| **Preparedness Statements** | "we have the resources," "plans are ready," "surveillance is ongoing" | ✓ |
| **Future Possibilities** | "restrictions may be short-lived," "situation could improve," "recovery expected" | ✓ |
| **Capability + Active Reassurance** | "stockpiled 30M doses, which is excellent news and means citizens are very well protected," "systems in place, so public can rest easy" | → Reassuring |

**Guard 2 – speaker test**    
If the capability statement comes from **industry PR** (companies, lobby groups) rather than **public authorities**, treat it as Neutral unless calming keywords appear.

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Neutral. No → Proceed to Q9.
