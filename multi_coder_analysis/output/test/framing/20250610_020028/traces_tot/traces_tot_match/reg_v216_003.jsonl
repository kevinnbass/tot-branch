{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'highly pathogenic' is part of the technical name 'highly pathogenic avian flu' and is explicitly excluded as an Alarmist cue under Q1 rules.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm evaluating this text segment, \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu,\" against Question 1 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if it uses an intensifier or comparative adjective to modify a risk adjective in an alarmist way.\n\nI immediately see the phrase \"highly pathogenic.\" Now, based on the specific rules, I know that if \"highly pathogenic\" is used *as part of* the formal disease name, HPAI, it's considered neutral, unless there are *other* alarming cues. The regex even has a negative lookahead to exclude precisely this situation!\n\nIn this sentence, \"highly pathogenic\" is clearly part of the technical name for the specific strain of avian flu. It's not being used to amp up a general risk like \"deadly\" or \"dangerous\" the way an intensifier would. It's simply a descriptive term within the scientific nomenclature.\n\nTherefore, Q1 isn't triggered here. The segment doesn't contain an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk adjective in an alarmist manner. My answer is a firm \"no.\""}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'infected' is a neutral, factual description, not a high-potency verb or potent metaphor as defined for Q2.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Analyzing for Alarmist Framing (Q2)**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess this text snippet – \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu\" – against Q2 of the decision tree. That means I need to zero in on any alarmist language: potent verbs or metaphors that are actively framing the situation in a scary way.\n\nMy focus is on language that goes beyond simple reporting. I'm looking for verbs like 'ravaged', 'devastated', or imagery like 'ticking time bomb'. Things that really amplify the perceived severity.\n\nIn this case, the main verb is \"were infected.\"  That's a pretty factual, technical description, isn't it? It just states a biological state. While \"highly pathogenic avian flu\" *describes* a serious virus, the verb itself (\"infected\") is neutral in its presentation. It's a key principle: the focus is on the *presentation*, not just the severity of the facts themselves. A severe fact presented neutrally is coded as neutral.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I have to conclude that this segment *doesn't* contain the kind of alarmist framing that Q2 is looking for. My answer is \"no\". Now, according to the decision tree, I need to move on to the next question, Q3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"q2_answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment does not contain a high-potency verb or potent metaphor that actively frames the situation alarmingly. The verb 'were infected' is a factual description of the chickens' state, and while 'highly pathogenic avian flu' describes a severe virus, the verb is neutral in its presentation. A severe fact presented factually is Neutral.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'were infected' is not on the list of moderate verbs for Q3, nor is it paired with scale/impact information.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of Question Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and I need to determine if it aligns with Question Q3 of the decision tree. Q3 is looking for two things: a \"moderate verb\" from a specific list, *and* information about the \"significant scale or impact\" of whatever that verb describes.\n\nLet's break down the text: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\"  The verb here is \"were infected.\"  I immediately check my mental list of moderate verbs and I realize \"infected\" isn't on it.  We're looking for verbs like \"hit,\" \"swept,\" or \"culled.\"  In fact, the rule *explicitly* excludes words like \"affected,\" and \"infected\" is essentially the same kind of plain outcome verb. Even if it *were* a moderate verb, there's no scale or impact information like \"millions affected\" or \"caused record losses\" anywhere in that sentence. It just says they were infected.\n\nTo satisfy Q3, I need *both* conditions: the approved verb *and* the scale/impact detail.  Since \"infected\" isn't an approved verb, the condition for Q3 is not met. It's a clear \"no\" to this question. Therefore, I'll provide a JSON object with the \"answer\" as \"no\" and the \"rationale\" explaining that \"infected\" is not on the list of approved moderate verbs, and there's no information about the significant scale or impact. It's really that straightforward."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain a question.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\" My task is to analyze this against the criteria of Q4 in the decision tree. Q4, as I recall, is looking for *loaded rhetorical questions* designed to evoke alarm.\n\nFirst, I read the segment. Then, I quickly re-familiarize myself with what Q4 is explicitly searching for: a loaded rhetorical question. This implies a question that carries an emotional charge or suggests a specific conclusion without explicitly stating it.\n\nStraight away, I see this is a declarative statement, a simple assertion of fact. It's not a question at all. There's no interrogative sentence structure, no implied question, no attempt to steer the reader toward a specific emotional response. Therefore, it definitely doesn't contain a *loaded rhetorical* question.\n\nThe answer to Q4 is, quite plainly, \"no\". The rationale I'll give is straightforward: the text segment does not contain a question. I'll construct the JSON response with that answer and a clear, concise justification."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (infection in chickens) using factual language but contains no explicit calming cues or language designed to reassure the audience about current safety or control.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Against Q5**\n\nOkay, I've been tasked with analyzing this sentence, \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu,\" through the lens of Q5. This is the crucial question about explicit calming cues - does this language suggest the situation is currently safe, under control, or that risk is minimized? \n\nLet's break it down: \"Broiler chickens were infected...\"  This is just a factual statement about an infection. \"With the same H5N1 strain...\" This identifies the specific strain of the virus, a detail necessary for understanding the context, but not reassuring in itself. \"...of highly pathogenic avian flu.\"  And here we're told it's a *highly* pathogenic strain, the exact opposite of a reassuring message!\n\nI'm looking for phrases like \"don't worry,\" \"it's all fine,\" or some statement of control.  I'm also aware of that regex pattern as a tool. But, simply put, there's nothing here that fits the bill. The text is reporting a negative event, and using scientific language to do so. It doesn't contain a hint of reassurance, like \"no cause for alarm,\" nor any claim that the situation is under control. Therefore, the answer to Q5 is a definitive \"no\". Now, on to Q6... oh wait, just Q5. Okay."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser word combined with a scale contrast.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Reassurance through Minimiser and Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and need to assess it against the decision tree's Q6. That means I'm looking for evidence of \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" used as a reassurance tactic. This is crucial for understanding the nuances of how information is presented.\n\nThe segment itself is pretty straightforward: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\"  My immediate task is to break it down and see if those two key elements are present.\n\nFirst, I looked for minimisers - words like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"a few.\" I scanned the sentence: \"Broiler chickens were infected... same H5N1... avian flu.\" Nope, nothing like that. No attempt to downplay or restrict the scope of the infection with a limiting qualifier.\n\nNext, I looked for an explicit or implied scale contrast. I needed something that would set this infection in a broader context - \"out of thousands,\" \"among millions,\" \"nationwide,\" you know the drill.  Again, I combed the text. Nothing! There's no attempt to contextualize the infection within a larger framework, either positive or negative.\n\nIt's a straightforward factual statement. No reassurance tactics here.  Therefore, my answer to Q6 is a definitive \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the required pattern of minimiser plus scale contrast is simply not present in this text. It's a clear case of information delivery without any added persuasive element."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a fact about infection and does not contain any form of negation.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Bare Negation in the Avian Flu Segment**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess the phrase \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu\" against the Q7 rule, which focuses on identifying 'bare negation'.  My thought process is pretty straightforward here. First, I need to understand what the segment is actually saying: it's a statement of fact about chickens being infected with a particular flu strain.\n\nNext, I have to *literally* scan the text for any negative words. I'm looking for \"not,\" \"no,\" \"unlikely,\" anything that negates the statement.  Nope, there's nothing there.\n\nSince Q7 is all about 'bare negation', and there's *no* negation present, it's pretty clear cut. The segment doesn't fit the pattern. The answer to Q7 is a definite \"no.\"\n\nTo wrap it up, the rationale is simple: the segment doesn't contain any negation. It's a positive statement about the chickens' infection."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes an infection event and the nature of the virus, not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Question Q8**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\" and need to see if it fits Question Q8 of the decision tree. Q8 asks if this is a statement about capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards *without* explicitly linking them to present safety or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is that this is a straightforward statement of fact.  It's reporting a past event: chickens were infected. It also specifies a characteristic of the virus, that it's highly pathogenic. But that's it.\n\nI'm checking: does this describe capabilities, like a research team being able to do something? No. Is it about preparedness, like having a good surveillance system in place? Definitely not. Is it presenting hopeful future possibilities? Not at all. Is it mentioning implemented safeguards?  No, it's just stating a past event.\n\nSince this segment doesn't touch on any of those things – capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards – it can't be a \"Capability/Preparedness Statement without Active Reassurance.\" The fact that it's *not* any of those things means the answer to Q8 is clearly \"no.\"  I'll need to move on to the next question in the decision tree (Q9), but for now, I'm done with Q8."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports on a health/disease issue (avian flu infection), not prices, economic data, or numerical metrics as defined by Q9.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Decision Tree Q9**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\" My task is to determine if this aligns with Q9 of the decision tree. Q9, as I understand it, is looking for segments that *primarily* report prices, economic data, or numerical metrics, using a specific set of neutral language.\n\nFrom my perspective as an expert, this segment immediately stands out. It's clearly dealing with a health and disease issue: avian flu in chickens. It's describing a biological event—the infection. There's no hint of prices, economic indicators, or numerical metrics being the *focus* of this statement. The language is descriptive, but it's focused on the *event* itself, not the economic ramifications or price points.\n\nTherefore, applying my expertise, I have to conclude this segment does *not* fit the criteria for Q9. My answer, unequivocally, is \"no.\" My rationale would emphasize that the segment is not reporting economic or price-related information; it's describing a biological phenomenon."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a past event (chickens were infected) and does not contain language speculating about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Q10 Evaluation - A Neutral Stance**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to evaluate against Question Q10 of the decision tree. Q10's the one about looking for speculation on future relief or improvement without a calming cue. My initial read of the segment \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu\" suggests it's pretty straightforward, but I need to be precise.\n\nLet's break it down. Does it speculate about the future? Absolutely not. It's a statement of fact about a past event.  There's no talk of *potential* for things to get better, no hints of future relief.  I'm not seeing any modal verbs like \"could\" or \"might\" that hint at possibility, and there's no predictive language like \"expect\" or \"hope.\" It's just a simple declaration of what *was*, not what *could be*.\n\nTherefore, based on my expert understanding and a close reading of the text, my answer to Q10 is a definitive \"no.\"  Since the answer is \"no,\" I'll move on to the next stage in the process. I'll need to remember to articulate this rationale clearly in the JSON output, documenting the absence of speculative language that would trigger a \"yes\" response to Q10."}

That's the one looking for a dominant frame provided by a direct quote. Let's break this down:\n\nFirst, I need to *thoroughly* analyze the segment itself. Right off the bat, I see no text that's enclosed in quotation marks, nothing like \"Researchers say...\" or anything clearly attributed to a specific source.\n\nSince Q11 specifically focuses on *directly quoted* sources providing the frame, and there are *no* direct quotes here, I can immediately conclude that this segment does *not* satisfy the conditions of Q11.\n\nTherefore, the answer has to be \"no.\" Now, I just need to solidify that in the rationale. I need to clearly state the absence of direct quotations as the primary reason for my answer.\n\nFinally, I'll package all this into a clean JSON object with the \"answer\" and the \"rationale\". Easy peasy."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Reports infection with a technically described virus strain using factual, descriptive language without added alarmist or reassuring rhetoric.", "thoughts": "**Framing Analysis Summary**\n\nI've reached Q12 in the 12-step decision tree, evaluating the segment: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\"  My analysis focuses on whether this segment presents a neutral frame by default.\n\nI see no Alarmist framing cues: no intensifiers, vivid verbs, or scale exaggerations. While \"highly pathogenic\" might seem alarmist, it functions as a technical descriptor of the virus itself, part of its official classification, not an authorial attempt to amplify the impact of the infection.  The \"Context Guard\" for vivid language supports this interpretation, as \"highly pathogenic\" describes a background condition (the virus strain), not the specific event being reported. There are no Reassuring cues present either.\n\nThe segment is a factual and descriptive statement: chickens were infected with a specific virus strain.  There's no additional rhetoric pushing it towards an alarmist or reassuring frame.  Therefore, Q12 is answered affirmatively. The frame is **Neutral**.\n```json\n{\n  \"frame\": \"Neutral\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment reports a negative fact (infection with a highly pathogenic virus) using factual, descriptive language.
