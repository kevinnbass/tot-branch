{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes an outbreak and its impact using neutral language, without intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Segment Against Q1 of the Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, so I need to analyze this text segment, specifically looking at whether it aligns with the criteria for Q1 of the 12-step decision tree for claim framing. That first question, I remember, is all about spotting intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly modifying risk-related adjectives.  Essentially, are we seeing phrases like \"so dangerous,\" \"very severe,\" or anything along those lines?\n\nThe segment in question is: \"In 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\"  Let's break this down. \"In 2015\" is just a timeframe, nothing interesting there.  \"A bird flu outbreak\" describes the event itself, but no qualifying adjectives yet. The list of states is simply location information.  And finally, \"impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat\" – this describes the consequence. It's all very factual so far.\n\nI'm specifically looking for those intensifiers or comparative adjectives paired with words that describe risk, severity, or danger.  I'm not seeing any. There are no \"deadly\" outbreaks, \"dangerous\" consequences, or \"severe\" impacts being described.  Even if there were, they wouldn't be modified by an intensifier.\n\nTherefore, after a careful review, the segment definitively does *not* satisfy the conditions of Q1.  The language is factual and neutral.  My answer to Q1 is a firm \"no,\" and my rationale will be that the segment fails to exhibit the required pattern of intensifiers or comparative adjectives modifying risk-related adjectives. It's a clear-cut case."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'impacted' is a moderate verb and does not meet the criteria for a high-potency verb, potent metaphor, or other Q2 patterns.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Claim Framing: Q2 Evaluation**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess this text snippet – \"In 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\" – against Q2 of the 12-step decision tree for claim framing. The task is pretty straightforward: look for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative/negative noun combinations, or the phrase \"on high alert.\"  Essentially, I'm hunting for the \"alarmist\" language that could signal a specific framing.\n\nMy initial scan focuses on those key indicators. The verb is \"impacted.\"  Immediately, I compare that to the pre-defined list of high-potency verbs I'm using: verbs like \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" \"skyrocketed,\" etc.  \"Impacted\" just doesn't belong in that category. It's too mild. Then, I look for superlative + negative nouns, potent metaphors, or the specific \"on high alert\" phrase.  Nothing. Nada. Zip.\n\nSince \"impacted\" isn't a high-potency verb, and none of the other Q2 patterns are present, the answer to Q2 is unequivocally \"no.\" The rule-based system is clear: a moderate verb like \"impacted,\" on its own, triggers a \"Neutral\" response at this stage (according to the Q2 Pattern Recognition Table and Boundary guard). I need to now move on to Q3 to further evaluate, although that's not the task for this particular turn."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'impacted' is not on the list of moderate verbs that trigger Q3.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Decision: Analyzing the Claim**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment: \"In 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\" My task is to see if this passes Q3 of the claim framing decision tree. That means I need to check for a \"moderate verb\" describing \"significant scale or impact.\"\n\nFirst, I identified the segment. Then, I scanned it for verbs that fall into the \"moderate verb\" category.  I'm using the regex `\\b(hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|culled|feared|fearing)\\b` for this. The segment *does* contain a verb, \"impacted.\"\n\nNow, this is where the precision of this process comes into play. I know from my experience that even similar verbs can have different connotations. I went directly to the established criteria. And the criteria explicitly state that \"impacted\" is *not* on the approved list for Q3.  It's similar to \"affected\", and that's the key.\n\nTherefore, because \"impacted\" isn't one of the pre-approved moderate verbs, the condition for Q3 isn't met. The answer to Q3 is \"no.\"\n\nMy rationale is simple and direct: The verb \"impacted\" is not included in the list of moderate verbs used for evaluating Q3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The verb 'impacted' is not on the list of approved moderate verbs for Q3 (hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|culled|feared|fearing).\"\n}\n```"}

It details a specific event—a bird flu outbreak in 2015—and its documented consequence on production. There's no questioning here, no subtle attempts to manipulate the reader's emotions through phrasing. It's a straightforward description of a historical occurrence.\n\nGiven this objective assessment, Q4's criteria aren't met. There are no rhetorical questions, loaded or otherwise, designed to create a sense of alarm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is unequivocally \"no.\"\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The text segment is a factual statement and does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise, that are designed to imply alarm, as defined by Q4.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a past event (bird flu outbreak and its impact) factually without any explicit language from the author or a source intended to calm concerns, minimize risk, or assure safety/control.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, I've been given this text and I need to determine if it explicitly reassures the reader, specifically looking for language that falls into the Q5 pattern recognition parameters. I understand the goal: identify if this segment contains any phraseology that's intended to calm anxieties about the stated bird flu outbreak.\n\nI've reviewed the segment, \"In 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\" My assessment is that this is simply a factual report of an event and its consequence. I'm not seeing any of the tell-tale signs: no attempts to diminish the situation, minimize the risk, or convey a sense of control. There's no \"no cause for alarm\" or any similar reassuring language.\n\nGiven my analysis, I confidently conclude that the segment does *not* contain an explicit calming cue for reassurance. I will answer \"no\" to Q5."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser word ('only', 'just', etc.) combined with a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'among millions').", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Minimizer + Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to assess this text segment against Question 6 of this decision tree, which is all about spotting \"Minimizer + Scale Contrast\" used for reassurance.  Let's see, the segment is: \"In 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\"\n\nMy first instinct, given my experience, is to immediately scan for those key indicators. I'm looking for a minimizer word - think \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely\" - anything that downplays the scope or impact.  Then, I'm checking for a contrasting scale, a larger context to put the affected area into perspective. Something like \"out of the entire country\" or \"amongst hundreds of farms.\"\n\nFirst pass... no minimizers. Nothing like \"just a few states.\" The text simply states which states were impacted.\n\nSecond pass... no scale contrast.  It mentions multiple states, but doesn't *contrast* that number with a larger population or area. It doesn't say \"only five states\" in comparison to some other larger number like all states.\n\nGiven that neither the minimizer nor the contrast are present, as far as I can see, I'm confident in saying the answer to Q6 is \"no.\" I'll construct the JSON output as specified."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a past event and its impact; it does not contain any form of bare negation or statement denying a risk.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Bare Negation in the Provided Text**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with a text segment: \"In 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\" The task is to determine whether this snippet triggers Q7 in the decision tree. Q7, as I understand it, is looking for a \"bare negation\" – a denial or downplaying of a risk or problem *without* an accompanying calming cue.\n\nMy initial assessment is straightforward. The segment describes a past event, specifically the economic impact of a bird flu outbreak. It notes the impact (\"impacted the production\"), which clearly indicates an adverse effect. It’s a statement of fact, a historical description. There's no negation whatsoever. I see no \"not,\" no \"no,\" no \"unlikely,\" or any other negating term that would deny or minimize the seriousness of the situation. It’s simply a statement about what happened.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that this segment *does not* contain a bare negation. My answer to Q7, then, is \"no.\" This means, according to the instructions, that I would move on to the next question, Q8, but the user only needs the answer to Q7. So, the JSON response, confirming my evaluation, will be as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"q7\": \"no\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The segment describes an event that had an impact. It does not contain any negating terms that deny or downplay a risk or problem.\"\n}\n```"}

Q8 is looking for descriptions of capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, *but* without tying them to a sense of current calm or reduced risk.\n\nMy initial thought is that this segment doesn't fit the mold at all. It's a straightforward historical statement, detailing a past outbreak and its specific economic impact. I immediately recognize that it's a description of a past event, not a statement about future potential, or current capacity, or safeguards put in place, which is what Q8 is looking for.\n\nLet's break it down to be sure. Does it mention any capabilities? Nope. Preparedness measures? Not in the slightest. Hopeful future possibilities? Absolutely not. Implemented safeguards? Definitely not. It's simply stating *what happened* and *the consequences.*\n\nTherefore, this isn't a \"Capability/Preparedness Statement without Active Reassurance\". It's a historical fact. Thus, the answer to Q8 is definitively \"no\". I should move to the next question, but my job here is done."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a consequence ('impacted production') but does not report specific prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs like 'rose' or 'declined'.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Against Q9 Criteria**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with assessing this text against the decision tree's Q9. The text segment is: \"In 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\" My immediate thought is, does this constitute factual reporting of prices, economic data, or metrics?\n\nI'm thinking, \"Let's break it down.\" The segment talks about a bird flu outbreak in specific states and then says it \"impacted\" production of table eggs and turkey meat. While it *mentions* production, which is related to economics, it doesn't actually present any specific data or numbers. I don't see any prices, percentages, or concrete metrics, which is what Q9 is primarily looking for. I mean, where are the \"production decreased by X%\" or \"prices rose by Y%\" figures?\n\nThen I consider the verb \"impacted.\" Is that a standard, neutral verb typically used when reporting economic data? In my experience, no. It's more general. I'm used to seeing verbs like \"rose,\" \"fell,\" \"increased,\" or \"declined\" when working with data. \"Impacted\" suggests a negative consequence, but it's not a precise economic term. There's no vivid language, no \"skyrocketed\" or \"plummeted,\" and definitely no risk adjectives or framing that I'd associate with an economic report.\n\nUltimately, I'm concluding that this segment *describes* a consequence of an event, but it doesn't actually *present* economic data in the way Q9 defines. Q9 is looking for the precise reporting of prices or metrics, and this is more of a factual statement about what *happened* as a result of the outbreak. Therefore, the answer to Q9 is \"no,\" and I should proceed to Q10."}

Q10's the one that's looking for speculation about *future* relief or improvement, but without any explicit calming cues. My expert intuition is immediately keying in on that key word: *future*.\n\nNow, the text is about a bird flu outbreak in 2015 and its impact on egg and turkey production.  From my understanding of the relevant fields, the language used is pretty straightforward: it's a historical account, a description of something that *already happened*. There's no hint of \"what ifs\" or predictions of things getting better or worse. I'm not seeing any speculative language about the future, no mention of potential recovery, new treatments, or any kind of anticipation of positive change.\n\nTherefore, given the explicit criteria of Q10, I can confidently answer \"no\".  This segment doesn't fit the bill. The analysis is complete."}

Nope, I don't see any quotation marks in the text: \"In 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\" So, strike one.\n\nNext, I need to look for attributed statements, where someone, a specific source, is quoted indirectly or their opinion is being relayed. While it discusses the impact of a bird flu outbreak, there isn't a named individual, organization, or source whose statement or perspective is being presented. It's just a statement of fact about the impact.\n\nGiven that I didn't find any direct quotes or attributed statements, the answer to Q11 is definitively \"no\".  Based on this \"no\" I will proceed to the next hop in the decision tree, which is Q12."}

Now, I need to make a final call based on whether any clear framing remains.\n\nHere's the breakdown of my thinking:\n\nFirst, I examine the provided segment: \"In 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\" I observe that it's a straightforward reporting of an event: a bird flu outbreak. There is no language to amplify or downplay the impact. The segment uses words like \"outbreak\" and \"impacted\" to describe what happened. I'll evaluate the specifics:\n\n*   \"bird flu outbreak\" - simply a statement of what occurred; while the word 'outbreak' *could* be alarmist, here it's simply descriptive.\n*   \"impacted the production\" - this is also factual. The word \"impacted\" isn't overly dramatic.\n*   The segment states locations and the year.\n\nGiven that I've already checked for Alarmist and Reassuring cues in the prior eleven questions, I consider whether this segment contains *any* such cues. I note that it does not. The language is purely factual, and the reported information is descriptive. There's no attempt to intensify the event or use positive language to calm any potential reader. The segment reports negative facts, but without any specific framing.\n\nAs a result of this analysis, I determine that this segment conforms to the characteristics of a Neutral frame."}
