{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'so' modifying the risk-adjective 'infectious'.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segments for Alarmist Framing Cues**\n\nMy task was to act as an expert claim-framing coder, assessing each text segment for alarmist language. Specifically, I focused on identifying instances where an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifies a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\" - as per the first question of a 12-step decision tree (Q1).\n\nI meticulously examined each segment, applying the provided rules, definitions, and the Q1 regex pattern.  The critical \"technical-term guard\" was applied to avoid misclassifying segments that mentioned terms like \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\" as alarmist, as the presence of a technical term, itself, does not indicate an alarmist frame.\n\nMy analysis led to the following results:\n\n*   **Segments 1-7, 9-11, 13-17, 19-23, 25-27, 29, 30:** No instances of intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives were found. The presence of risk adjectives like \"rare,\" \"deadly\" (in the singular, not intensified, form), or other potentially negative terms was carefully evaluated against the rule's criteria. Segments were categorized as \"no\" based on the specific requirements of Q1 and the detailed explanations in the guidance.\n*   **Segment 8:** The expression \"very low\" was deemed a reassuring cue, relevant to other frames (Q4, reassurance), not an alarmist cue per Q1.\n*   **Segment 28:** This segment triggered a \"yes\" response to Q1 due to the phrase \"**so infectious**.\" The regex pattern, combined with the presence of an intensifier (\"so\") and the risk adjective \"infectious,\" led to the classification as Alarmist.\n\nBased on this analysis, the requested JSON output would be generated.\n"}
