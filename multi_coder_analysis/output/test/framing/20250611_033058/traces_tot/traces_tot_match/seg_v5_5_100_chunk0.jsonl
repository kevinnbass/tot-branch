{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segments for Alarmist Framing Cues**\n\nMy task was to act as an expert claim-framing coder, assessing each text segment for alarmist language. Specifically, I focused on identifying instances where an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifies a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\" - as per the first question of a 12-step decision tree (Q1).\n\nI meticulously examined each segment, applying the provided rules, definitions, and the Q1 regex pattern.  The critical \"technical-term guard\" was applied to avoid misclassifying segments that mentioned terms like \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\" as alarmist, as the presence of a technical term, itself, does not indicate an alarmist frame.\n\nMy analysis led to the following results:\n\n*   **Segments 1-7, 9-11, 13-17, 19-23, 25-27, 29, 30:** No instances of intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives were found. The presence of risk adjectives like \"rare,\" \"deadly\" (in the singular, not intensified, form), or other potentially negative terms was carefully evaluated against the rule's criteria. Segments were categorized as \"no\" based on the specific requirements of Q1 and the detailed explanations in the guidance.\n*   **Segment 8:** The expression \"very low\" was deemed a reassuring cue, relevant to other frames (Q4, reassurance), not an alarmist cue per Q1.\n*   **Segment 28:** This segment triggered a \"yes\" response to Q1 due to the phrase \"**so infectious**.\" The regex pattern, combined with the presence of an intensifier (\"so\") and the risk adjective \"infectious,\" led to the classification as Alarmist.\n\nBased on this analysis, the requested JSON output would be generated.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('do not present') and does not contain high-potency verbs, metaphors, superlatives, or critical alert phrases.

My goal is to flag any segment that uses language suggesting alarmism. I'm focusing on those high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or the \"on high alert\" phrase with a nearby threat word.\n\nI've carefully reviewed each segment, and my conclusion is that *none* of them trigger the Alarmist frame at this stage. I've been meticulous, looking for those key indicators. Verbs like \"occur,\" \"responsible,\" \"cull,\" \"contract,\" \"spread,\" and \"killed\" are present, but based on the provided definition and regex, none are high-potency enough to trigger Q2. The descriptions are primarily factual or technical. I've checked for any use of alarming metaphors or the \"on high alert\" phrase, but they are not present either.  \"Threatens\" and \"hitting\" were close calls, but did not match the required criteria.\n\nTherefore, for all segments, my initial \"answer\" at Q2 is \"no.\" I'm not seeing any language that significantly heightens the alarm at this stage.\n"}

My analysis adhered strictly to the established guidelines: the Bedrock Principle, Symmetry Rule, Context Guard, Precedence Ladder, and the Mandatory Step-by-Step Decision Process.\n\nAfter a thorough examination of each segment against the Q4 criteria, I determined that **none** of the segments contained a loaded rhetorical question intended to imply alarm. My response for each segment was, therefore, \"no.\" A rationale was not required as the answer was never \"yes.\" This result was rendered as a JSON array, as per the specifications.\n"}

{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "No minimiser + scale contrast pattern found.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Reassurance Cue: \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" (Q6)**\n\nMy task was to act as a claim-framing expert, evaluating 27 text segments for the presence of a specific reassurance pattern: a minimiser word paired with a contrasting larger scale. I focused on whether each segment contained a word like \"only\" or \"just\" (the minimiser) *and* presented that number against a broader context (e.g., \"among millions\"). My expertise was needed to precisely apply the defined criteria and provide a clear rationale for each decision.\n\nFor each segment, I meticulously examined it against the following parameters:\n\n1.  **Minimiser Detection:** I searched for key minimiser words: \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few.\"\n2.  **Scale Context:** I looked for an explicit or strongly implied contrasting scale or context that put the minimised number in perspective (e.g., \"among thousands\").\n3.  **Reassurance Check:** Did the combination of minimiser and scale create a reassuring tone, downplaying the significance of the event?\n4.  **Bare Numerals:** A standalone numeral (like \"1\" or \"one\") didn't qualify as a minimiser.\n\nIf all three elements were present, the answer was \"yes,\" and I'd provide an explanation. If *any* element was absent, the answer was \"no.\"\n\nI systematically went through each segment, making sure to apply the above four steps with precision. The analysis consistently led me to the conclusion that none of the segments contained the pattern I was seeking. In many cases, a number was present (like \"25,000 turkeys\") but wasn't introduced using a minimiser. In other cases, a scale or context was present but without the crucial minimiser. \"Rare\" was also present as a form of quantification in a couple of segments; however, this word itself is not a minimizer token.\n\nThe core reason for each \"no\" was that the \"minimiser + scale contrast\" pattern wasn't present.

My goal is to identify instances of \"bare negation\" without the presence of explicit calming cues. This involves carefully examining each segment for key phrases like \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" or \"no evidence,\" and confirming that no reassuring language mitigates the negation.\n\nHere's how I broke it down, segment by segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** This segment mentions that human infection is \"rare\". While it highlights a low-risk fact, it doesn't contain a negation. Therefore, the answer is \"no\".\n*   **Segment 2:** Bingo! This one contains a clear \"no record of Americans contracting,\" which I recognize as an \"Evidence Negation\" as it references a lack of records or knowledge of a public health event. There are no explicit calming cues here. **Rationale: Contains \"no record of\" which is a bare negation.** The answer is \"yes.\"\n*   **Segment 3-7 & 9-20, 23-26:** These segments do not contain any negation relevant to Q7, so the answer is \"no\" for all of them.\n*   **Segment 8:** This segment includes \"does not present a food safety risk.\" It's a \"Risk Negation\", and there are no calming cues. **Rationale: Contains \"does not present\" which is a bare negation.** The answer is \"yes.\"\n*   **Segment 11:** This has \"do not present an immediate public health concern.\" This is a textbook example of a \"bare negation\" mentioned in the question instructions, and there's no soothing language. **Rationale: Contains \"do not present\" which is a bare negation.** The answer is \"yes.\"\n*   **Segment 21:** The segment highlights that infections are \"considered rare.\" This is a risk-assessment fact and not a direct negation, so it's \"no\".\n*   **Segment 22:** \"No Americans are recorded to have contracted\" is another clear example of an \"Evidence Negation\". No soothing language is present, so the answer is \"yes.\" **Rationale: Contains \"No ... recorded\" which is a bare negation.**\n*   **Segment 27:**  This has \"do not present an immediate public health concern.\" It is also the bare negation mentioned in the question instructions, which is present here. No calming cues. **Rationale: Contains \"do not present\" which is a bare negation.** The answer is \"yes.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the segments that meet the criteria for a \"yes\" answer are 2, 8, 11, 22, and 27. All other segments do not feature bare negations, so they are marked \"no\". Now, I must package this into a JSON format with each segment's ID, answer, and rationale.\n"}
