102,seg_v5_1_102_chunk0,"Bird flu has infected two more farms in Iowa, forcing the killing of 5.3 million hens and 88,000 turkeys, officials said Friday."
102,seg_v5_2_102_chunk0,"The new cases mean that across the nation, farmers have had to kill about 22 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens but also including 1.8 million broiler chickens, 1.9 million pullet and other commercial chickens, and 1.9 million turkeys."
102,seg_v5_3_102_chunk0,"Iowa accounts for many of those cases, with operations having to kill about 13 million chickens and 305,000 turkeys since the outbreaks began a month ago."
102,seg_v5_4_102_chunk0,"Iowa is the nation’s leading egg producer and had 46 million chickens on farms in February, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data."
102,seg_v5_5_102_chunk0,Iowa raises about 11.7 million turkeys annually.
102,seg_v5_6_102_chunk0,"The latest cases were at an egg farm in Osceola County and a turkey farm in Cherokee County, both in northwest Iowa."
102,seg_v5_7_102_chunk0,"Earlier this week, state officials also confirmed the virus on a turkey farm with 35,500 birds in Buena Vista County."
102,seg_v5_8_102_chunk0,"Because the virus is so infectious and deadly for commercial poultry, entire flocks are destroyed and composted on the farms when they [entire flocks] are infected."
102,seg_v5_9_102_chunk0,USDA data shows 23 states have confirmed cases in commercial or backyard flocks.
102,seg_v5_10_102_chunk0,"Spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings or nasal discharge of infected wild birds, such as ducks and geese, which can contaminate dust and soil."
102,seg_v5_11_102_chunk0,"Infected wild birds have been found in at least 26 states, and the virus has been circulating in migrating waterfowl in Europe and Asia for nearly a year."
102,seg_v5_12_102_chunk0,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the cases in birds do not present an immediate public health concern.
102,seg_v5_13_102_chunk0,No human cases of the avian influenza virus have been detected in the United States. It remains safe to eat poultry products.
102,seg_v5_15_102_chunk0,Cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165°F kills bacteria and viruses.
102,seg_v5_16_102_chunk0,This story has been updated to correct the total number of birds killed in the U.S. to 22 million including all types and to correct the number killed in Iowa to 13 million instead of 18 million.
102,seg_v5_17_102_chunk0,"It [This story] was updated on April 5, 2022 to correct the total number of birds killed in the U.S. at 22 million including all types and in Iowa to 13 million instead of 18 million."
1674,seg_v5_1_1674_chunk0,"On April 1, it was confirmed that H5N1 had spread to at least one person who worked with cattle as of April 30, 36 dairy herds have been confirmed to have had cases of bird flu, although that's a likely undercount based on limited testing."
1674,seg_v5_2_1674_chunk0,"On April 25, the FDA announced its finding that one in five milk samples from grocery stores had trace amounts of H5N1."
1674,seg_v5_3_1674_chunk0,"Colombia has restricted the import of beef from US states where the virus has been detected in cows, and the USDA is now testing ground beef for H5N1."
1674,seg_v5_4_1674_chunk0,"The World Health Organization reported that between January 2003 and March 2024, 56 percent of bird flu cases detected in humans were fatal."
1674,seg_v5_5_1674_chunk0,Half the domestic cats on a Texas farm also recently died after drinking raw milk from cows infected with H5N1.
1674,seg_v5_8_1674_chunk0,(human-to-human transmission hasn't been detected in the US yet).
1674,seg_v5_9_1674_chunk0,"As a result, more and more people are buying raw milk: Ambrook Research reports that sales 'jumped 27 percent, from $12 million in 2021 to $19.4 million' in 2023."
1674,seg_v5_10_1674_chunk0,A 2022 research paper estimates that around four and a half percent of Americans are consuming raw milk at least once annually.
1674,seg_v5_11_1674_chunk0,"Which is ironic: besides bird flu, raw milk consumption has been linked to cases of the diseases salmonella and listeriosis."
1674,seg_v5_12_1674_chunk0,"'The more people see of this type of pro-raw-milk content in their social media feeds, algorithms will keep giving them more of it [pro-raw-milk content], and then they are less likely to see stories about people harmed by raw milk,' Gall Myrick said."
1674,seg_v5_13_1674_chunk0,"Many states still do not allow raw milk to be sold in stores, with some exceptions for farms, meaning that people inspired by raw milk influencers may have to go through more hurdles to buy it."
1470,seg_v5_1_1470_chunk0,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a health alert following confirmation of a person becoming infected with avian influenza, also known as bird flu."
1470,seg_v5_2_1470_chunk0,"The CDC announced on April 1 that a dairy farm worker in Texas had been been diagnosed with the H5N1 bird flu, marking only the second national case of the virus infecting a person."
1470,seg_v5_3_1470_chunk0,The only other known U.S. case was diagnosed in a Colorado poultry worker in 2022.
1470,seg_v5_4_1470_chunk0,"On Friday, the CDC alert stressed the importance of informing clinicians, state health departments, and the public of a recently confirmed human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza, while pointing out that the infection had likely been acquired from dairy cows."
1470,seg_v5_5_1470_chunk0,The alert recommends that those working with birds or livestock use personal protective equipment (PPE) to lower the risk of infection.
1470,seg_v5_6_1470_chunk0,PPE is also recommended when dealing with people who may have been exposed to the virus.
1470,seg_v5_7_1470_chunk0,"A CDC spokesperson told Newsweek via email on Friday night that the alert is intended to inform clinicians, while risks to the general public remain low."
1470,seg_v5_8_1470_chunk0,The alert urges health care workers to monitor patients showing signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness or conjunctivitis and who have relevant exposure history and suggests the isolation of those who may have contracted bird flu.
1470,seg_v5_9_1470_chunk0,"The lone symptom in the Texas patient was conjunctivitis, or inflammation of the eye."
1470,seg_v5_10_1470_chunk0,"However, bird flu can also cause coughing, sore throat, fever, fatigue, shortness of breath and other serious symptoms."
1470,seg_v5_11_1470_chunk0,Over half of the over 900 human H5N1 cases reported globally since 1997 have resulted in death.
1470,seg_v5_12_1470_chunk0,The CDC stressed the importance of those working with animals following recommendations that may reduce the chances of a future outbreak.
1470,seg_v5_13_1470_chunk0,"The public was also urged to take common-sense measures to prevent infection, despite risks currently being low."
1470,seg_v5_14_1470_chunk0,"People should avoid being near sick or dead animals or surfaces contaminated with the animal's feces, litter, raw milk, or other byproducts when not wearing respiratory or eye protection, the alert states."
1470,seg_v5_16_1470_chunk0,"While there have long been concerns about bird flu infections in people potentially sparking a new epidemic or pandemic, there have been no known cases of human-to-human transmission involving the viruses that are currently circulating."
1470,seg_v5_17_1470_chunk0,"However, public health officials expressed concerns last month following the discovery of the first known H5N1 cases in cattle, marking the first time that the virus had jumped from birds to cows."
1470,seg_v5_18_1470_chunk0,"The dairy cow outbreak began in late March and quickly spread from Texas, where the human case was also diagnosed, to include cases in at least six different states as of Friday."
1470,seg_v5_19_1470_chunk0,The CDC said that testing of the virus had not revealed any genetic changes that would increase the likelihood of human infections or hinder the effectiveness of antiviral medications to combat infections.
948,seg_v5_1_948_chunk0,"Japan has detected its first outbreak of bird flu for the 2021 winter season, with confirmation of a case of 'highly pathogenic avian influenza' at a poultry farm in the northeast of the country, the agriculture ministry said on Wednesday."
948,seg_v5_2_948_chunk0,"About 143,000 egg-laying chickens are being exterminated at the farm in Yokote city in Akita Prefecture, the ministry said in a statement on its website, adding that restricted zones up to 10 km (6.2 miles) from the site have been established."
948,seg_v5_3_948_chunk0,"'Under the current situation in Japan, we do not believe that there is any possibility of avian influenza being transmitted to humans through the consumption of chicken meat or eggs,' the ministry said."
948,seg_v5_4_948_chunk0,"But an increase in the number of people in China getting infected from bird flu this year is turning into a source of concern among epidemiological experts, especially as the world slowly recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic."
948,seg_v5_5_948_chunk0,"China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza in 2021 to the World Health Organization, compared with only five last year, it [China] said, with six dead and many of the others critically ill."
948,seg_v5_6_948_chunk0,"Outbreaks of bird flu have also been reported in recent days and weeks in Europe with farms in Poland the latest locations for infections, totalling 650,000 poultry."
948,seg_v5_7_948_chunk0,"Last winter, Japan had its worst season of winter flu on farms yet, with more than 3 million chickens culled and a quarter of the country's prefectures affected."
1534,seg_v5_1_1534_chunk0,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Wednesday that all the ground beef samples sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) for PCR testing, tested negative for H5N1 virus."
1534,seg_v5_2_1534_chunk0,"""NVSL reported that all samples tested negative for H5N1. These results reaffirm that the meat supply is safe,"" the USDA added."
1534,seg_v5_3_1534_chunk0,Federal authorities have been working to confirm the safety of milk and meat products following the detection of the H5N1 virus in 34 dairy cattle herds across nine states since the end of March.
1534,seg_v5_4_1534_chunk0,"Additionally, one case has been confirmed in a person in Texas."
1534,seg_v5_5_1534_chunk0,"Both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have said the overall public health risk is low, but is higher for those with exposure to infected animals."
647,seg_v5_1_647_chunk0,"As the co-founder of Wild Instincts animal rescue in Wisconsin's Northwoods, Naniot and his team spent the season sweating in gloves, gowns, smocks and masks and going through what felt like endless rounds of disinfection as they moved between the cages of the sick and injured animals they cared for."
647,seg_v5_2_647_chunk0,"Then, there was H5N1 bird flu to contend with."
647,seg_v5_3_647_chunk0,"""It's highly, highly transmissible,"" said Naniot, who has been involved in animal rescue for 35 years."
647,seg_v5_4_647_chunk0,"Since it was first discovered in birds in 1996, H5N1 has shown itself to be a Swiss Army Knife of a virus, evolving the necessary tools to break into the cells of a growing list of species. So far, it has infected and killed millions of wild and farmed birds."
647,seg_v5_6_647_chunk0,"It's also been found in at least 26 different kinds of mammals, including, most recently in the United States — cows, cats and house mice."
647,seg_v5_7_647_chunk0,"The voraciousness of the virus prompted Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist of the World Health Organization in April to call it ""a global zoonotic animal pandemic."""
647,seg_v5_8_647_chunk0,"Along the way, people have been a kind of collateral damage."
647,seg_v5_9_647_chunk0,"Humans can be infected, but we aren't really the intended targets. That could all change quickly, however."
647,seg_v5_11_647_chunk0,"""Influenza actually makes mutations, in the sense of making errors copying its genome, at a higher rate than a coronavirus like SARS-CoV2,"" said Dr. Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist who focuses on influenza viruses at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle. ""Influenza actually makes mutations, in the sense of making errors copying its genome, at a higher rate than a coronavirus like SARS-CoV2,"" said Dr. Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist who focuses on influenza viruses at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle. These errors [in genome copying] don't always work in favor of the virus."
647,seg_v5_13_647_chunk0,"""Influenza actually makes mutations, in the sense of making errors copying its genome, at a higher rate than a coronavirus like SARS-CoV2,"" said Dr. Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist who focuses on influenza viruses at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle. These errors [in genome copying] don't always work in favor of the virus. Most of the time, viruses with errors [in genome copying] won't work or be fit enough to continue to copy and survive."
647,seg_v5_14_647_chunk0,"""Influenza actually makes mutations, in the sense of making errors copying its genome, at a higher rate than a coronavirus like SARS-CoV2,"" said Dr. Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist who focuses on influenza viruses at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle. These errors [in genome copying] don't always work in favor of the virus. Most of the time, viruses with errors [in genome copying] won't work or be fit enough to continue to copy and survive. But every once in a while, a random error [in genome copying] can result in a change to the virus that gives it an advantage in its environment, and that version of the virus will continue to spread and grow."
647,seg_v5_15_647_chunk0,"If humans happen to be that environment, and H5N1 changes at the right place at the right time, suddenly the animal pandemic could become a major problem for people, too."
647,seg_v5_16_647_chunk0,"Naniot had seen wild birds come into Wild Instincts rescue with H5N1 — bald eagles, hawks and owls — but nothing had prepared him for the red fox kits."
647,seg_v5_17_647_chunk0,"The baby foxes were brought in stumbling and uncoordinated, making him think they might have gotten into some kind of poison. Then the seizures started."
647,seg_v5_19_647_chunk0,"""They would have these severe, severe seizures,"" Naniot said."
647,seg_v5_20_647_chunk0,"""Screaming very loud, whole-body tremors."" The first seizures lasted for 20 to 30 seconds at a time."
647,seg_v5_22_647_chunk0,"The first seizures lasted for 20 to 30 seconds at a time. ""And then it [the seizures] would get longer and longer and longer,"" he [Naniot] said."
647,seg_v5_23_647_chunk0,Naniot hadn't known his young patients could get bird flu.
647,seg_v5_24_647_chunk0,"Further research clued him in to the fact that foxes had recently joined a growing list of species that could succumb, usually after eating the flesh of infected dead birds."
647,seg_v5_25_647_chunk0,"""The severity of the seizures is something I really hadn't seen before,"" Naniot said."
647,seg_v5_26_647_chunk0,"""It's a very sad thing to see, the progression of the disease."""
647,seg_v5_27_647_chunk0,"Though H5N1 is known to have infected nearly 900 people in the past 30 years, these infections have been sporadic and usually self-limiting."
647,seg_v5_28_647_chunk0,"The virus can still be deadly, however: More than 50% of people who are known to have been infected with H5N1 have died. Still, the virus isn't particularly good at infecting humans."
647,seg_v5_30_647_chunk0,"Even when the virus manages to get into a person and cause symptoms, it rarely gets passed to someone else."
647,seg_v5_31_647_chunk0,"""We call these dead-end infections,"" said Dr. Scott Weese, a veterinarian and expert in zoonotic infections, at the University of Guelph in Canada."
647,seg_v5_32_647_chunk0,"The way a dead-end infection happens, Weese explains, is that a person is around a large amount of the virus, or their immune system is too weak to resist, and H5N1 gets in."
647,seg_v5_33_647_chunk0,"But it is not a virus that's well-adapted to humans, so it never really builds up in respiratory secretions — the fluid that coats the nose, throat, and lungs — which would give it a way out through coughs, sneezes or even exhaled breath."
647,seg_v5_34_647_chunk0,"There have been at least three of these apparently dead-end infections in dairy workers in the US, who worked closely with infected milk cows."
647,seg_v5_35_647_chunk0,"Two of the workers developed conjunctivitis, or eye infections."
647,seg_v5_36_647_chunk0,"In one case, the worker reported getting splashed with raw milk in their eyes."
647,seg_v5_37_647_chunk0,A third developed respiratory symptoms after close contact with cows.
647,seg_v5_38_647_chunk0,All were successfully treated with an antiviral medication.
647,seg_v5_39_647_chunk0,None developed severe symptoms or infected others.
647,seg_v5_40_647_chunk0,"Using a strain of H5N1 from the recent cattle outbreak, scientists recently confirmed that this version of the virus is unlikely to transmit through the air."
647,seg_v5_41_647_chunk0,"In experiments with ferrets, which are considered the gold standard for studying how viruses transmit in people, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grew a sample of the same H5N1 virus taken from a farmworker with the flu in Texas to experimentally infect six of the animals."
647,seg_v5_42_647_chunk0,"Then, three healthy ferrets were placed in the same enclosures with three of the sick animals."
647,seg_v5_43_647_chunk0,"Then, three healthy ferrets were placed in the same enclosures with three of the sick animals. These animals [healthy ferrets] could touch, nose and lick the sick animals, and all of them became ill."
647,seg_v5_44_647_chunk0,"Next, the CDC tested airborne transmission by putting three healthy ferrets into an enclosure where they could breathe the same air as sick animals but couldn't touch them."
647,seg_v5_45_647_chunk0,"Only one of those three animals became ill, suggesting that the virus carried by cattle in the current outbreak is not well adapted to respiratory spread, the CDC wrote in a news release on the study. Only one of those three animals became ill, suggesting that the virus carried by cattle in the current outbreak is not well adapted to respiratory spread, the CDC wrote in a news release on the study. So far, that [the finding that the virus is not well adapted to respiratory spread] seems to be what's happening in the real world, too."
647,seg_v5_47_647_chunk0,"Though more than 80 dairy herds have tested positive across at least 12 states, the number of human infections has apparently been low, though there's been little testing to confirm that."
647,seg_v5_48_647_chunk0,"Only one of those three animals became ill, suggesting that the virus carried by cattle in the current outbreak is not well adapted to respiratory spread, the CDC wrote in a news release on the study. These early ferret experiments [described in the study] are good news, the CDC noted, because it [the finding] means the virus would need to change to become an infection spread person-to-person through the airborne droplets."
647,seg_v5_49_647_chunk0,The agency said it plans to repeat the tests.
647,seg_v5_50_647_chunk0,"As Covid has shown, all of this could change in the rub of an eye or a small cough."
914,seg_v5_4_914_chunk0,"Russia registered the first case of a strain of bird flu virus named influenza A(H5N8) being passed to humans from birds and has reported the matter to the WHO, Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, said on Saturday."
914,seg_v5_3_914_chunk0,The outbreak [H1N1 pandemic] turned out to be mild among humans.
914,seg_v5_2_914_chunk0,"A separate influenza strain, H1N1, that emerged from pigs and spread rapidly worldwide among humans led the WHO to declare an influenza pandemic in 2009-2010."
914,seg_v5_1_914_chunk0,"The risk of human-to-human spread of the H5N8 strain of bird flu appears low after it was identified for the first time worldwide in farm workers in Russia, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday."
1286,seg_v5_9_1286_chunk0,"Humans are considered to be at low risk from HPAI, although there have been reported infections."
1286,seg_v5_8_1286_chunk0,"Avian flu occurs mainly in birds including domestic chickens, but it [Avian flu] has been found in other animals, wild and domestic, in all U.S. states except Hawaii."
1286,seg_v5_7_1286_chunk0,"HPAI hasn’t been detected in other populations in California or Mexico’s Baja California, according to the park service."
1286,seg_v5_6_1286_chunk0,Exposure to the virus is expected to rise during the condors’ northward spring migration.
1286,seg_v5_5_1286_chunk0,"One bird died and the other four have been quarantined, officials said."
1286,seg_v5_4_1286_chunk0,"The Peregrine Fund, which manages the Arizona-Utah flock, also captured five other birds that seemed ill and sent them [five other birds] to a wildlife rescue in Phoenix."
1286,seg_v5_3_1286_chunk0,"Two other birds later found dead also tested positive, while test results aren’t yet completed for five others, the park service said."
1286,seg_v5_2_1286_chunk0,"A sick female condor suspected of having lead poisoning was found dead on March 20 and testing showed it [sick female condor] had Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), the park service said."
1286,seg_v5_1_1286_chunk0,"Three California condors have died from avian flu in northern Arizona and authorities are trying to determine what killed five others in the flock, the National Park Service announced Friday."
192,seg_v5_7_192_chunk0,Officials with the Tanana Valley State Fair in Fairbanks also opted against including poultry this year.
192,seg_v5_6_192_chunk0,"The office [state veterinarian's office] says the risk to human health is low but that the virus is highly contagious among birds and can affect all types of domestic poultry, causing illness or death."
192,seg_v5_5_192_chunk0,Most states have reported cases.
192,seg_v5_4_192_chunk0,"More than 100 cases have been confirmed so far, according to the state veterinarian's office."
192,seg_v5_3_192_chunk0,"In late April, state officials announced the first confirmed case in Alaska of a strain of a highly pathogenic avian flu virus."
192,seg_v5_2_192_chunk0,Fair CEO Jerome Hertel in a statement said officials believed it was best 'to err on the side of caution.'
192,seg_v5_1_192_chunk0,Officials with the Alaska State Fair have decided against the usual array of poultry exhibits this year amid avian flu concerns.
1198,seg_v5_4_1198_chunk0,"""The whole (population of the) hall will have to be culled,"" said Petr Majer, SVS spokesman."
1198,seg_v5_3_1198_chunk0,"The Czech Republic's State Veterinary Administration (SVS) said on Tuesday that since checks revealed the infection only in one of the halls, the majority of the flock could be spared."
1198,seg_v5_2_1198_chunk0,"Bird flu was reported last Friday at the farm located 150 km (90 miles) west from Prague, which can house up to 750,000 chickens, after an increase of deaths in one of three halls there."
1198,seg_v5_1_1198_chunk0,"Czech authorities are preparing to destroy up to 220,000 hens on a poultry farm in the west of the country after bird flu was discovered there last week, in the biggest outbreak to date."
1065,seg_v5_37_1065_chunk0,If everyone takes all the right precautions … new cases of the virus are expected to stop when those wild birds migrate in the summer.
1065,seg_v5_36_1065_chunk0,"Dr. Thompson says the virus is carried by wild water birds-like ducks, geese and swans."
1065,seg_v5_35_1065_chunk0,Many state boards of animal health are asking people who own chickens or turkeys to watch out for signs their birds are acting unusually and call a vet or the state if they think one of their birds could be infected.
1065,seg_v5_34_1065_chunk0,"States including Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota have temporarily banned poultry community sales, swaps, fairs and any other kind of event that brings poultry together to get a handle on this virus."
1065,seg_v5_33_1065_chunk0,"And if it’s not [the safety net], it’s [the consequence of no safety net] going to be devastating. It’s [the devastating impact] going to put a company like ours out of business very fast, Klaphake said."
1065,seg_v5_32_1065_chunk0,"Scary thing is, as this [outbreak] grows, will that safety net be there all the time? And if it’s not [the safety net], it’s [the consequence of no safety net] going to be devastating."
1065,seg_v5_31_1065_chunk0,"Scary thing is, as this [outbreak] grows, will that safety net be there all the time?"
1065,seg_v5_30_1065_chunk0,"The Agriculture Department pays farmers for birds that must be killed if there is an outbreak, but uncertainty remains."
1065,seg_v5_29_1065_chunk0,"The hardest hit states are Minnesota, Maryland, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Nebraska and Iowa."
1065,seg_v5_28_1065_chunk0,"The virus has affected nearly 23 million birds in 24 states, in 90 commercial and 38 backyard flocks in the U.S."
1065,seg_v5_27_1065_chunk0,"It has to be absolutely sterile, or we’re going to spread it from farm to farm, and we would cause problems."
1065,seg_v5_26_1065_chunk0,"Some equipment that we’ve used in the past we’re not bringing with us because we can’t get it as clean as we need to, Wierschke said."
1065,seg_v5_25_1065_chunk0,Their season is going to look a little different as the flu tears through farms.
1065,seg_v5_24_1065_chunk0,Clean Chickens and Company is the only mobile chicken processing company in Minnesota.
1065,seg_v5_23_1065_chunk0,"If we do have a positive and we could very easily be the next one we don’t know how to deal with it, Klaphake said."
1065,seg_v5_22_1065_chunk0,"They haven’t had an outbreak yet, but they’re anxiously watching as farmers around them see infections."
1065,seg_v5_20_1065_chunk0,Klaphake also owns R & L Turkeys. He says his company raises around 30 million pounds of turkey a year.
1065,seg_v5_19_1065_chunk0,"According to Forbes, the cost of eggs has doubled since the outbreak."

647,seg_v5_75_647_chunk0,Whereas ingesting large amounts of virus — as some animals do when they scavenge for food or as humans in some countries do when consuming dishes made with duck blood — could lead to severe disease.
647,seg_v5_74_647_chunk0,"Touching contaminated milk or the body of a dead bird and then rubbing your eyes or nose might deliver a smaller dose of the virus, and ultimately result in milder symptoms."
647,seg_v5_73_647_chunk0,Bright thinks severity of symptoms may depend on how much virus a person is exposed to when they are infected.
647,seg_v5_72_647_chunk0,The government has also said it is working on the development of a rapid test for H5N1.
647,seg_v5_71_647_chunk0,"But so far, wearing this equipment is voluntary, and there are concerns that it might be difficult for farm workers to wear the full recommended kit, which includes coveralls, an apron, a mask, eye protection, a head covering, gloves and boots during the summer, which is again expected to break heat records."
647,seg_v5_70_647_chunk0,"The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, has made that protective equipment available to states for use on farms, and the USDA has made additional funding available to farms to support efforts to safeguard their livestock from disease."
647,seg_v5_69_647_chunk0,"For now, the CDC maintains its assessment that the risk to the general public from H5N1 is low, though people who work with infected animals have a higher risk and should wear protective clothing and take additional precautions to avoid getting sick."

647,seg_v5_67_647_chunk0,"The US has vaccines against H5 viruses in its Strategic National Stockpile, and last month, government officials said 4.8 million doses are being ""filled and finished"" so they would be ready for use, though there's no plan to give them to anyone yet."
647,seg_v5_66_647_chunk0,"How much help we might get from past exposures to flu viruses is difficult to predict, however, which is why vaccination would still be important to tune up our immunity."
647,seg_v5_65_647_chunk0,"So while we probably don't have any antibodies — the immune system's front-line soldiers — at the ready to fight off an H5 infection, there are memory cells in our tissues that might recognize parts of a new flu virus and respond."
647,seg_v5_64_647_chunk0,"She says she hasn't tested this with any of the strains involved in the cattle outbreak, however."
647,seg_v5_63_647_chunk0,"In her lab, ferrets with previous exposures to seasonal flu strains didn't get as sick when exposed to new flu viruses compared to those with no prior exposure to seasonal strains."

647,seg_v5_59_647_chunk0,"In the more than two dozen human infections with H5N1 virus worldwide since 2022, with the most recent iteration of the virus, there's been a wide spectrum of severity."
