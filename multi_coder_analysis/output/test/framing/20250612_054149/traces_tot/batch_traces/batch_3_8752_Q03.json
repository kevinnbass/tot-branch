(Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: \"The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%.\" (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).\n* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: \"Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds.\" (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').\n\n**Key Principle:** \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" \"plummeted\" can be potent verbs on their own (see Q2) if used dramatically. This rule specifically addresses their use when their alarmist nature is confirmed by accompanying details of scale/impact.\n\n**Boundary Requirements (clarified):**\n1. Verb **must appear in the approved list / regex**.  \n2. Must denote realised impact (not a plan or hypothetical).  \n3. Plain outcome verbs (*killed, died, affected, reported*) are excluded—Neutral unless other cues fire.\n\n**Examples of Scale/Impact Indicators:**\n- Numerical quantities: \"millions,\" \"thousands,\" \"50%,\" \"record numbers\"\n- Comparative terms: \"largest,\" \"highest,\" \"most severe,\" \"unprecedented\"\n- Impact descriptors: \"overwhelming,\" \"devastating losses,\" \"widespread damage\"\n\n> **New aspect guard.** The moderate-verb must denote **realised impact** – NOT merely an intention or hypothetical.  \n\n**Regex Pattern (tightened – comment shows exclusion):**\n```regex\n\\b(hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|\n     # ONLY active, realised culling counts\n     (?:were|was)\\s+culled|hitting)\\b\n(?=[^.]{0,40}\\b(?:\\d|million|millions|thousand|thousands|record|largest|unprecedented|severe|significant|overwhelming|devastating|disaster|disasters|emergency|emergencies)\\b)\n```\n# Passive/future forms (\"to be culled\", \"had to be culled\", \"planning to cull\")\n# fall through to Q8 (capability) or Q10 (speculative relief).\n\n**Clarification (v 2.16.2)** — Containment actions  \n\"Birds were *euthanized/depopulated* to prevent spread\" is **Neutral** unless paired with an explicit large-scale impact (e.g., \"euthanized ***millions*** of birds across 10 states\").\n\nIf the parser lemmatises verbs, **keep only the past-tense form** `culled`; exclude the lemma \"cull\" and its gerund unless explicitly preceded by a past-tense auxiliary (\"were/was culling\") that confirms an event already occurred.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` ",

  "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Segments**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with going through these ten segments and determining if they meet the criteria for Q3: a moderate verb paired with scale or impact information. My initial read-through shows the need for careful attention to verb tenses and the specific verb list.\n\n*   **Initial Review and Disqualification:** I quickly see that the majority of these segments are descriptive, reporting facts, or discussing future possibilities.  My focus is on identifying verbs from the specific list *in combination* with concrete impact metrics. Simply finding an impact without a matching verb is not enough.\n\n*   **Segment-Specific Breakdown:**\n\n    *   **Segments 1, 7, and 8:** These were straightforward. No moderate verbs, and no impact directly linked to a verb.\n    *   **Segment 2:** While there are impacts (864 people, 456 deaths), the verbs used are largely descriptive. No Q3 match.\n    *   **Segment 3:**  \"is responsible for\" doesn't make the cut. The impact (25,000 turkeys) is there, but the verb isn't moderate.\n    *   **Segment 4:** This one immediately flags Q4 or Q10 because it's a future plan, not a realized impact.\n    *   **Segment 5 and 6:** Again, descriptive verbs and no direct match to a listed moderate verb/impact combo.\n    *   **Segment 9:** This one trips up on the future/potential verbs (\"threatens to spark\"). The impact information is present, but it's attached to a speculative action.\n    *   **Segment 10:**  This segment presents a classic case where the \"killed\" verb is explicitly disqualified. I see the impact data (\"50 million birds\", \"$1 billion\"), but because it's paired with factual verbs, it doesn't meet the standard.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:** After carefully reviewing each segment, I've concluded that *none* of them fulfill the criteria for Q3. I'll format the output as a JSON array with all \"no\" responses.\n"
