The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)\n\n**Clarification on \"deadly,\" \"fatal,\" \"lethal\":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, \"deadly\" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.\n\n**Minimal Pair Examples:**\n* **Neutral:** \"The virus is contagious.\"\n* **Alarmist (Author):** \"The virus is frighteningly contagious, spreading like wildfire.\" (Cue: 'frighteningly,' 'spreading like wildfire').\n\n**New Comparative Minimal Pair Example:**\n* **Alarmist:** \"Scientists warn the virus is becoming deadlier each season.\"\n* **Neutral:** \"Scientists track how the virus becomes more common each season.\"\n\n**⚠ TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  \nA term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. \"lethal dose 50\").  \n**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – Intensifier + adjective** | \"The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.\" | **Alarmist** | \"so deadly\" (intensifier + risk adjective) |\n| **Alarmist – Deadly-from-outset idiom** | \"H5N1 is deadly from the start, vets warn.\" | **Alarmist** | \"deadly from the start\" (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom) |\n\n**Regex Pattern  (v2.16.2):**\n```regex\n # Ignore the fixed scientific term \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\"\n \\b(?:(?:highly(?!\\s+pathogenic\\s+avian(?:\\s+flu|\\s+influenza)?))\n     |very|deadlier|more|extremely|severely|so|particularly|frighteningly)  \n     (?:\\s+\\w+){0,3}\\s+\n # Risk-adj list (adding infectious, transmissible) while pruning ECON adjective \"volatile\"\n (deadly|lethal|dangerous|severe|catastrophic|brutal|contagious|virulent|destructive|infectious|transmissible)\\b|\n # NEW (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom)\n \\bdeadly\\s+from\\s+(?:the\\s+)?(?:start|outset)\\b\n```\n\n**EXCLUSION — \"volatile\"**  \nWhen \"volatile\" modifies *prices/markets/rates* it is treated as an **economic metric** (see Q9) and never triggers Q1.\n\n> **Technical-term guard** – \"highly pathogenic\" used as part of the formal\n> disease name (HPAI) is **Neutral** unless further alarmist cues appear.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` ",

  "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: A Deep Dive into Risk Language**\n\nAlright, I've got my marching orders: evaluate ten text segments for alarmist language, specifically looking for intensifiers or comparative adjectives modifying risk adjectives, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\" My approach is systematic: I'll carefully dissect each segment, checking for those specific linguistic triggers.\n\nIn the first segment, \"Human infection is rare but can occur...\" I see no red flags. \"Rare\" is present, but it's a low-risk adjective and not the target of any intensification.\n\nMoving to the second, \"There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu...\" I quickly note the technical term \"highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\" It's a key technical term, so unless it's bundled with other alarmist indicators, I’m leaning towards a \"no\" on Q1.\n\nSegment three mentions \"bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys...\" While \"deaths\" is a consequence of the situation, it's not intensified language itself, so no alarm bells there. This pattern continues through segments four and five; mentions of \"culling tens of thousands of birds\" and \"blocking access\" are factual descriptions, not heightened descriptions of risk.\n\nSegment six introduces \"the deadly H5N8 virus.\" Now, \"deadly\" is a risk adjective. However, its use is factual. There's no comparative or intensifier modifying it, and it's not the fixed idiom. So, even with a risk adjective present, no Q1 trigger here.\n\nSegment seven discusses biosecurity and reporting \"sick birds\" and \"unusual bird deaths.\" Again, I see no intensification of those descriptions or any hint of the \"deadly from the start/outset\" idiom.\n\nSegment eight, \"The risk of humans contracting bird flu is very low...\" Contains \"very low.\" \"Low\" isn't a high-risk adjective, and \"very\" actually intensifies low, and the *goal* isn't to look for a low-impact threat. This signals reassurances, not alarm.\n\nSegment nine is a bit denser. \"The virus... has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl.\" I have \"deadly to\", and it's used *as* a factual description. It also has the factual phrases \"threatens to spark shortages\" and \"soaring inflation.\" None of these meet the strict criteria of Q1.\n\nFinally, in segment ten, I see factual numbers: \"killed 50 million birds\" and \"cost... nearly $1 billion\".  These are factual consequences, not amplified descriptions of the immediate threat.\n\nAcross all ten segments, I see no instances of intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk adjectives, and no occurrences of the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\" Therefore, my final assessment for all segments is \"no\". Now, I'll output the data in the requested JSON array format.\n"
