{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'highly' modifying the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**Initial Assessment: \"Highly Contagious\" - Alarmist Trigger**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to apply the first question of the decision tree to this text segment: \"From Wyoming to Maine, an outbreak of the highly contagious bird flu has swept across farms and backyard flocks in the United States this year, prompting millions of chickens and turkeys to be culled.\"\n\nThe core of Q1 is straightforward:  We're looking for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.  Think \"very dangerous,\" \"more severe,\" that sort of thing. The question explicitly lists examples like \"deadly,\" \"contagious,\" and a host of intensifiers.\n\nScanning the segment, \"highly contagious\" immediately jumps out.  \"Highly\" is a classic intensifier, and \"contagious\" is absolutely a risk-adjective in this context. It's describing the *nature* of the bird flu outbreak.\n\nThat's a direct match to the pattern we're searching for. The rule even gives us a heads-up that \"highly contagious\" is a specific example of an alarmist cue, which is super helpful.  And the regular expression in the guidelines confirms this.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is a resounding *yes*.  The presence of \"highly contagious\" is the deciding factor. The alarm bell has sounded. My next step, as dictated by the decision tree, is to immediately label this as \"Alarmist\" and move on."}
