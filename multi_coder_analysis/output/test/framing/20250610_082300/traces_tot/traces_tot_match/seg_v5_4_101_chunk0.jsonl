{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'highly' modifying the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**Evaluation of Text Segment Against Q1**\n\nOkay, I'm examining the text, \"Better known as the bird flu, avian influenza is a highly contagious and deadly virus that can prey on chickens, turkeys and wild birds, including ducks and geese,\" in light of Q1: \"Does it contain an Intensifier/Comparative directly modifying a Risk-Adjective?\"  The rules specify that Risk-Adjectives include terms like \"contagious,\" and Intensifiers include words like \"highly.\"\n\nMy immediate scan reveals \"highly contagious.\"  \"Highly\" is indeed an intensifier, and \"contagious\" *is* a risk-adjective.  The rule explicitly lists \"highly + contagious\" as a match!  Therefore, I'm confident that the answer to Q1 is \"yes.\" My rationale must quote that direct match, \"highly contagious.\" Since Q1 is the highest priority and this condition is met, I'll cease evaluation here and output the JSON."}
