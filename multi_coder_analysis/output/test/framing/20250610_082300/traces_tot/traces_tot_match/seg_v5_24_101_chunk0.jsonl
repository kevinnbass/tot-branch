{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains 'sharply higher' describing a price trend, but 'higher' is not a risk-adjective as defined in Q1.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Evaluation: \"Trending Sharply Higher\"**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to apply Q1 of the decision tree to this text snippet: \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\"\n\nThe key is looking for an intensifier or comparative *directly* modifying a risk adjective. I've got my list of risk adjectives and intensifiers/comparatives ready. Let's see...\n\nThe phrase \"trending sharply higher\" stands out. \"Sharply\" *is* an intensifier, and \"higher\" *is* a comparative. However, \"higher\" isn't modifying a risk adjective like \"dangerous\" or \"lethal.\" It's modifying \"trending,\" which describes the direction of the price. The direction itself isn't inherently risky, it's just the price *trend* that's being described.\n\nThis brings up that context guard about vivid language in background conditions. I know to be very attentive to that. The phrase paints a picture, but it's painting a picture of a price trend, not the direct impact of a threat. That's key. We're looking for alarmist cues directly about the threat, not about related economic measures.\n\nSo, while it's vivid language, it doesn't fit the criteria.  My answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" The segment doesn't contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk adjective.\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The phrase 'trending sharply higher' contains an intensifier ('sharply') and a comparative adjective ('higher'), but 'higher' modifies 'trending' (a description of price direction), not a risk adjective as defined in Q1. The context guard for vivid language also applies, as the vivid language describes a background economic condition, not the direct impact of a threat.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase \"trending sharply higher\" uses a moderate verb ('trending') and an intensifier ('sharply higher') but not a high-potency verb or potent metaphor as defined by Q2.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and tasked with evaluating it against Question 2 of our decision tree.  My job is to see if this segment triggers any red flags related to alarming framing, specifically looking for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative/negative noun combinations, or critical alert phrases.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a \"high-potency\" verb or metaphor in this context.  I've got the list: \"ravaged,\" \"skyrocketed,\" \"nightmare scenario,\" and so on.  Things that really amp up the drama.  I'm also looking for things like \"worst crisis\" or \"on high alert.\"\n\nThe text in question is: \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\"\n\nLet's dissect this. I see the phrase \"'trending sharply higher.'\"  \"Trending\" feels neutral to me. It's descriptive, but not inherently alarming. \"Sharply higher\" is an intensifier, indicating a significant increase, but is it enough?\n\nI need to apply the Q2 rules. \"Trending\" isn't on the high-potency verb list. \"Sharply higher\" isn't a potent metaphor either. It's not a superlative + negative noun combination, and there are no critical alert phrases.\n\nThe key here is the *verb*. Q2 specifically focuses on verbs like \"skyrocketed,\" and \"soared\" (when it's about impacts) to indicate alarm. \"Trending\" is about direction and pattern, but it's not about the magnitude of the impact directly.  It's just describing the increase, not dramatizing it.  Even if it was, \"soaring\" applies in the context of impact nouns.\n\nEven if it had said \"prices are sharply higher\", it wouldn't qualify; Q1 addresses intensified adjectives describing risk.\n\nI have to answer \"no\" to Q2. My rationale? While the language suggests a significant price increase, it doesn't utilize the kind of high-potency verbs or potent metaphors that Q2 is designed to flag. \"Trending sharply higher\" isn't alarmist in the way our criteria define."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'trending' is not on the list of specified moderate verbs for Q3, although 'sharply higher' indicates scale/impact.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Analysis: \"Trending Sharply Higher\"**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The task is to check this text segment against Q3, which means I need to see if it uses a \"moderate verb\" from a specific list, *paired with* some indication of significant scale or impact.\n\nFirst, I identified the verb phrase: \"'trending sharply higher'\". Now, here's where it gets interesting. I immediately checked that against the Q3 list of verbs and the regex. It has the verbs I'm looking for, like \"soared\" or \"plummeted\", to highlight significant movement.  The phrase \"trending sharply higher\" *does* communicate scale, with \"sharply higher\" indicating an increase in price.\n\nHowever, the verb itself, \"trending\", is the problem. It's an adverb (\"sharply\") modifying an adjective (\"higher\") with the core verb being \"trending\", and that's not one of the verbs on the list for Q3. The guard about \"vivid language\" doesn't quite apply here, as this isn't vivid language coloring a background condition, it is the actual price description.  The phrase *does* focus on a change in the prices of eggs.\n\nSo, while the phrase does contain scale/impact information (the \"sharply higher\" part), the core verb \"trending\" isn't on the Q3 list of *moderate verbs*. Therefore, Q3 doesn't apply. I'll need to clearly state that the verb is not on the list, even though there's an impact described."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a fact and does not contain any question, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, I've got to evaluate this text snippet against Q4 of the decision tree. Q4's looking for loaded rhetorical questions, the kind designed to subtly instill alarm. I need to see if this sentence, \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.,\" fits that bill.\n\nHmm, seems straightforward. It's a statement of fact, simply reporting a trend. It cites a source – a U.S.D.A. report – which is good practice. I don't see any question marks, no implied anxieties, nothing that would even vaguely qualify as a rhetorical question, let alone a loaded one.\n\nTherefore, Q4's a definite \"no\" here.  I'll format my response as a JSON object with the clear \"answer\" and the \"rationale\" just outlined."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text reports a price trend ('trending sharply higher') but contains no explicit language from the author or source designed to calm concerns, assure safety, or minimize risk.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Calming Cues in the Egg Price Report**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to assess if it triggers the \"Reassuring\" frame, specifically by checking for explicit calming cues as per Q5. The text reads: \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\"\n\nMy initial thought is to scan this for any phrases that would directly soothe concerns. I'm looking for the usual suspects: \"no cause for alarm,\" \"public can rest easy,\" \"fully under control,\" \"risk is very low,\" \"excellent news,\" or any kind of official preparedness messaging related to public safety.  Essentially, anything that explicitly tells the consumer not to worry.\n\nThe key phrase here is \"trending sharply higher.\"  This is a statement about price increases, a negative economic indicator, and it doesn't give me anything to latch onto for reassurance. It's simply reporting a trend.  The fact that it's attributed to a USDA report lends it some credibility, but the report itself is focused on price, not on alleviating anxieties about safety, control, or risk.  There's no language here that explicitly tells me, the consumer, that I should be calm or that things are under control.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, my answer to Q5 is \"no.\" There are no explicit calming cues present in this text segment."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no minimiser word ('only', 'just', 'merely', 'a single', 'few') or scale contrast ('out of X', 'among Y') used for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Segment Against Q6 of the Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, so I need to assess this text segment to see if it triggers Q6 in the decision tree. Q6, as I understand it, is looking for a specific reassuring pattern: \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast.\" In simpler terms, I'm checking if the text uses a minimizer word (like \"only\" or \"just\") *and* contrasts something small with a larger context to offer reassurance.\n\nLet's dive in: \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\"\n\nFirst, I'm scanning for those minimizer words. Nope, I don't see anything like \"only,\" \"just,\" or any other word that minimizes the price increase. The phrase is straight-forward.\n\nSecond, I need to look for a contrasting larger scale. I'm not seeing any context that implies this \"trending sharply higher\" price is somehow small compared to a larger backdrop. There's no \"only X out of Y\" type comparison. No larger frame of reference is provided to offer reassurance.\n\nFinally, while the phrase \"'trending sharply higher'\" is quoted, it focuses on the *increase* itself and doesn't lean toward reassurance through minimisation and scale contrast.\n\nGiven all this, I conclude that the text segment *does not* meet the criteria for Q6. My answer to Q6 has to be \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the required pattern of minimiser words and scale contrast to create a reassuring effect is absent in the segment."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes an increase ('trending sharply higher') and does not contain any form of bare negation.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and need to evaluate it against decision tree question Q7. That question is specifically looking for a \"bare negation\" – essentially, a denial or negation without a qualifying, reassuring phrase. I know what I'm looking for: phrases that directly negate a potential problem or risk, like \"no problems expected\" or \"not likely to affect.\"\n\nReading through the segment, which discusses the rising price of eggs, I see the phrase \"trending sharply higher.\"  This clearly indicates an increase, a positive slope, rather than a negation of anything. There's no hint of a denial or problem that is described by the statement. This just reports an increase in price.\n\nTherefore, after careful review, it's clear that the segment doesn't contain the type of bare negation Q7 is searching for. My answer to Q7 is \"no.\" I'm ready to move on, but since the user has only asked for the answer to Q7, I'll provide the relevant JSON response."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a market trend ('trending sharply higher') and does not mention capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'trending sharply higher' reports price change using a standard verb ('trending') and a neutral adverb ('sharply'), fitting the Q9 criteria for Neutral.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this segment against Question 9 of the decision tree. Q9 focuses on whether the text describes prices/metrics using acceptable language – think neutral verbs and adverbs, avoiding anything overly vivid or alarmist. Let's see what we have.\n\nThe segment states: \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\"\n\nAlright, so the core of it is the price of eggs. The verb used to describe the price movement is \"trending,\" and the adverb modifying it is \"sharply.\" The phrase is \"'trending sharply higher.'\"\n\nNow, let's consult the rules. I know standard economic verbs like \"rose,\" \"declined,\" \"increased,\" \"fell\" are generally neutral. Adverbs like \"sharply higher\" or \"significantly declined\" are also considered neutral. In contrast, vivid verbs like \"skyrocketed\" or \"plummeted\" are alarmist, and using risk adjectives alongside economic terms is also a red flag.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, the phrase \"Prices **trended sharply higher**\" is explicitly categorized as **Neutral** in the \"Economic & Price Language Quick-Reference.\" The \"Key Principle\" confirms that adverbs like \"sharply\" don't increase the potency unless combined with a vivid verb or a risk adjective. And \"trending\" doesn't seem to be considered a vivid verb; it's a common descriptive term in economic reporting.\n\nTherefore, this segment does indeed fit the criteria for Q9 being a \"yes.\" It reports a price change using an accepted verb (\"trending\") and a neutral adverb (\"sharply\") without any vivid verbs or risk-related adjectives.  This points toward a **Neutral** frame for the segment. I'll output the results accordingly."}
