{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'highly pathogenic' is part of the technical term 'highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)' and is excluded by the rules for Q1.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Claim Framing: Q1 Decision**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"Tyson Foods... confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected...\" and I need to assess it against Q1 of the 12-step decision tree. That means I'm checking for intensifiers or comparative adjectives modifying risk adjectives.\n\nMy initial scan lands on \"highly pathogenic,\" and my instinct is, \"Aha! That's it!\" But, I remember the rules. The \"Technical-term guard\" is clear: \"highly pathogenic\" is neutral when part of a formal disease name, which in this case, it is. It's HPAI, not just \"highly pathogenic\" used to amplify a general risk.\n\nTherefore, even though \"highly\" is an intensifier and \"pathogenic\" *could* be a risk adjective in some contexts, here it's locked within a technical term. Q1 specifically wants to see direct modification of a standalone risk adjective, and this isn't it.\n\nSo, my answer to Q1 is \"no.\" And the rationale? Simple: \"highly pathogenic\" is part of the formal name HPAI, making it exempt under the Q1 rules."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'infected' is a factual, moderate term and does not meet the criteria for a high-potency verb or other Q2 patterns.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Evaluation: A Concise Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet about Tyson Foods and avian influenza, and I'm supposed to evaluate it against Q2 of the decision tree. Q2 is looking for specific warning signs: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative noun combinations, or the \"on high alert\" phrase, all used to paint an alarmist picture.\n\nMy expert eye immediately scans for these markers. The critical piece here is the verb \"infected.\" Does it fit the profile of a high-potency verb, something like \"ravaged,\" \"slaughtered,\" or \"exploding\"?  Nope. \"Infected\" is a factual, biologically accurate term. It's precise, but it doesn't evoke the heightened sense of urgency or impending disaster that Q2 is designed to flag.\n\nI double-checked for potent metaphors, superlative/negative noun pairings, and the \"on high alert\" phrase. Nothing.  The language is straightforward and technical. Therefore, according to my expert analysis based on the established criteria, the answer to Q2 is unequivocally \"no.\"  I would confidently move on to Q3."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'has infected' is a plain factual verb, not a moderate verb from the specified list, and the scale 'a flock at one of its contract farms' is not presented as significant scale/impact.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment Against Question Q3**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this text segment: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\" My task is to determine if this triggers an \"Alarmist\" frame according to the rules of Question Q3.\n\nFirst, I identified the key verb describing the action: \"has infected.\" Now, I had to check if this verb falls into the category of \"moderate verbs\" as defined by the Q3 criteria. I compared it against the list of moderate verbs specified by the regex, which includes things like \"hit,\" \"swept,\" and \"prompted.\" \"Infected\" isn't on that list, and furthermore, the rules specifically *exclude* plain factual verbs like \"killed,\" \"died,\" or \"affected.\" \"Infected\" definitely seems to fit into that \"plain factual\" category.\n\nNext, I looked for information regarding the scale or impact. The text mentions \"a flock at one of its contract farms.\" That's quite specific and limited in scope. It's not referring to widespread devastation or massive losses. It's not the same as saying \"millions culled\" or \"thousands affected,\" which would clearly indicate a significant impact.\n\nSince Q3 requires *both* a moderate verb *and* significant scale/impact to be present, and neither condition is met here, my answer is a definitive \"no.\" The verb is factual, and the scale is limited. Therefore, I'll now generate the JSON output with the appropriate response and rationale."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement reporting a fact and contains no questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Question Q4**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a statement about an HPAI outbreak at a Tyson Foods farm in Kentucky and asked to assess it against Question Q4. My goal is to determine if the statement employs a loaded rhetorical question designed to illicit alarm.\n\nFirst, I examined the provided text: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\"\n\nThen, I reviewed the criteria of Q4. It's looking for the presence of a rhetorical question that's trying to manufacture a sense of fear, urgency, or concern. I'm thinking of questions like \"Should we be worried?\" or \"Are we safe?\".\n\nNow, I re-read the provided text. It's simply a factual statement, a straightforward report of an event. There is *no* question, rhetorical or otherwise, in the text. It's all declarative.\n\nTherefore, because there's no question, it's impossible for the text to contain a *loaded* rhetorical question. The answer to Q4 is clearly \"no.\""}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text reports a negative fact (HPAI infection) neutrally and does not contain any explicit calming language or cues for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Against Question Q5**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with this text segment: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\" I need to determine if it aligns with the criteria for Reassuring content as defined by Question Q5: *Does it contain an explicit calming cue for reassurance?* I know the Reassuring frame is specifically looking for that.\n\nFirst, I examined the text closely. It reports a negative fact: an HPAI infection. I then cross-referenced it against the Reassuring pattern table and regex. No dice. There are no phrases like \"don't worry,\" \"it's safe,\" or \"everything is under control.\" It's purely factual. There's also no preparedness cue linked to public safety. The language is neutral, stating a confirmed infection without minimizing the severity, but also without offering specific reassurance.\n\nAccording to the Bedrock Principle and the Symmetry Rule, neutrally stated negative facts are considered... well, neutral. They don't fall into the \"alarmist\" category, but they also don't fit the definition of \"reassuring.\" I'm not seeing any explicit attempt to calm concerns or downplay the risk. The text simply presents the information.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the answer to Q5 is \"no.\" The rationale is straightforward: the text reports a negative fact neutrally, and it completely lacks explicit calming language. I'm ready to move on to Q6 now."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'one of its contract farms' but lacks both a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) and an explicit scale contrast ('out of thousands').", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment for Reassurance**\n\nOkay, here's my assessment. The task is to determine if the text segment constitutes reassurance using 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' based on a decision tree's Q6. The segment is: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\"\n\nFirst, I looked for a minimiser like 'only', 'just', etc. The text just says \"a flock at one of its contract farms\", not \"only a flock\". The numeral \"one\" doesn't work as a minimiser.\n\nThen, I checked for a scale contrast. The phrase \"one of its contract farms\" suggests there are multiple farms, but doesn't quantify or contrast it against a larger scale to downplay the significance. It doesn't meet that criterion either.\n\nTherefore, the segment doesn't contain the necessary elements, and my answer to Q6 is \"no\". The rationale: The segment lacks both the required minimiser and explicit scale contrast."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states that HPAI has infected a flock; it does not contain any form of bare negation or statement about the absence of a negative event.", "thoughts": "**Q7 Decision: Proceed to Q8**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment about avian influenza in a Kentucky flock, and the system wants me to analyze it through the lens of Question 7 in this decision tree. My job here is to determine if this segment contains what we call a \"bare negation\" â€“ essentially, language that downplays or dismisses a risk without offering any explicit reassurance.\n\nFirst, I carefully read the provided text: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\"\n\nHmm.  I'm looking for phrases that suggest the absence of something bad, or that downplay the severity of the situation.  Something like, \"This *isn't* expected to spread,\" or \"We've found *no* evidence of transmission.\"  Or maybe a more subtle denial, like, \"The risk is *negligible*.\"  I'm basically looking for a negative assertion without a subsequent calming statement.\n\nBut this segment doesn't contain any of that. It simply states a confirmed fact: HPAI infection has been detected.  There's no negation whatsoever.  It's just a factual statement.\n\nTherefore, because there's no bare negation present, the answer to Q7 is a definitive \"no.\"  We'll move on to the next question in the decision tree (Q8).  My JSON output will reflect this result."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not describe capabilities, preparedness measures, hopeful future possibilities, or implemented safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Q8 Analysis: No Capability/Preparedness Present**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My task is to analyze the text segment \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky\" against Q8 of the 12-step decision tree. This question is looking for descriptions of capabilities, preparedness, or hopeful possibilities, but specifically *without* the element of active reassurance that things are currently calm or safe.\n\nFirst, I need to identify if this segment even *mentions* those things. Does it describe capabilities? No. Does it talk about preparedness measures? Nope. How about hopeful future possibilities or implemented safeguards? Still no. It's simply a factual statement about an infection.\n\nTherefore, since the segment doesn't meet the primary condition of describing capabilities or preparedness, the question of whether it does *so without reassurance* is moot. The premise of the question is not met. It's like asking if a car that doesn't exist is red without saying the color.\n\nThe phrasing of Q8 is a little tricky, but the key is that the segment must contain the descriptions first. Since it doesn't, the answer is \"no\". This means I move on to the next question, Q9, in the decision tree.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, stating a negative fact factually is Neutral. This aligns with the Bedrock Principle and Symmetry Rule. While Q8 is designed to catch specific types of Neutral statements (those about capability/preparedness), this segment doesn't fall into that category. So, my conclusion is that the segment is Neutral. It just states that the infection happened."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a factual event (HPAI infection) and does not contain economic data, prices, or metrics.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating Against Decision Tree Question 9**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\" My task is to determine if this aligns with the criteria for Question 9 in the decision tree. Q9, as I understand it, is specifically looking for text that *primarily* reports prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using standard, descriptive language. No strong verbs, no risk adjectives, nothing that would add a particularly evocative frame.\n\nRight away, I see that this segment doesn't fit that mold. It's reporting a factual event - a confirmed HPAI infection. This isn't about prices, economic indicators, or numbers in the way Q9 defines them. We're dealing with a biological event, the spread of a disease. It's a statement of fact, not an analysis of market fluctuations or statistical trends.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q9 must be \"no\". The rationale is straightforward: the segment isn't reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics as specified by the question's criteria. It's a news report about a disease outbreak."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a current event (infection) and does not contain language speculating about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q10**\n\nOkay, so I need to assess this text segment, specifically \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky,\" against Question Q10 in this decision tree. Q10 is looking for any speculation about future relief or improvement without a clear calming cue about the present.  Essentially, is there any hinting at things getting better soon, or is it just reporting the current situation?\n\nMy understanding is that I'm looking for phrases like \"may be short-lived,\" \"could ease soon,\" anything that suggests a potential recovery or easing of the problem.  I need to be very precise here.\n\nNow, reading the segment: \"Tyson Foods... confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock...\"  This is pretty straightforward. It's a statement of fact, a current negative event.  I'm not seeing any language that even remotely hints at improvement down the line. There's no speculation, no predictions, no projections about the future state of the situation.  No \"maybes,\" no \"couds,\" nothing like that. It's just a simple reporting of a current, confirmed situation.\n\nTherefore, because this segment doesn't contain any language that speculates about future relief or improvement, my answer to Q10 is definitely \"no.\" It's a straight-up factual report.  It's time to move on to the next question, which I presume will be Q11."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "No direct quotes or attributed statements with explicit framing language found in the segment. The confirmation is a factual statement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Decision Tree Q11**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to assess it based on Q11 of the decision tree. The goal here is to determine if there's a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame coming from a directly quoted source. Let me break this down.\n\nThe segment states: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\"\n\nMy initial thought is to identify the source. It's Tyson Foods, specifically a statement from them. Now, I need to see if this statement uses explicit framing language like \"concerning,\" \"alarming,\" \"reassuring,\" or \"under control.\"\n\nLooking closer, the segment says \"confirmed that.\" It's attributed, but it's a statement of *fact*: that HPAI has infected a flock. There's no opinion, no spin, just a confirmation. I see no explicit framing language associated with Tyson Foods.\n\nTherefore, according to the decision tree's definition, this attributed statement from Tyson Foods doesn't provide a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame. It's simply factual. Also, there are no direct quotes present in this segment.\n\nConsequently, since there's no explicitly framed, directly quoted, or attributed statement, Q11 is not met. The answer is \"no.\" My rationale should concisely reflect this: No direct quotes or attributed statements with explicit framing language found in the segment.\n\nI'm ready to output the JSON now."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues found. The segment reports a negative fact (infection) using factual, neutral language ('confirmed that... has infected').", "thoughts": "**My Thought Process: Analyzing the Text for Framing**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with this text snippet from a news report about avian influenza at a Tyson Foods farm. My job is to analyze it *only* for explicit linguistic cues, using the 12-step decision tree, Bedrock Principle, and Symmetry Rule, to determine the framing. As an expert, I'm already quite familiar with this methodology.\n\nI've already processed the text through the first eleven questions of the decision tree, and none of the specific alarmist or reassuring cues triggered a positive response. So, I'm at the default, which is Q12 - the Neutral check.\n\nLet's re-examine this specific sentence against the established rules, assuming I've already scrutinized it thoroughly for Q1-Q11.\n\nFirstly, Q1: there are no intensifiers like \"extremely\" or \"very\" modifying a risk adjective. \"Highly pathogenic\" is part of the disease's official name, not an intentional exaggeration.\n\nSecondly, Q2: the verbs don't describe the *impact*. \"Infected\" is purely factual.\n\nThen, Q3: No moderate verbs coupled with an exaggerated metric.\n\nAnd, Q4: No calming phrases.\n\nQ5, as well as Q6 through Q11, didn't trigger either.\n\nSo, here at Q12, I see a negative fact: the presence of HPAI. But, it's reported very factually. It \"confirmed that... has infected a flock.\" There's no added drama. The language is neutral and objective. The use of \"highly pathogenic\" is not an attempt to scare; it's just part of the official scientific name. This fits perfectly with the description of \"Factual Reporting\" in the Q12 table, the \"Severe Fact, Neutral Presentation\" example.\n\nTherefore, the frame here is clearly Neutral. It's a straight-forward report of a negative fact without any embellishment or overt framing. That is my conclusion, based on my expert knowledge of framing analysis."}
