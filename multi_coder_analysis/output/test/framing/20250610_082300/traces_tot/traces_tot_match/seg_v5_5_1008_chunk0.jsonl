{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes factual impacts (birds killed, cost) but does not use intensifiers or comparatives with risk adjectives.", "thoughts": "**Initial Assessment of Text Segment for Claim Framing**\n\nOkay, I've got this text segment to analyze against the first question of this 12-step decision tree for claim framing, which is my bread and butter. The task is to see if there's an intensifier or a comparative adjective directly modifying a risk adjective. Essentially, we're looking for phrases like \"so deadly,\" \"very dangerous,\" or \"more severe.\"\n\nHere's the segment: \"In 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\"\n\nLet's break this down. First, we have \"50 million birds across 15 states were killed.\"  This is a straight-up factual statement about the scale and impact of the event. No intensifying language or risk-laden adjectives there.  Then, \"due to an outbreak\" simply states the cause, still without the required pattern. Finally, \"costing the federal government nearly $1 billion\" presents another fact - the cost - without any intensification of the risk.\n\nSo, while the segment clearly describes significant negative facts – mass bird deaths and a substantial financial cost – it does so in a matter-of-fact way. There's no use of intensifying language or comparative risk adjectives here. Therefore, my answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" The segment doesn't contain the pattern we're looking for. The impact is significant, yes, but it isn't framed using the specific elements that Q1 requires."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the factual verb 'were killed' and states the cost, but lacks high-potency verbs, metaphors, superlatives, or critical alert phrases required by Q2.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Q2: A Deep Dive into Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a sentence and tasked with evaluating it against Q2 of the decision tree. Q2 is all about spotting alarming framing – the kind of language that amps up the situation beyond a simple factual description. My mind immediately goes through the checklist: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, and that red flag phrase, \"on high alert.\"\n\nThe text in question is: \"In 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\"\n\nFirst, I hone in on \"were killed.\" Is that a high-potency verb *in this context*? The list I'm working with includes \"slaughtered,\" which is clearly meant to evoke a strong emotional response. \"Killed\" is factual, direct. It states the outcome, but does it *frame* it alarmingly? The goal here is to identify language that actively amplifies the event's severity beyond the baseline facts. The Bedrock Principle is key here: We're coding the *presentation*, not just the facts. A severe fact presented neutrally is still *neutral*.\n\nThen, I look at the phrase \"costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\" That's a huge number, but it's presented without any loaded verbs like \"crippling\" or \"devastating.\" It's just a statement of fact.\n\nSo, I re-examine the Q2 patterns. \"Ravaged\" is in the high-potency list. \"Slaughtered\" is in the high-potency list. But \"killed\" is not.\n\nComparing \"killed\" to examples like \"ravaged\" or \"slaughtered\", \"killed\" is a more direct and less emotionally charged factual description. It’s the standard term for causing death. It's a statement of fact, a neutral rendering.\n\nTherefore, \"were killed\" doesn't fit the criteria for a high-potency verb that actively frames the situation in an alarming way, according to the provided rules. No other Q2 cues are present. So, the answer to Q2 is a firm \"no.\" We move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'were killed' is a plain factual outcome verb, not one of the specified 'moderate verbs' required for Q3 to fire, despite the presence of scale information.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Question Q3 of the 12-Step Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment: \"In 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\" My task is to see if it triggers Question Q3, which looks for 'moderate verbs' paired with significant scale or impact.  Q3 is all about identifying Alarmist framing.\n\nFirst, I need to check the verb. The text uses \"were killed.\"  Now, I'm pretty familiar with the rules here.  I know that Q3 specifically *excludes* plain factual outcome verbs like \"killed,\" \"died,\" \"affected,\" etc.  It's very clear in the documentation.  And when I check my mental regex pattern of acceptable verbs from my understanding of the rules, \"killed\" isn't on the list.\n\nNow, even though this segment *does* have significant scale information – \"50 million birds,\" \"15 states,\" and \"nearly $1 billion\" - the *key* here is that the verb itself doesn't fit the criteria. The presence of impact doesn't automatically trigger Q3; it *needs* a specific type of verb.  It's the *combination* of the two that matters.\n\nSince \"were killed\" is a simple, factual verb, not a \"moderate verb\" as defined by Q3, this segment doesn't meet the condition. If it had been \"prompted\" or \"surged,\" *then* it would be a different story. But it's not.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q3 has to be \"no.\" The rationale is straightforward: while the text contains impact information, the crucial element, a \"moderate verb,\" is missing. The verb \"were killed\" is a plain factual description of an outcome, which does not trigger Q3. This situation is considered neutral as per the rules."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment provides factual information about a past event and does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and need to evaluate it against Q4 of this decision tree. Q4's looking for loaded rhetorical questions, specifically those designed to provoke alarm.  Let's see... the text states, \"In 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\"\n\nRight away, I see this is a straightforward statement of factual events: a past outbreak, casualties, and associated costs.  There's no question being posed, not even a rhetorical one.  There's no attempt to frame the information in a way that *implies* alarm through questioning. It’s just presenting the data. Therefore, it does not meet the necessary criteria. My assessment? It’s a clear \"no\". There's no loaded rhetorical question here."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports historical negative facts (birds killed, cost) and contains no explicit language or cues designed to calm concerns or communicate current safety or control.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Q5**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text: \"In 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\"  My task is to determine if this segment satisfies Q5 of the decision tree. Q5, as I understand it, is all about spotting explicit calming cues—those direct statements that reassure the reader about safety, control, or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is, this is pretty straightforward. The segment is a factual statement about a past event, a large-scale bird kill.  It presents the negative consequences – both in terms of animal lives and financial cost – without framing them in a way that suggests current safety or control. There's no language here that explicitly tells me, or anyone, not to worry.\n\nI've got that Q5 pattern recognition table and the regex in mind. I'm checking for phrases like \"don't panic,\" \"no reason to fear,\" \"completely safe,\" or anything that directly communicates reassurance.  I'm also looking for similar sentiment using the regex.  This segment doesn't contain any of those calming patterns. It simply details a historical incident.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q5 is a definitive \"no.\" My rationale would be clear: the segment presents a factual account of a past negative event (the outbreak) and its associated costs without employing any explicit language or rhetorical strategies designed to calm concerns or emphasize current safety or minimized risk. There's no attempt to reassure the reader with those specific calming cues we're looking for."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment provides large numbers (50 million birds, 15 states, $1 billion) without using any minimiser words or scale contrast for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Reassurance through Minimiser and Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and need to assess it against Q6 of this decision tree, specifically looking for that 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' combination used to offer reassurance.  The segment is about a bird flu outbreak in 2015 - fifty million birds, fifteen states, and nearly a billion dollars.\n\nMy initial thought is to break down the elements. First, I need to identify a minimiser word - \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" something like that. Then, I need to see if there's a scale contrast, perhaps like \"out of X,\" or \"nationwide,\" showing how this downplays a larger context.\n\nLet's dive in: \"50 million birds\" – that's a *lot* of birds, definitely not a minimiser. \"Across 15 states\" indicates a scope, but it's not working with a minimiser. Lastly, \"nearly $1 billion\" - a massive financial impact, not a minimiser either.\n\nHmm... all the numbers are presented factually. There's nothing like \"only 50 million,\" or \"just 15 states,\" to diminish the scale. The language is purely descriptive.\n\nSo, concluding that there's no evidence of the 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' pattern. My answer to Q6 has to be \"no.\" The segment describes a significant event, but it doesn't try to downplay it using the specific technique the decision tree is looking for. The rationale is quite straightforward - there are simply no minimiser words used in conjunction with a scale contrast."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a past event and its consequences; it does not contain any form of bare negation or statement about something not happening or not being a risk.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for \"Bare Negation\" in the Provided Text**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with a text segment: \"In 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\" My task is to scrutinize this passage against Question 7 of the decision tree, which is essentially looking for what we might call \"bare negation\" – a statement that uses a direct negation without an associated calming cue.\n\nLet's break this down. Question 7, as I understand it, is fishing for things like: \"it's *not* expected to cause problems\", \"unlikely to affect X\", \"no human cases detected\", \"tests were negative\", \"do not present an immediate public-health concern\", \"will not enter the food system\" – you know, phrases that explicitly tell us something *didn't* or *won't* happen. These are the kinds of phrases that alert us to potential misinterpretations and require careful assessment of the context and the potential calming cues.\n\nNow, looking at this sentence, it's pretty straightforward. It's a statement of fact about a past event. It’s quantifying the negative impact of an outbreak: a large number of fatalities and a significant financial cost. But it doesn't contain any of those negative constructions. I don't see any \"not,\" \"no,\" \"unlikely,\" \"cannot,\" \"do not,\" or anything similar. There's nothing about what *didn't* happen or what's *not* a risk.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the provided text segment does *not* contain a \"bare negation.\" That means the answer to Question 7 is definitely \"no.\" And based on the decision tree's logic, a \"no\" answer tells me to proceed to the next question, which I'll be ready for. My JSON output will reflect this \"no\" with a clear and concise explanation of my reasoning."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a past event and its consequences, not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q8**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment: \"In 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\" And I need to assess whether it relates to Question Q8 of the decision tree. Q8 is looking for language around capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, *without* explicitly linking them to current calm, safety, or minimized risk.\n\nRight off the bat, I recognize this segment describes a *past* event: a really devastating outbreak that occurred in 2015. It tells me about the scale of the damage (50 million birds dead, widespread across states, a huge cost). But I don't see any language signaling response efforts, proactive measures, or future considerations, such as a vaccine effort.\n\nMy immediate impression is that this is simply a historical account of a negative outcome. It *doesn't* suggest ongoing containment measures, potential vaccine development, established systems or protocols, plans for prevention, measures to safeguard against another event, or any focus on recovery. It’s purely descriptive.\n\nSince Q8 is specifically looking for *those* kinds of proactive concepts, the segment definitely doesn’t fit. This is not about capabilities or preparedness at all. It's a statement of fact about past losses. Therefore, I'm confident in saying the answer to Q8 is \"no.\" This takes me to the next question, Q9, but the prompt only asks for Q8, so that’s it."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports the economic cost ('costing the federal government nearly $1 billion') using a standard descriptive verb ('costing') without vivid verbs or risk adjectives.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Decision Tree Q9**\n\nOkay, here's my assessment of that text segment, as requested. I need to determine if it's factual price/metric reporting using neutral language, as defined in Q9 of the decision tree.\n\nThe segment states: \"In 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\"\n\nI immediately focus on the \"costing $1 billion\" part. Q9 is specifically about reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics, and that's precisely what we have here: a reported economic cost.\n\nNow, let's dissect the language: The metric is \"nearly $1 billion.\" The verb used is \"costing,\" which is a perfectly standard and neutral verb for describing an economic expense. There's no dramatic language, no \"skyrocketing\" or \"plummeting.\" No risk adjectives are present. The author's tone is strictly informational regarding the economic impact.\n\nTherefore, this aligns perfectly with the criteria for Neutral reporting under Q9. The key here is the factual reporting of the cost using that standard, non-emotive verb \"costing.\" I'd confidently answer \"Yes\" to Q9 in this case."}
