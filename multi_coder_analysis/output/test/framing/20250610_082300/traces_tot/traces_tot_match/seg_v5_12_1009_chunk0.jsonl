{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'highly' modifying the risk-adjective 'lethal'.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Alarmist Detected**\n\nOkay, so I'm analyzing this text snippet according to the decision tree, specifically checking against Q1. The user's given me: \"They [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentuckyâ€™s first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\"\n\nRight off the bat, I see \"highly lethal bird flu.\" My primary concern here is if there's an intensifier modifying a risk-adjective.  \"Highly\" is clearly an intensifier, and \"lethal\" is *definitely* a risk-adjective.  I know, from my expertise, that \"lethal\" qualifies within the Q1 rules.\n\nThis fits the pattern perfectly: \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj\". It's a textbook example of what Q1 is looking for, and they even use \"highly lethal\" as an example! I considered the \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\" technical term context, but the text specifically uses \"highly lethal,\" and the rule explicitly highlights \"lethal\".\n\nSo, the answer to Q1 is a resounding yes. The decisive cue that triggered my alarm bells is, undeniably, \"highly lethal\". I'm stopping here and emitting the Alarmist frame, as per the protocol."}
