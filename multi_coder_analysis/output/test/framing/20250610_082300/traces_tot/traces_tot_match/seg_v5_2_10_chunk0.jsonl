{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'highly pathogenic strain' is treated as a technical term for the disease type, not an authorial intensifier modifying a general risk-adjective, per the technical-term guard rule.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment Against Q1 of the 12-Step Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment and I need to determine if it triggers Q1 of the 12-step decision tree. My goal is to find an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective, adhering strictly to the Bedrock Principle and the Symmetry Rule. The text is: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\"\n\nI'm looking for the pattern: `(intensifier/comparative) + (risk-adjective)`.  I've got my list of risk adjectives and intensifiers/comparatives ready to go.\n\nScanning the text, I immediately spot \"highly pathogenic\".  But, aha! The \"Technical-term guard\" kicks in. The rules explicitly state that \"highly pathogenic\" is considered **Neutral** when used as part of the formal disease name, like HPAI, unless additional alarmist cues are present. My regex pattern also includes a clever negative lookahead to prevent this specific pattern from triggering a positive response.\n\nIn this context, \"highly pathogenic\" is describing the *strain* of avian influenza, not functioning as an authorial intensifier of a generic risk adjective.  It's part of the technical medical terminology.  Therefore, it *does not* satisfy the conditions of Q1.\n\nMy analysis leads to a \"no\" answer for Q1.  I'll proceed to Q2, although that's not specified here."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or the phrase 'on high alert' framing the event alarmingly. 'Highly pathogenic' describes the virus factually.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment and I'm running it against Q2 of the decision tree. My task is to determine if this segment employs any alarmist framing techniques. Let's see...\n\nI'm looking for those high-potency verbs, like \"devastated\" or \"erupted,\" which are designed to immediately grab your attention and suggest a crisis. Then, I'll be on the lookout for potent metaphors that paint a picture of impending doom. And of course, I'm checking for those superlative negative noun combos (\"worst disaster\") and the classic \"on high alert\" phrase.\n\nScanning the text, I see verbs like \"came,\" \"ordering,\" \"kept,\" \"confirmed,\" and \"found.\" While these verbs are certainly descriptive, none of them carry the weight or the emotional charge of those high-potency verbs I'm trained to identify. They're more factual than fear-inducing.\n\nNo metaphors jump out at me either. Nothing like \"a wildfire spreading through the community\" or \"a tsunami of infection.\" The language is fairly straightforward.\n\nAnd the search for superlative negative nouns? Nada. No \"worst\" anything or \"most devastating\" situations.\n\nFinally, \"on high alert\"? Nope, not present.\n\nThe only potentially \"negative\" element is the phrase \"highly pathogenic strain.\" However, based on the Bedrock Principle and the Symmetry Rule, describing the nature of the virus, even if it's severe, isn't inherently alarmist. It's a technical description. I'm coding the presentation, not the facts themselves. It's not amplifying the *impact* or *spread* using vivid language. Therefore, it's neutral.\n\nSo, according to my expert understanding of Q2 and the relevant principles, the answer is a clear \"no.\" This segment doesn't actively frame the situation alarmingly using the specified techniques. I'm ready to move on to Q3."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified 'moderate verbs' paired with scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Framing (Q3)**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my analysis. First, I have the text segment, which I carefully read. My task is to see if it triggers an \"Alarmist\" frame based on Question 3 of the decision tree. Q3 looks for 'moderate verbs' along with information about 'significant scale or impact.'\n\nI scanned the text, focusing on the verbs. I used the approved list and regex of \"moderate verbs\" to compare. I was looking for things like \"hit,\" \"swept,\" or \"plunged,\" but none of those verbs were present in the text segment. I specifically noted \"came,\" \"ordering,\" \"kept,\" \"confirmed,\" and \"found,\" but these are not the verbs I was looking for.\n\nI also checked to see if it mentioned anything to do with culling (like \"euthanasia,\" \"depopulation,\" etc.), but this was not found either.  Since the text doesn't contain a moderate verb from the approved list, it doesn't meet the criteria for Q3. Therefore, the answer to Q3 is \"no.\" I'm now ready to proceed to the next stage in the decision tree."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text segment contains no questions, rhetorical or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Decision Tree Q4**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with checking this text segment against Q4 of a decision tree. Q4's looking specifically for loaded rhetorical questions that are crafted to evoke a sense of alarm. My initial approach is to simply read the text and see if any questions, especially of that loaded rhetorical nature, are present.\n\nThe text is: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\"\n\nUpon review, it's clear this is a straightforward declarative statement. It describes an outbreak, actions taken in response (a government order and subsequent findings from tests), and the context of those events. There are absolutely no questions, rhetorical or otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q4 is definitively \"no\". I'll structure my response as a JSON object, clearly indicating the answer and the rationale I just walked through."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative event (outbreak) and a negative fact (highly pathogenic strain) but contains no explicit language from the author or a source designed to calm concerns or assure current safety.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text snippet and need to determine if it uses any explicit calming cues, according to the Q5 criteria. That means I'm searching for phrases that directly reassure the reader about safety, control, or minimized risk. Things like \"no need to worry,\" \"situation is contained,\" \"risk is minimal,\" that kind of thing.\n\nReading the provided segment, the initial impression is negative. We're talking about an outbreak *despite* preventative measures, and a \"highly pathogenic strain\" of avian influenza. My internal scan is specifically tuned for those calming phrases. I'm not seeing them.\n\nThe government ordering birds indoors is a preparedness measure, not a statement of *current* safety. It doesn't tell us the situation is under control now that the outbreak has happened. It describes preventative measures, not a current state of security and control. The mention of a \"highly pathogenic strain\" is also obviously cause for concern, not reassurance.\n\nTherefore, considering the absence of those specific calming cues I'm looking for, my conclusion is clear: This text segment does not meet the Q5 criteria. My answer is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'two dead wild swans' but lacks both a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) and a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'among millions') required for this rule.", "thoughts": "**Q6 Evaluation: Minimiser + Scale Contrast for Reassurance**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to see if the provided text segment exhibits the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern relevant to Reassurance, as defined by Q6.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the segment: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\"\n\nNow, let's look for the key elements. The text mentions \"two dead wild swans.\" That's the specific event we're focusing on in this case.\n\nNext, I have to check for a *minimiser*. According to the guidelines, this means looking for words that diminish the perceived magnitude, like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"a few.\"  While the number \"two\" is present, it's not preceded by any of these minimisers. The text simply states \"two dead wild swans.\" The bare numeral, by itself, doesn't qualify as a minimiser in this context.\n\nThen, I need to check for a *scale contrast*.  This would involve comparing the specific event (the swans) to a larger context, something like \"out of millions\" or \"nationwide.\" But there's nothing in the text that provides such a contrasting scale.  It just describes the incident's immediate location: a village near Utrecht.\n\nSince I don't see either a minimiser *or* a scale contrast operating to downplay the significance of the event in conjunction with each other, I have to conclude that the 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' pattern is not present. Therefore, the answer to Q6 is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any bare negation phrases like 'not expected', 'unlikely', 'no evidence', 'tests were negative', or similar.", "thoughts": "**Q7 Evaluation: Absence of Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, here's my assessment. The user presented me with a text segment and asked me to evaluate it against Decision Tree Question 7, which focuses on identifying \"bare negations\" without any explicit calming cues. Essentially, it's asking if the text downplays a risk without providing any actual reassurance.\n\nLet's break it down as I see it. The text starts with a contrast: \"The outbreak came despite...\" This immediately implies that something happened even though a preventative measure was taken. The rest of the segment describes that measure (keeping birds indoors) and the context: the confirmation of a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain in wild swans.\n\nI'm specifically on the lookout for phrases that directly negate or minimize a risk, like saying \"it's not expected to cause problems\" or \"no human cases detected.\" I'm not seeing anything that fits that pattern here. The phrase \"The outbreak came despite...\" could *feel* concerning, but it's not a direct negation. It's simply stating a fact: an outbreak happened even though something was done to prevent it. I don't see any other phrases in the segment that attempt to deny or minimize the risk of the outbreak or the confirmed strain.\n\nSo, according to my understanding of Q7, this segment doesn't contain a bare negation. The answer, therefore, is \"no.\" This means I'll need to move on to the next question in the decision tree (Q8).\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment does not contain any phrases that downplay or negate a risk or problem factually without an explicit calming cue, as defined by Q7. It contrasts an outbreak with a preventative measure and provides context for a confirmed highly pathogenic strain.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Describes a preparedness measure ('ordering all birds... to be kept indoors') factually without explicit language linking it to current calm or safety.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Q8 Compliance: Capability/Preparedness without Active Reassurance**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text snippet: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\" I need to determine if it aligns with Q8 – are we looking at a statement about capability or preparedness *without* active reassurance?\n\nFirst, I identify the preparedness element. Hmm, it looks like \"ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors\" is the key. That's clearly a measure taken by the government, a preventative step. Now, the crucial part: does the text then *reassure* the audience by saying this action guarantees safety or downplays present risk? No. In fact, the text immediately undercuts the effectiveness of the measure by stating the outbreak happened *despite* it. This suggests the action didn't fully work or wasn't enough to prevent the spread. There's no \"we're safe now,\" no \"don't worry,\" just a factual statement of an action followed by its seemingly limited effect.\n\nThis aligns perfectly with Q8. We see a capability being stated—the government's ability to order a lockdown—but it's presented factually, not as a reason to feel safe *right now*. There's no attempt to actively reassure the reader that risk has been eliminated or significantly reduced. So, yes, it satisfies the criteria of Q8.\n\nTherefore, the `answer` should be \"yes\", and the `rationale` would quote the relevant part: \"ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors\", and clarify that it's a measure presented factually without any present-tense reassurance language about safety."}
