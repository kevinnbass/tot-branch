{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment for Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and the first question in the decision tree: does it contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective? I quickly scan the text: \"The virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\" Right away, I see \"so contagious.\"  Now, \"so\" is definitely an intensifier, and \"contagious\" is absolutely a risk-adjective, just like I'd expect. It fits the pattern I'm looking for: *intensifier + risk-adjective*. That's the cue I need.\n\nThere's no need to go any further down the tree. The presence of that combination means the answer to Q1 is a resounding \"yes.\" This automatically flags the text with an Alarmist frame. My output will reflect this, citing \"so contagious\" as the evidence for the Alarmist classification, and my analysis is complete."}
