{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: A Clear \"No\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"  The task is to see if it meets the criteria of Q1 in the decision tree. Specifically, I need to check for an intensifier or comparative adjective *directly* modifying a risk-adjective.  I'm looking for patterns like \"very dangerous\" or \"more deadly.\"\n\nLet's break it down: \"Last week\" is just a time reference, no issue there.  The part about China and Korea limiting purchases is a factual statement about action taken; neutral. The phrase \"due to an outbreak\" is simply a statement of cause. And, the \"at a commercial turkey farm there\" is just location information - purely descriptive.\n\nThe text mentions an \"outbreak,\" which is negative, yes, but it doesn't give me any *qualifiers* of that. It doesn't tell me *how* dangerous, or *how* severe.  There are no intensifiers like \"so\" or \"very,\" and no comparative adjectives like \"more\" or \"less.\" There aren't even any risk-adjectives like \"deadly\" or \"dangerous\" to be intensified in the first place!\n\nTherefore, the required pattern isn't present. My conclusion is a clear \"no\" for Q1.  The text segment doesn't contain the specific combination of intensifier/comparative adjective *and* risk-adjective that I'm looking for."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses factual language ('limited', 'outbreak') without high-potency verbs, metaphors, or other Q2 framing cues.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text for Q2 Triggers**\n\nOkay, so I need to check this segment against the Q2 criteria, specifically looking for those red flags – the high-potency verbs, impactful metaphors, superlatives paired with negative nouns, or that \"on high alert\" phrasing. I'm focusing on \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nRight off the bat, I see \"limited.\" While it's a consequence, a clear result of the situation, it's not a verb like \"ravaged\" or \"decimated\" that actively works to alarm or frame the events negatively.  \"Outbreak\" is the event itself - it's factual, not a framing verb. I'm also not seeing any metaphors or superlative + negative combinations.  No signs of the \"on high alert\" phrase either.\n\nThe verb choice is crucial here. \"Limited\" is a factual representation. Given the available context, it's a pragmatic and precise descriptor. No Q2 cues present.  My response will be \"no\" for Q2. I'm ready to move on."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and tasked with evaluating it against Question 3 of the decision tree. My goal here is to determine if the segment triggers an \"Alarmist\" frame. Question 3 specifically looks for a combination of \"moderate verbs\" (as defined by their regex) and information about \"significant scale or impact.\"\n\nI need to meticulously examine the segment for those key elements. Here's what I found: the relevant sentence is: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nFirst, I identified the verbs in the segment. I spotted \"limited\" and then \"outbreak,\" which is a noun. Now, I need to check these verbs against the Q3 regex, which is my critical checklist. The acceptable verbs are: `hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|(?:were|was)\\s+culled`. Neither \"limited\" nor \"outbreak\" matches this regex.\n\nTherefore, since the segment lacks the necessary \"moderate verbs\" from the defined list, I can definitively conclude that the condition for Question 3 is **not** met. There's no need to analyze the scale or impact, as the critical first criterion (presence of a moderate verb) wasn't satisfied."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no questions, therefore no loaded rhetorical questions.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to apply my expertise to evaluate this text against Q4, specifically looking for those loaded rhetorical questions that try to whip up alarm. Let's see...\n\nFirst, I need to understand the segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" Simple enough. It's a factual statement reporting an event: *buyers limited purchases*. No editorializing here, just the facts.\n\nNow, Q4. Right, the goal is to identify those loaded questions designed to provoke fear or urgency. Think along the lines of, \"Are we doomed?!\" or \"What are they hiding?!\" Not neutral questions, but questions loaded with implied concern.\n\nLooking at the segment again, I don't see any questions. At all. Not a single interrogative sentence. This makes the answer a straightforward \"no,\" as Q4 requires the presence of such questions.\n\nTherefore, the only thing left to do is justify my finding. Let's put this into JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment does not contain any questions, therefore it cannot contain loaded rhetorical questions implying alarm.\"\n}\n```\nDone. My analysis is complete."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative event (outbreak) and its consequence (limited purchases) factually, without using explicit calming language or framing the situation for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text for Q5**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a short news segment, and my task is to determine if it explicitly contains any calming cues as per Q5. That means I need to scan for phrases directly designed to reassure the public about their safety, control of the situation, or minimized risk. Think \"no worries,\" \"everything's under control,\" that sort of thing.\n\nThe text describes a situation: a poultry outbreak in Indiana and subsequent purchase limits from China and Korea. It's a factual statement; a negative event and its economic impact. But the crucial thing is, it's presented neutrally. I'm not seeing any language *specifically* intended to soothe anxieties or downplay the seriousness. No assurances, no calls to remain calm, nothing along those lines. The author simply relays the information.\n\nTherefore, applying my expertise, I've got to conclude that the answer is definitively \"no\" for Q5. There are no such calming cues present."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm' but lacks both a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) and a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'among millions').", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Provided Text Regarding Reassurance Pattern \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" (Q6)**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this, keeping my expertise in mind. The user wants me to assess a text segment for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern, which is part of the Reassurance strategy. This means I'm looking for two specific components working together: words that minimize the impact of something (like \"only\" or \"a few\") *and* a contrast that puts the event in a broader scale (like \"out of millions\").\n\nFirst, I examined the text: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" My initial focus was on the language used to describe the event and the farm.\n\nI systematically looked for any minimizers, those linguistic signals that downplay the severity, scale, or scope. Words like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few\" would be red flags here.  Unfortunately, the text doesn't use *any* of those. It simply states \"an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm.\"\n\nThen, I looked for the scale contrast. Was the outbreak positioned within a larger framework, something that would provide perspective?  Did it say, for instance, \"among millions of birds\" or \"out of thousands of farms\"? Again, there's no larger context provided. We're just told it happened \"at a commercial turkey farm\" in Indiana.\n\nSince the rule requires *both* a minimizer *and* a scale contrast working in concert to downplay the event, and I didn't find either element present, my conclusion is that the segment does *not* exhibit the desired pattern.  Therefore, the answer to Q6 is \"no.\"  I'm ready to proceed with the JSON construction, knowing that the prompt only requires the Q6 answer."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a negative event (outbreak) and its consequence (limited purchases) but contains no bare negation about the risk, severity, or impact."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a past event (outbreak) and its consequence (limited purchases), not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Question Q8**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" My task is to determine if this aligns with Question Q8, specifically looking for descriptions of capabilities or preparedness *without* any active reassurance.\n\nMy first instinct is to scan for the typical keywords Q8 targets: things like *officials, vaccine, system, plan, protocol, measure, safeguard, capability, prepare, develop, implement, work, contain*.  A quick glance doesn't reveal any of those. The segment focuses on the *consequence* of an outbreak: limited purchases. It's a factual report about what happened *after* an event, not a description of proactive measures or capabilities.\n\nThe core of Q8 hinges on identifying descriptions of capability or preparedness. This segment simply doesn't contain that *type* of content. It details a problem and its effect, not the response or proactive measures to it. Therefore, since the segment doesn't meet the premise of the question, my initial assessment points towards a \"no\" answer.\n\nI need to confirm this. I revisit the examples provided for Q8. They showcase actions or statements related to managing a situation, like \"officials are working\", \"vaccine can be made\", etc. The segment doesn't resemble any of those examples. It's a report of a negative event, not a discussion of responses or safeguards.\n\nEssentially, Q8 is asking if the segment describes \"this *type* of thing\" (capabilities/preparedness). It doesn't. Therefore, the answer is \"no\". This segment does *not* contain a \"Capability/Preparedness Statement without Active Reassurance\". It's simply a factual news report."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes buyers limiting purchases due to an event, but does not report specific prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using standard or vivid economic verbs.", "thoughts": "**Evaluation of Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question 9**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this text segment in relation to Question 9:\n\nI've been asked to assess if the phrase \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there\" constitutes a primary report of prices, economic data, or numerical metrics as defined by Q9. I need to focus on whether it's conveying that information using the specific type of language Q9 is looking for: standard descriptive verbs and potentially neutral adverbs *without* any vivid or potent verbs, risk adjectives, or explicit framing.\n\nReading the segment, I see it focuses on buyers *limiting* purchases due to an outbreak. While this clearly relates to economic activity (specifically, the poultry market), it's not a direct presentation of prices, economic data points, or numerical metrics themselves. The verbs used (\"limited\") and the context deal with a consequence of a situation, not the *presentation* of the data as the question intends. I'm not seeing any of the verb patterns or examples Q9 describes, like \"prices rose,\" \"costs declined,\" or any similar descriptive report of data change.\n\nMy conclusion is clear: This segment does *not* fit the description of primarily reporting prices, economic data, or metrics using the verb types specified in Q9. Therefore, my answer will be \"no.\""}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a past event and its consequence; it does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and need to assess it based on Decision Tree Q10.  This is a straightforward task, really. Q10 hinges on whether the segment speculates about *future* relief or improvement *without* also explicitly acknowledging the *present* state. If it does, it's Neutral; otherwise, I move on.\n\nThe segment reads: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" My initial thought is to identify any language that even hints at a potential future change for the better.\n\nLet's break it down. We're looking at a past event – last week.  We have buyers limiting purchases due to an outbreak.  The outbreak itself is the negative event.  But I'm not seeing any speculation about when things will get *better*. There's no talk of when the outbreak might end, when the purchase limitations will lift, or when the situation will improve.\n\nI'm mentally running through the patterns I'd be looking for: Future Relief Speculation, Hopeful Predictions, Timeline Speculation.  Nothing. No \"may,\" \"might,\" or \"could\" suggesting a future possibility. No \"expect,\" \"predict,\" or \"forecast.\"  Definitely no \"hope for\" or \"optimistic about.\" And absolutely no mention of any timetable or end point.\n\nSo, according to Q10's criteria, this segment *doesn't* speculate about future relief or improvement. The focus is purely on the past event and its impact.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q10 is a definitive \"no\".  The segment describes the past; it does not predict the future. Since the instructions say to proceed to the next hop if no, but only Q10 is asked for, I should only provide the answer to Q10 with a rationale."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any direct quotations or attributed statements with explicit framing language.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Dominant Framed Quotation (Q11)**\n\nOkay, so I need to check this segment against Q11, specifically looking for a dominant framed quotation.  My initial scan immediately looks for direct quotes or attributions to sources.  The segment provided, \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there,\" doesn't have any quotation marks or phrases like \"[Source Name] said...\" or anything similar.  \n\nNext, I need to see if there's *implicit* framing within the narrative itself, even without direct quotes.  The text describes actions (\"limited purchases\") and a situation (\"outbreak\").  While those are important events, they are reported as facts. There's nothing like \"This is a disaster!\" or \"Don't worry, it's under control!\" that's clearly attributed to a source. There's no attempt to push a particular alarmist or reassuring perspective here, just a report of what happened.\n\nTherefore, because there's no direct quotation or clear, attributed framing language, I have to answer \"no\" to Q11.  I'll now move on to the next question, which I know is Q12."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports factual events (limited purchases, outbreak) using neutral, descriptive language without explicit alarmist or reassuring framing cues.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Provided Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to apply the Q12 rule from the decision tree to this text: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nMy first thought is to dissect this based on my understanding of the Q12 criteria. That rule is the \"default to Neutral\" check, meaning I'm looking for the *absence* of framing cues, either alarmist or reassuring. It's essentially a sanity check for a factual presentation.\n\nLet's break it down: \"Last week\" is a simple temporal reference, so it's neutral. \"Buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana\" describes an action. The key word here is \"limited.\" It's factual; there's no exaggeration or emotional spin. \"Due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there\" provides the reason. \"Outbreak\" is a factual term, describing a negative event, yes, but it doesn't use any intensifiers or vivid language to amplify the situation.\n\nNow, let's rigorously test against Q12: Are there any explicit alarmist cues like intensifiers, vivid verbs, or loaded metaphors? No, \"limited\" and \"outbreak\" are standard terms. And reassuring cues? Absolutely none. Is it purely factual and descriptive? Absolutely. It's simply reporting the event and its cause.\n\nThe segment reports negative information, an outbreak and its consequence, *neutrally*. This aligns perfectly with the definition of a Neutral frame, where potentially severe facts are presented without loaded language or rhetorical embellishment.\n\nSo, according to my expert judgment, the answer to Q12 is a resounding \"yes.\" The frame is, by default, Neutral. My reasoning boils down to the fact that the segment presents the facts using neutral, descriptive language, lacking any explicit framing cues that would push it toward either Alarmist or Reassuring."}
