{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'most expensive' to describe the financial cost, not an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective like 'deadly' or 'severe' as defined for Q1."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The phrase \"most expensive animal health disaster\" uses a superlative + negative noun pattern, explicitly listed as an Alarmist cue under Q2.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Against Q2 of the 12-Step Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, I've been tasked with analyzing this text segment: \"The outbreaks were deemed the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history, costing the government nearly $1 billion for removal and disposal of infected birds and government indemnity payments to producers for the lost birds.\" I need to determine if it triggers the \"Alarmist\" frame based on the criteria in Q2 of the decision tree. As a seasoned professional, I know this involves looking for specific patterns: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative noun combinations, and critical alert phrases.\n\nFirst, I scanned the text for any obvious high-potency verbs like \"ravaged\" or \"crippling,\" but didn't find any. Similarly, no potent metaphors, such as a \"ticking time-bomb,\" were present. No critical alert phrases jumped out either. However, my attention was immediately drawn to the phrase \"most expensive animal health disaster.\" This, I recognized, perfectly fits the \"Superlative + Negative Noun\" pattern defined in the Q2 guidelines. I cross-referenced this against the explicit regular expression and confirmed it matches the pattern: `(?:most|record(?:-breaking)?|worst)\\s+\\w{0,12}?\\s+(?:disaster|crisis|outbreak|catastrophe|calamity)`. The \"most expensive...disaster\" clearly triggers this rule.\n\nGiven this definitive match, the answer to Q2 is unequivocally \"yes.\" The presence of the \"most expensive animal health disaster\" phrase is a clear indicator of the Alarmist frame. As the decision tree dictates, a \"yes\" answer to Q2 immediately leads to emitting the Alarmist frame. Therefore, my analysis is complete."}
