{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains economic terms ('burden', 'onerous') but no intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective from the specified list (deadly, dangerous, severe, etc.).", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and the task is to run it against Q1 of this 12-step decision tree for claim framing. Essentially, I need to check if there's an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. My expertise tells me this is about identifying potential bias in how risk is communicated.\n\nI'm on the lookout for phrases like \"so deadly,\" \"more dangerous,\" or \"very severe\" – the typical hallmarks of this kind of framing. Let's dig into the segment: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"\n\nBreaking it down, \"eventual scale\" and \"subsequent euthanizations\" are pretty neutral descriptions of the events.  Then, we have \"impose a burden on consumers' wallets.\" While \"burden\" is negative, it's about the economic consequence, not directly linked to the inherent risk or severity of the H5N1 outbreak itself. The same goes for \"already-onerous costs of poultry.\" \"Onerous\" is negative, but it modifies \"costs,\" not a risk-adjective from the established list. It highlights an existing economic burden, not intensifying the risk of the outbreak.\n\nSo, scanning the whole segment, I don't see any of the classic \"Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective\" patterns I'm looking for. The negative terms present focus on *economic* impact, not the *inherent* risk of the disease as Q1 defines it.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion, given this nuanced assessment, is a resounding \"no\" for Q1."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses phrases like 'impose a burden' and 'already-onerous costs', but these do not meet the criteria for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other specific patterns listed in Q2.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Segment Against Q2 of the Claim Framing Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, so I'm analyzing this text snippet against the criteria for Q2 of the 12-step decision tree, which is all about spotting alarmist language. I need to look for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert\" (with a threat keyword). The segment is: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"\n\nFirst, I scanned for those high-potency verbs, and initially, \"impose a burden\" and \"adding to\" stood out. However, on closer examination, neither phrase quite fits the bill. The examples of high-potency verbs in the Q2 table – things like \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" \"skyrocketed\" – are much more impactful. \"Impose a burden\" is more descriptive, hinting at a potential negative consequence, but it's not the same level of vividness. \"Adding to\" is even more neutral.\n\nNext, I looked for any potent metaphors or superlative + negative noun pairings. Nothing jumped out at me. And, of course, the \"on high alert\" phrase isn't present.\n\nThe phrase \"already-onerous costs\" caught my eye. \"Onerous\" is certainly a negative adjective, but Q2 focuses on verbs and metaphors, and my recollection is that Q1 handles intensified adjectives. If I didn't get a 'yes' to Q1, then I would assume I should follow the chain of command, so to speak.\n\nI then went back to the specific examples and the structure of the rule. The examples list concrete verbs like \"ravaged,\" \"skyrocketed,\" etc. The segment's language is less direct. \"Impose a burden\" describes a potential consequence. While it's negative, it doesn't have the immediate punch of a \"devastating\" verb or metaphor. The examples in the table and the examples in the rules *define* the scope of Q2. If this segment doesn't contain it, then I must move on.\n\nTherefore, *strictly* adhering to the Q2 criteria, the segment does *not* contain a high-potency verb, potent metaphor, superlative + negative noun, or \"on high alert.\" Although the language hints at a negative outcome, it doesn't meet the thresholds for what the decision tree classifies as alarmist framing at this stage.\n\nThus, the answer to Q2 is \"no,\" and I proceed to the next step."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses potential future impact ('could impose a burden', 'eventual scale') and uses plain language ('euthanizations', 'adding') rather than a moderate verb paired with explicit scale/impact from the Q3 list.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for the \"Alarmist\" Frame in Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm diving into this text segment to see if it triggers the \"Alarmist\" frame, specifically as defined by Q3 of the 12-step decision tree. My goal is to determine if the segment uses a \"moderate verb\" from the pre-defined list, paired with explicit scale or impact information, signifying a truly alarmist tone.\n\nLet's break down this segment: *\"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"*\n\nImmediately, I'm looking for those key \"moderate verbs.\"  My initial glance reveals \"depending on,\" \"could impose,\" and \"adding.\"  However, none of these verbs are in the Q3 list of pre-defined terms that I'm specifically looking for. Even if they *were* present, the context is largely hypothetical, focusing on *potential* future impacts (\"depending on,\" \"could\"). The phrase \"subsequent euthanizations\" is a noun phrase derived from a plain outcome verb, but the rule excludes it unless paired with explicit scale/impact.\n\nTherefore, considering all of this, the answer to Q3 is a clear \"no.\" There's no presence of the defining characteristics of an \"Alarmist\" frame based on this specific question, and I can move on to the next evaluation point."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis: Evaluating for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\" I need to determine if it violates Q4, which means I'm looking for loaded rhetorical questions that try to drum up alarm or fear.\n\nFirst, I need to remind myself what Q4 is actually looking for.  It's specifically about questions – rhetorical questions, to be precise – that are crafted to instill fear, urgency, or suggest a worrisome threat.  I have some examples to help, like \"Should consumers worry...?\" versus a more neutral question.\n\nNow, back to my text.  Let me read it again, carefully.  Hmm... I see no question marks.  Does it contain any phrasing that functions as a rhetorical question, even without a question mark? Nope. It's a straight-up declarative statement about the potential economic impact of the H5N1 outbreak. It's forecasting a burden, not questioning anything or urging a response.\n\nTherefore, since there are no questions present, the segment clearly doesn't meet the criteria of Q4. The answer is a definitive \"no\".  The rationale will simply state the obvious: there are no questions in the segment. That's a wrap."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses potential negative economic impacts ('impose a burden on consumers' wallets') and does not contain any explicit language communicating current safety, control, or minimized risk.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of Calming Cues (Q5)**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with analyzing this text snippet in relation to Question Q5 – that's the one that flags any explicit attempts to reassure the audience about safety and control.  I'm looking for language that screams \"don't worry, everything is fine,\"  specifically the kind of phrases and sentiment that the rubric outlines.\n\nMy initial thought is to go through the segment phrase by phrase: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak\" – right off the bat, this is about *future* uncertainty, potentially negative uncertainty.  It's not giving anyone a warm and fuzzy feeling. Then we see \"subsequent euthanizations\" – a hard fact that's absolutely not reassuring. \"Could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets\" – potential negative impact on the consumer, definitely not reassuring. \"Adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry\" – negative background condition.  That's all the segment gives me.\n\nNone of this fits the bill for explicit calming cues.  I'm not seeing anything that signals \"no cause for alarm,\" \"risk is very low,\" or anything else that would directly imply present safety. It's all about *potential* future problems, not immediate comfort. It's focusing on financial impact, not risk mitigation.  So, based on the rubric and my expert judgment, my answer is a resounding \"no.\" I'm ready to proceed to Q6, but for this single-hop prompt, my response is simply the JSON with the \"no\" and rationale."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses potential negative impacts ('impose a burden', 'onerous costs') but does not contain a minimiser ('only', 'just', 'few') combined with a scale contrast ('out of X') to downplay the situation.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Q6 - Minimiser + Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this text snippet based on Q6 of the decision tree. My task is to determine if it uses a 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' pattern specifically for reassurance purposes.\n\nThe relevant section is: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"\n\nRight off the bat, I need to pinpoint the minimiser and scale contrast. I know to look for words like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" or phrases that compare the situation to a larger context or scale, such as \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions.\"\n\nMy initial scan reveals some key phrases. \"However\" indicates a contrast, and the phrase \"depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak\" highlights the importance of the *size* of the problem. Further down, there is a clear mention of a \"burden\" on consumers.\n\nI've gone through the segment and I can't find anything that diminishes the impact via a minimiser. The burden being described is not qualified with an \"only\" or \"just\". It is clear, from the language in this section, that the size of the outbreak is important, but there is no explicit comparison or minimisation. The entire section is *about* the potential negative impacts.\n\nGiven that I haven't found a minimiser *and* a scale contrast being used together to reassure, my answer to Q6 has to be a firm \"no.\" The core reasoning: the pattern doesn't present itself."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a potential negative outcome ('impose a burden', 'adding to costs') and does not contain any bare negation or statement downplaying a risk.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against Question 7**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to assess it based on Q7 of the decision tree. Q7, as I understand it, is specifically looking for \"bare negation\" without any mitigating language. I need to spot phrases like \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" or \"no risk,\" that are used to downplay a potential problem.\n\nThe text is: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"\n\nRight away, I see that the segment *does* acknowledge a potential negative outcome: \"impose a burden\" and \"adding to the already-onerous costs.\" It's directly addressing a potential problem. It's not trying to minimize or dismiss that problem with phrases like \"no evidence\" or \"doesn't pose a risk.\"\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding of Q7 and the text provided, I have to conclude that this segment does *not* contain a \"bare negation.\" It's describing a potential negative impact, which is different.\n\nMy answer to Q7 is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a potential negative impact (burden on wallets) rather than capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment Regarding Question Q8**\n\nOkay, so I need to analyze this text snippet against Question Q8. This is about identifying any statements that indicate capability or preparedness *without* resorting to active reassurance. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the text is actually saying. \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"  Essentially, this is discussing the potential *negative* financial ramifications of a hypothetical H5N1 outbreak and subsequent culling of poultry.\n\nNow, let's critically evaluate this against Q8's criteria. Am I seeing any mention of capabilities, preparedness measures, or even optimistic future possibilities or safeguards?  No, absolutely not. The text highlights a *potential problem*, namely increased costs for consumers, linked to the outbreak's scale and response. There's no talk of resources, plans, training, or anything proactive.\n\nMy conclusion is clear: This segment does not align with the focus of Q8. It's not describing any form of capability or preparedness. It's simply outlining a *potential downside*.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q8 is definitively \"no\".  I'll package that up in a JSON object with a clear explanation:  `{ \"answer\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"The segment describes a potential negative economic consequence, not a capability, preparedness measure, or hopeful future possibility.\"}`  And that's my final answer."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses framing language ('impose a burden', 'onerous costs') rather than standard descriptive verbs and neutral adverbs to report economic impact.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment: A Deep Dive into Q9**\n\nAlright, let's dissect this text segment through the lens of Q9. My goal is to determine if it's primarily a neutral, factual report on prices or metrics, sticking to standard verbs and avoiding any alarmist or reassuring language.\n\nFirst, I identified key phrases: \"impose a burden on consumers' wallets\" and \"onerous costs.\" My immediate concern is with the phrase \"impose a burden.\" This isn't a neutral verb like \"increased\" or \"rose.\" It carries a weight, a metaphorical implication of negative impact. It's not the straightforward, objective reporting I'm looking for in a \"yes\" to Q9.\n\nThen, there's \"onerous costs.\" The adjective \"onerous\" is definitely not neutral. It's a strong word, signaling difficulty, burden, or hardship. This is a risk adjective, precisely the kind of language Q9 is designed to exclude.\n\nNow, let's stack this against the decision tree. The presence of \"impose a burden\" and \"onerous costs\" disqualifies the segment from being a neutral, factual report. It explicitly fails the \"WITHOUT\" condition of Q9, which demands an absence of risk adjectives and explicit framing.\n\nIn looking for further support, I considered the precedence ladder. The fact that this language describes a negative economic impact suggests this would trigger further analysis down the ladder, moving away from a 'Neutral' classification.\n\nIn conclusion, given the presence of framing language and a risk adjective, I must answer \"no\" to Q9. The rationale is straightforward: \"impose a burden\" and \"onerous costs\" don't meet the standards of a factual report using neutral language. This will send the process to Q10."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment speculates about a potential future negative outcome ('could nonetheless impose a burden'), not about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating Text Against Decision Tree Question 10**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with a text segment and need to assess it against Q10 of the decision tree. Q10 is looking for speculation about future relief or improvement *without* a calming cue regarding the current state. This segment reads, \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"\n\nLet's break this down. My focus here is on whether the text speculates about *future relief or improvement*.  The phrase \"could nonetheless impose a burden\" clearly indicates a potential *negative* future outcome. We're talking about a possible financial burden on consumers, not easing of pressure, a positive turn, or anything that could be considered 'relief' or 'improvement'. This is explicitly a downside scenario.\n\nTherefore, the segment *doesn't* fit the criteria for Q10.  It's outlining a potential worsening of the situation, not a lessening.  So, my answer to Q10 is a definitive \"no\".  That said, I'm ready to move on to the next question, which, in this scenario, would be Q11."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no direct quotes or attributed statements from a specific source.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Direct Quotation of Alarmist/Reassuring Frames**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and I need to assess it against Q11. That means I'm looking for direct quotes that clearly express either an alarmist or reassuring frame, originating from a source, rather than the author's own perspective.\n\nFirst, I meticulously went through the text: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"\n\nRight off the bat, I noticed no quotation marks, and no clear attribution to any specific source. This is important. My expertise tells me that unattributed phrases like \"could nonetheless impose a burden\" and \"already-onerous costs\" are the author's own framing of the issue – their analysis or assessment – not a direct quote from a specific person.\n\nBecause there are no direct quotes from a source within the provided text, the answer to Q11 is a clear \"no.\" The segment solely reflects the author's interpretation of the potential economic consequences.\n\nTherefore, the response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment contains no direct quotes or attributed statements from a specific source. The language used reflects the author's own framing of the situation and potential economic impacts.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit and sufficient Alarmist or Reassuring framing cues remain. The potential negative impact ('impose a burden', 'adding to') is described factually without explicit amplification.", "thoughts": "**Q12 Analysis: Neutral Frame Confirmed**\n\nOkay, so the task is to apply the Q12 rule to this text segment: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"  I need to go through my mental checklist.  Even though I'm at Q12, I have to ensure I haven't missed a higher-precedence alarmist or reassuring cue.\n\nFirst, I look for those **INTENSIFIERS + RISK-ADJECTIVES** (Q1).  I see \"onerous costs,\" but that's *already* in place. The new *impact* is \"impose a burden,\" and that combination doesn't quite fit the criteria.  \"Impose a burden\" itself isn't amplified with strong language.\n\nNext, I check for **VIVID-VERBS** (Q2).  Again, \"impose a burden\" isn't a vivid verb like \"devastate\" or \"plunge.\"  \"Adding to\" is also not vivid.\n\nMoving on to **MODERATE-VERB + SCALE/METRIC** (Q3). \"Impose a burden\" is moderate, but there's no specific scale like \"$X million\" or \"significant.\"  It's just \"a burden.\"  The costs are described as \"onerous\" but not amplified in this statement.\n\nNo **EXPLICIT CALMING** language (Q4) is present.  The rest of the rules (Q5-Q11) don't apply, given the text.\n\nSo, I have some negative concepts: \"outbreak,\" \"euthanizations,\" \"burden,\" \"costs.\"  But are they *framed* with explicit alarmist language?  \"Outbreak\" and \"euthanizations\" are descriptive. \"Burden\" is negative, but it's not a \"heavy\" or \"crushing\" burden.  It is a description of the potential impact.\n\nThe phrase \"could nonetheless impose a burden\" uses the modal \"could,\" which default to neutral unless amplified. The potential outcome (\"impose a burden\") isn't amplified in a negative way. The language is descriptive, factual, and doesn't meet the requirements for alarmist framing. The \"burden\" described has to be amplified by intensifiers, vivid verbs, or a scale. It isn't.\n\nTherefore, the language doesn't have the necessary explicit cues for an alarmist frame. The presentation is purely descriptive.\n\nApplying Q12, I confirm that *no* explicit and sufficient Alarmist or Reassuring cues remain.  The analysis confirms a **Neutral** frame. The description of a burden on consumers is descriptive. This fits."}
