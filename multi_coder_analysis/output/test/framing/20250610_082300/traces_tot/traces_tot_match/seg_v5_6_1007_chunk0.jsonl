{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective, nor the 'deadly from the start/outset' idiom.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this text snippet against the first question of the 12-step decision tree for claim framing. The segment is: \"Tyson Foods said in a statement to Newsweek: 'We are actively working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.'\"\n\nMy focus is on Q1, which essentially boils down to looking for those specific linguistic red flags: intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk adjectives (like \"very dangerous\" or \"more deadly\") or that particular idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\"\n\nFirst, I had a quick scan of the segment. I took note of phrases like \"actively working,\" \"state and federal officials,\" and of course, \"the virus\" and \"prevent the spread\". But my focus was solely on that Q1 pattern. I scrutinized the text, looking for any of those keywords. I went through the segment with a fine-toothed comb to see if any intensifiers or comparatives immediately preceded a risk adjective, or if that specific idiom was there.\n\nThe conclusion is clear.  There are no intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives. Also, there's no mention of the specific idiom.  While there is the mention of a virus, that is not a risk adjective, and it is not modified by an intensifier or comparative adjective. \"Prevent the spread\" is an action, not a description of the virus itself or the risk associated with it.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q1 is \"no\". My rationale is straightforward: the text segment does not contain the specified pattern of an intensifier/comparative modifying a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\". This is an easy call. I'm ready to move on."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses standard language ('actively working', 'prevent the spread') and contains no high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases listed in Q2."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the verbs 'working' and 'prevent', which are not on the list of moderate verbs that trigger Q3. It also lacks explicit scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Evaluation - A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Tyson Foods said in a statement to Newsweek: 'We are actively working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.'\" My task is to determine if this triggers an \"Alarmist\" frame according to Question 3 of the decision tree. This means I'm looking for a \"moderate verb\" *coupled with* some form of explicit scale or impact information.\n\nFirst, I identified the key verbs.  \"Working\" and \"prevent\" are the relevant ones.  Then, I meticulously compared these verbs against my mental database (or the provided list and regex, let's be honest!) of moderate verbs.  \"Working\" definitely isn't there, and \"prevent\" isn't on the list either. My initial instinct already tells me where we're headed.\n\nNext, I looked for scale or impact. The phrase \"the spread of the virus\" is present, but this is a broad concept, and it lacks the specific numbers or dramatic language that would make it a trigger. I'm looking for something like \"millions affected,\" \"record losses,\" or \"overwhelming systems\" - the kind of detail that signals real, measurable impact. This is absent.\n\nSince the condition for an \"Alarmist\" frame in Q3 requires *both* a moderate verb *and* scale/impact information, and I've found neither, I can confidently conclude that the answer to Q3 is a clear \"no.\"  I'll need to remember to move on to Q4, but right now, I'm just focusing on that JSON response."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains a statement from Tyson Foods, not a question.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet from Tyson Foods, and I need to determine if it violates the criteria of Question 4 of our decision tree – specifically, whether it contains a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I read the provided text: \"Tyson Foods said in a statement to Newsweek: 'We are actively working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.'\" Clearly, this is a direct quote. My immediate observation? There's no question mark, and the structure is declarative. It's a statement about their actions, not a question of any kind, let alone a rhetorical one.\n\nGiven the nature of Q4, I was on the lookout for a cleverly constructed question, possibly loaded with implied anxieties or concerns. However, the snippet just doesn't go there. It's a straightforward communication. So, based on the absence of *any* question, the answer to Q4 has to be a clear \"no.\" My rationale will simply be that the text segment provided does not contain a question. It's that straightforward."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statement describes actions being taken ('actively working... to prevent') but lacks explicit calming language or a direct link to present public/consumer safety from the corporate source.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment: Not a Calming Cue**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this statement from Tyson Foods: \"'We are actively working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.'\" My task is to see if it meets the criteria for a \"calming cue\" according to Q5 of the claim framing decision tree.\n\nI've got the Q5 rule sheet in front of me, and it's pretty clear about what constitutes an explicit calming cue. I need to see if the statement uses any of the patterns listed, like direct safety assurances (\"no cause for alarm\"), preparedness cues, low-risk evaluations, positive amplification, confidence statements, or bare positive facts. I also checked it against the regex pattern, but it's a no-go there.\n\nNow, this statement *does* talk about action: Tyson is actively working to prevent something. But here's the crucial part: it doesn't explicitly frame this action as a reason for the public to feel safe *right now*. There's no \"rest easy,\" no \"under control,\" no explicit reassurance of present safety.\n\nAnd this is where the Q5 rules get specific. It states that \"corporate self-statements lacking a safety link stay Neutral.\" While preventing the spread is related to safety, this is a corporate statement, not from a government or public health authority. It doesn't explicitly link its preventative action with a statement of current safety for the public. It doesn't use the language that Q5 is looking for.\n\nAccording to the rules, this statement describes capability or action, which doesn't qualify as a calming cue as Q5 defines it. It will likely fall into a different category, potentially Q6, Q7 or even Q12. It's a statement of ongoing effort, but not a direct reassurance of present safety.\nTherefore, my assessment is that this statement doesn't meet the criteria for a calming cue under Q5. My answer is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser word ('only', 'just', etc.) combined with a scale contrast ('out of thousands', etc.) to downplay significance for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment for Q6**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with evaluating this segment: \"Tyson Foods said in a statement to Newsweek: 'We are actively working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.'\" against Q6 of the decision tree. I understand that Q6 is looking for a specific pattern: the use of \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" for reassurance. In other words, I'm hunting for language that downplays the significance of something by using a word like \"only\" or \"just\" *in conjunction with* some contrasting scale.  The goal is to see if they're trying to reassure by diminishing the issue.\n\nLet's break down the segment. First, does it contain a minimizer? Nope. I'm not seeing any \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few\" in sight. These are my go-to keywords for this. Second, does it imply a contrasting scale? Again, no. There's nothing here about a small number compared to a much larger context, like \"a few cases *out of* thousands.\"\n\nFinally, does this language, even if subtly, attempt to downplay or diminish the significance of the issue, with the aim of reassurance? No. The segment simply states that they're *actively working* to prevent the spread. It's a statement of action and capability, not a minimizing statement. I get the sense of active effort, but not an attempt to diminish the virus's impact.\n\nSo, according to my expert analysis, the answer to Q6 is definitively \"no.\" The segment lacks the necessary elements: a minimizer and a clear scale contrast working together for reassurance.  I'm ready to move on, but since the instructions specified Q6 alone, I'll record my findings in a concise JSON format reflecting my reasoning."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes an action ('actively working... to prevent') rather than containing a bare negation about a risk or fact.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text snippet from Tyson Foods' statement to *Newsweek* and I need to determine if it violates Q7. Q7 is all about identifying \"bare negations\" – those instances where a negative statement is made without some kind of explicit calming context. The text is: \"We are actively working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.\"\n\nLet me break this down. Q7 specifically looks for phrases like \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no evidence,\" or \"cannot.\"  The key here is that these phrases, *by themselves*, could suggest a lack of certainty or even potentially downplay a risk. It is this type of negative construct that we are assessing.\n\nBut, this statement isn't doing that. It's not *negating* anything. Instead, it's *affirming* a positive action, a proactive stance.  They're actively *working* to prevent something. That's a key distinction. The language focuses on *effort* and *action*, not denial or the absence of something. It's a statement of work, not a negation.\n\nSo, according to my expert understanding of Q7, this segment does not contain a \"bare negation.\"  My answer has to be a clear \"no.\""}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Describes a response measure ('actively working... to prevent the spread') without explicit reassurance.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Decision Tree Q8**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"Tyson Foods said in a statement to Newsweek: 'We are actively working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.'\" My immediate task is to see if it triggers Q8 of the decision tree. Q8 is all about whether the text describes capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards *without* explicitly linking them to current calm, safety, or minimized risk.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the core action. Clearly, Tyson is \"actively working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.\"  The phrase \"actively working... to prevent the spread\" immediately jumps out at me. This describes an ongoing effort, a measure being taken, or a capability – it's a *response* measure. That feels right, it's definitely in the realm of preparedness.\n\nNext, I need to look for any explicit reassurance. Does the text tell me that this work makes things safe, that the risk is low, or that I can relax? Nope. There's no language of reassurance here, just a statement of action. It's simply stating what they're doing.\n\nI'm checking against Rule C and the examples, and it fits squarely with the \"Neutral\" examples for Capability/Preparedness statements. It describes \"working to prevent\" without any explicit soothing.\n\nSo, let's apply the Q8 logic. The segment clearly describes capabilities and preparedness (\"working... to prevent\"), *without* active reassurance. Therefore, the answer to Q8 has to be \"yes.\" This means the frame is \"Neutral\".\n\nThe decisive cue is the clear description of the action: \"actively working... to prevent the spread\"."}
