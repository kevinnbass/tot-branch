{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the phrase 'highly lethal', which is an intensifier ('highly') directly modifying a risk-adjective ('lethal').", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to analyze the phrase \"They [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\" against Q1 of the claim framing decision tree.  My job is to see if it contains an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nI'm looking specifically for the pattern: `(intensifier|comparative) + risk-adjective`.  Immediately, I see \"highly lethal.\"\n\n\"Highly\" is definitely an intensifier, and \"lethal\" is on the approved list of risk-adjectives. The rules are clear on this.  In fact, \"highly lethal\" is given as a *specific example* that leads to an \"Alarmist\" frame.  The regex pattern itself backs this up with `highly\\s+(deadly|lethal|dangerous|...)`. It's a direct match!\n\nThere's a note about \"highly pathogenic\" being considered neutral, but that's a *technical-term guard* and \"highly lethal\" is distinct from that exception.\n\nTherefore, \"highly lethal\" triggers a \"yes\" on Q1.  The rules are strict: a \"yes\" at Q1 means I stop right here and apply the corresponding frame, which is \"Alarmist.\"  My rationale will need to clearly quote the decisive cue, which is, of course, \"highly lethal.\"  Let's get this framed up as JSON."}
