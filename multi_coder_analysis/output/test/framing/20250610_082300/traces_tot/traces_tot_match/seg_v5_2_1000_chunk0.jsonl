{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes where cases were found but contains no intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to act as their expert claim-framing coder, and they've handed me a text segment to evaluate against their 12-step decision tree, starting with Q1. My task is straightforward: I need to determine if this segment contains an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a \"risk-adjective\", as defined by the Q1 rules.\n\nFirst, I examined the text segment: \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\"\n\nNow, I meticulously scanned the segment, looking specifically for the tell-tale signs: those intensifiers like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"more,\" or the specific idiom \"deadly from the start,\" followed by risk adjectives like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" and so on.\n\nI dissected each part: \"U.S. Department of Agriculture,\" \"APHIS,\" \"said the cases were found,\" \"flock of chickens,\" and the locations. Absolutely nothing. It's simply a factual statement of where cases were discovered. There's no attempt to amp up the risk or severity using those specific linguistic markers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is a definitive \"no.\" The required pattern, the intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective, is completely absent. The segment is purely descriptive, devoid of any framing designed to amplify risk."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the neutral verb 'were found' and contains no high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases as defined by Q2.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Claim Framing Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and need to assess it based on the criteria for Q2 of this 12-step decision tree. Essentially, I'm looking for evidence of emotionally charged language - the kind that really amps up the impact and maybe even borders on hyperbole. The question is, does this segment use any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlatives paired with negative nouns, or that specific \"on high alert\" phrase?\n\nLet's dive in. The segment is: \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\"\n\nRight away, I zero in on the verb \"were found.\" I know the list of high-potency verbs this system is looking for, and \"were found\" isn't on it. It's a straightforward, neutral description. It's simply stating a fact.  No \"ravaged,\" no \"devastated,\" nothing in that intense register. I'm also not seeing any of those vivid metaphors we're watching for.  No \"ticking time-bombs\" or \"raging infernos\" here. And certainly no \"most devastating outbreak\" or anything of that superlative + negative noun ilk. And the \"on high alert\" phrase isn't present either.\n\nSo, based on this evaluation, it's a clear \"no\" for Q2. This segment doesn't contain any of the linguistic markers that the decision tree identifies as indicators of alarmist or heightened framing. It's a factual report, just the facts, ma'am."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'were found' is a plain factual verb, not a moderate verb from the approved list, and the scale ('a flock', 'a backyard flock') is not presented as significant.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Against Q3**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with applying my expertise to this text segment in the context of the decision tree, specifically Question Q3. Let's see... the user is looking for an 'Alarmist' frame based on 'moderate verbs' paired with 'significant scale or impact.'\n\nMy immediate focus goes to the verbs. The main verb describing the events is \"were found,\" as in \"The cases were found...\". I then compared this verb against my mental list of 'moderate verbs' like \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" etc.  It's clear that \"were found\" doesn't fit the profile of a moderate verb. No other verbs in the segment caught my attention as fitting that list either.\n\nNext, I turned my attention to 'significant scale or impact.' The text mentions specific flocks: \"a flock of commercial broiler chickens\" and \"a backyard flock of mixed-species birds.\"  Now, while I acknowledge the specific locations (Kentucky and Virginia) are mentioned, there isn't any hint of a large-scale event.  This is important. While the mention of flocks might indicate some concern, the phrase is notably *not* paired with the *level* of scale of a significant outbreak, like \"millions culled\" or \"record losses.\"\n\nGiven that Q3 requires *both* a moderate verb *and* significant scale/impact, and I found neither, my conclusion is that the condition is not met. The verb isn't moderate, and the scale, while specific, is not presented as overwhelming. Therefore, the answer to Q3 is a definite \"no.\" My rationale would simply be that the text's verb (\"were found\") is not on the 'moderate' list and the scale isn't suggestive of significant impact. Simple as that."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text provides a factual report of where cases were found and contains no questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Decision Tree Q4**\n\nOkay, I'm looking at this text segment and need to determine if it aligns with Q4 of the decision tree, which is about *loaded rhetorical questions implying alarm*. My immediate thought is to scan for questions.  It's pretty straightforward, actually, because there aren't *any* questions. This segment is just a statement of fact: where bird flu cases were detected (I'm inferring bird flu based on the context, but the specific disease isn't named here).  It's just reporting the locations – Fulton County, Kentucky, and Fauquier County, Virginia.\n\nThere's no attempt to persuade through questioning, no implication of urgency or alarm, and definitely no rhetorical devices designed to manipulate the reader's emotions. It's a very dry, factual statement.  So, based on that, the answer to Q4 is clearly \"no.\" I'll construct the JSON response now."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text reports where cases were found but contains no explicit language designed to calm concerns or assure safety.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with evaluating this text snippet against Question Q5. Q5 is looking for those explicit calming cues, the kind that would trigger the \"Reassuring\" frame. I need to see if the segment contains any of those phrases that directly communicate safety, control, or minimize current risk.\n\nFirst, I parsed the text. It's reporting that APHIS found avian influenza in two locations: a commercial flock in Kentucky and a backyard flock in Virginia. Just the facts, as far as I can see.\n\nNow, I'm running through the Q5 checklist in my head. No \"no cause for alarm,\" no \"public can rest easy,\" definitely not \"fully under control.\" I was looking for those intensified low-risk statements (\"very low\") or preparedness cues explicitly tied to public safety. And, of course, any positive amplification like \"excellent news\" or declarations of confidence. Didn't see any of those either.\n\nThe text simply states the facts: where the cases were found. It doesn't use any language to try and soothe concerns or suggest everything is under control. It's just a factual report, no bells or whistles.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is clear: the answer to Q5 is \"no.\" There's no explicit calming language in this segment. My rationale? The text provides factual information about the reported cases but doesn't include any phrases designed to reassure the audience or downplay the risk. It's a simple, straightforward report. Now, time to format that into JSON."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text mentions 'a flock' and 'a backyard flock' but lacks a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) and an explicit scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'nationwide').", "thoughts": "**Q6 Evaluation: No Minimiser + Scale Contrast Detected**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to scrutinize this text snippet through the lens of Q6, specifically looking for that \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern used for reassurance. Here's how I see it:\n\nFirst, I read the text: \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\"\n\nNow, I need to check for the minimizer. I'm trained to look for those lexical cues like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few\". I see \"a flock\" and \"a backyard flock\". While \"a flock\" *could* be misconstrued, the rule is clear: bare numerals or \"one/a\" don't qualify as minimizers unless those listed cues precede them. So, no explicit minimizer here.\n\nNext, I scan for the scale contrast. I know to look for phrases like \"out of thousands,\" \"among millions,\" or \"nationwide\". The text mentions specific locations, \"Fulton County, Kentucky\" and \"Fauquier County, Virginia,\" but doesn't give us any larger context – no \"out of thousands of flocks\" or similar phrasing.\n\nThe rule requires *both* a minimizer *and* a scale contrast.  Since I'm not seeing either element in the required form, I must conclude the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern isn't present.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q6 is \"no.\" My rationale?  The text fails to employ either a clear minimizer or a supporting scale contrast as defined by the Q6 criteria. Simple as that."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports the location of cases but contains no bare negation or explicit calming cue.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment in Relation to Decision Tree Question 7**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\"  My task is to evaluate this against Q7 of a decision tree. Q7's all about identifying \"bare negations\" - that is, statements that downplay a risk or problem *without* providing any explicit calming reassurance.\n\nI've gone through the segment carefully. I'm looking for any negating words or phrases like \"not,\" \"no,\" \"unlikely,\" \"cannot,\" \"don't,\" anything that tries to diminish the seriousness or likelihood of something. And frankly, the segment doesn't contain any of those. It just reports where confirmed cases of avian influenza were found. No attempt at minimizing the situation is present.\n\nTherefore, the condition for a \"yes\" answer to Q7 isn't met. Remember, the rule is: if it's a bare negation (no calming cue), then it's a \"yes.\"  If it's *not* a bare negation (or if there *is* a calming cue with the negation), then it's a \"no.\"\n\nSince there's no bare negation here, the answer to Q7 is definitively \"no.\" This means I need to move on to Q8 in the decision tree (though the prompt only asks for Q7's answer, which is clear). My JSON output will reflect this answer and the core reasoning: the text segment does *not* contain a bare negation."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports case locations but does not describe capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Question Q8**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\"  My task is to determine if this segment meets the criteria of Question Q8. This question asks if the text describes capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards *without* explicitly linking them to current calm, safety, or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is to scan the text for any language related to containment efforts, vaccine development, system implementations, plans, resources, future prospects, or implemented safeguards.  The segment is straightforward: it reports where cases were detected and who reported the finding. It's purely factual.\n\nThere's absolutely no mention of any *action* being taken, any *preparedness measures*, or any *future possibilities*.  It simply states the location of the outbreaks.  The focus is purely on *where* the cases were found, not *what* is being done about it.\n\nConsidering Q8's structure, the question implies that if the segment doesn't contain descriptions of capabilities at all, then it automatically fails the \"without active reassurance\" test. If there aren't any capabilities present in the first place, they can't be presented *without* reassurance.\n\nRereading the question, the examples provided (\"officials are working to contain,\" \"vaccine can be made,\" \"systems are in place\") highlight that Q8 is primarily interested in descriptions of active measures.  The segment provided, however, reports the finding itself, not any *actions* related to the finding.\n\nI must examine whether there's any active language related to managing the situation. \"Said the cases were found in...\" identifies the reporting agency but doesn't detail any actions taken. A phrase like \"APHIS is investigating\" or \"APHIS has implemented quarantine measures\" would have triggered a \"yes\" response if those actions were related to Q8's criteria.\n\nSo, the answer is unequivocally \"no.\" The segment fails to describe the necessary elements (capabilities, preparedness, etc.) that Q8 is concerned with. The segment merely reports a finding; no actions or capabilities are described. Therefore, it does not meet Q8's conditions.\n\nMy analysis aligns perfectly with the examples provided for Q8. \"Yes\" examples detail capabilities, while \"No\" examples include reassurance. The segment doesn't describe any capabilities, so \"no\" is the logical answer.\n\nI'll confirm my analysis using the provided regex pattern, confirming that none of the target words appear in the text. This corroborates my determination.\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment reports case locations but does not describe capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports locations and types of animals where cases were found, not prices, economic data, or numerical metrics.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of This Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to apply Q9 of this decision tree to a specific text segment. The goal here is to determine if the segment primarily focuses on reporting prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics. \n\nLet's break it down: Q9 essentially wants to know if the segment is, in essence, a data dump related to financial figures. Based on the provided rules, this would involve standard reporting using neutral language, not the colorful prose or risk-laden descriptors that would suggest another classification.\n\nThe text segment in question reads: \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\"\n\nNow, this clearly describes the *location* and *type of animal* where certain cases were found. It's almost certainly related to some sort of animal health issue, most likely bird flu given the context. However, it's not actually *giving me* any financial figures, cost data, revenue information, or any other numeric metrics that would trigger Q9. The question I have to ask myself is: \"Is this primarily reporting prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics...?\" And the answer is a very clear \"no.\"\n\nMy understanding is that I just need to provide the JSON response for Q9, which I will:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment reports locations and types of animals, not prices, economic data, or numerical metrics.\"\n}\n```"}

Q10 focuses on whether the segment speculates about future relief or improvement without explicit calming cues about the current state. If it does, the frame is Neutral. If not, I move on.\n\nReading the segment, it's clear it's reporting factual information: the location of confirmed cases identified by the USDA. There's no language suggesting future improvement, easing, or prediction. It simply presents the locations where cases were found.\n\nSince there's no speculation about future relief or improvement, my answer to Q10 is \"no.\"  The provided segment does not contain any of the indicators of future relief speculation, such as \"may be short-lived,\" \"could ease soon,\" \"might improve,\" or \"predict recovery.\" My rationale is that it's a factual report and does not meet Q10's criteria. It's a neutral piece of information reporting *where* cases were found, not *what* may happen. I must proceed to the next question in the decision tree."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment attributes information to APHIS but contains no direct quote or attributed statement with explicit framing language.", "thoughts": "**Q11 Evaluation: No Clear Alarmist/Reassuring Frame**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text snippet: \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said...\". The task is to see if it triggers Q11 of my claim framing decision tree.  Specifically, I'm checking if there's a clear Alarmist or Reassuring frame from a direct quote. First, I identify the attributed source: APHIS. Next, I notice there are no actual *quotes* used.  Finally, I consider the content of APHIS's statement itself. It's purely factual - where and what type of cases were found. No explicit framing language. Since there's no quote and no explicit framing, the answer to Q11 has to be \"no\". I should move on to Q12, as instructed."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports the finding of cases factually, specifying source, location, and affected populations without explicit alarmist or reassuring language.", "thoughts": "**Final Assessment: Neutral Frame**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the very end of this decision tree, Q12. The task is to give a final check for any lingering Alarmist or Reassuring cues that might have slipped through the previous eleven questions. I've already scrutinized the segment, and I'm looking specifically for anything that screams \"alarm\" or tries to soothe the reader, even subtly.\n\nNow, the segment says: \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\"\n\nHmm, let's break this down. It reports that \"cases were found\" – factual reporting, plain and simple. It's giving us the source, APHIS, the specific \"cases,\" and the locations and affected populations. No intensifiers, no dramatic verbs, no overblown language, and definitely no attempt to calm us down. It's just stating the facts.\n\nThe language is entirely descriptive, reporting the finding and the relevant context. This fits perfectly with the definition of a Neutral frame, specifically *Factual Reporting*, as outlined in the Q12 pattern table. So, I'm confident in saying that this segment defaults to Neutral. Q12 gets a resounding \"yes.\""}
