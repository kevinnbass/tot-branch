{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'highly' modifying the risk-adjective 'lethal'.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text for Alarmist Language**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment: \"They [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\" My task is to apply Q1 of the 12-step decision tree. Essentially, I need to see if there's an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nI immediately identify the phrase \"highly lethal bird flu.\" \"Highly\" is clearly an intensifier, and \"lethal\" is a risk-adjectiveâ€”that's explicitly defined in the Q1 rules. Furthermore, \"highly\" *directly* modifies \"lethal\", fitting the \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj\" pattern.  I know this pattern triggers the \"Alarmist\" frame. There's no getting around it, \"highly lethal\" is a direct match to the examples provided in the rules. Since I've found a match for Q1, that's my answer. No need to go deeper."}
