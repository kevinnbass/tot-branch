{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a factual procedure ('quarantined') and mentions 'HPAI', which is excluded by the technical-term guard for Q1.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: A Thorough Examination**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA,\" with the task of answering Q1 of our 12-step decision tree. Essentially, I need to check if there's an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nMy initial thought is to scan for the tell-tale signs: words like \"so,\" \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"more,\" or \"deadlier\" in close proximity to adjectives describing risk, like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" or \"contagious.\" I also have to keep an eye out for that specific phrase, \"deadly from the start.\"  A quick glance tells me this isn't immediately obvious, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see \"HPAI\" which, given my knowledge, I immediately recognize as \"Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza.\"  The rule specifically tells me that \"highly pathogenic\" *as part of the formal name* is neutral, unless it's paired with other alarmist indicators. So, a red flag isn't immediately raised.\n\nNext, I see the word \"quarantined.\" This is a factual, procedural description, a response to a situation. It's not a risk-adjective, and therefore, no intensifier would modify it.\n\nI confirm my quick assessment: there are no intensifiers modifying any adjectives related to risk. I don't see anything like \"very deadly,\" \"more dangerous,\" or \"extremely contagious.\" And I don't see the specific idiom, \"deadly from the start.\"\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is clear: Q1 is a \"no.\" There is no intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective in this text segment. I will need to provide this as my rationale and then move on to Q2. But right now, my focus is the JSON for Q1."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the factual term 'quarantined' which is not a high-potency verb, potent metaphor, superlative-negative noun, or critical alert phrase.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Alarmist Cues (Q2)**\n\nOkay, so I need to assess this text snippet: \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA\" against Question Q2 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if it uses any language that would frame the situation alarmingly. Specifically, I'm looking for the presence of high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative noun combinations, or the phrase \"on high alert.\"\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n*   **High-Potency Verbs:** No, the text doesn't use verbs like \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" or \"skyrocketed,\" which would immediately signal urgency or devastation.\n*   **Superlative + Negative Noun:**  I see no phrases like \"worst crisis\" or \"most expensive disaster.\"  This combination, when used, can amplify the severity.\n*   **Critical Alert Phrase:** The phrase \"on high alert\" is also absent.\n*   **Potent Metaphors:**  There are no metaphors like \"ticking time-bomb\" or \"nightmare scenario\" that would create a sense of impending doom.\n\nThe verb \"quarantined\" is the key here. It's a technical term, a standard operating procedure in this context. It's factual and doesn't carry the emotional weight or hyperbole of a high-potency verb.\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis of the text against the Q2 criteria, my answer is \"no\". The segment does not contain any of the linguistic cues outlined in the pattern recognition table or the regex pattern that would indicate an alarmist framing. The language is factual and neutral."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses factual verbs ('is found', 'are quarantined') and provides no information about scale or impact, failing the Q3 criteria.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for an Alarmist Frame**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the sentence: \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\" My task is to assess this against Question 3 of the 12-step decision tree, which is looking for alarmist framing. This means I'm searching for \"moderate verbs\" paired with information about significant scale or impact.\n\nEssentially, I need to see if the sentence uses verbs that *imply* a dramatic or damaging effect *alongside* details that highlight that damage's extent. We're looking for things like \"hit\", \"swept\", or \"plummeted\" used in conjunction with \"millions\" or \"record losses.\"\n\nLooking at the sentence, the verbs are \"is found\" and \"are quarantined.\"  \"Is found\" is purely factual, and \"are quarantined\" describes a standard containment procedure. Neither falls into the category of \"moderate verbs\" that suggest alarm. Furthermore, there's absolutely no mention of scale or impact – no numbers of affected farms, no estimated losses, nothing to indicate this is a situation of significant proportions in the text provided.\n\nSince the necessary verb and scale/impact markers aren't present, the answer to Question 3 is definitively \"no\".  My evaluation indicates a lack of the specific elements required to constitute an alarmist frame, therefore the criteria for Q3 are not satisfied."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement describing a procedure, not a loaded rhetorical question.", "thoughts": "**Q4 Evaluation: No Loaded Rhetorical Questions Found**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\" My task is to assess it against Q4 of the decision tree, which is about loaded rhetorical questions implying alarm.  I'm looking closely now.  This is a straightforward declarative statement about USDA procedures. There aren't any question marks, nor is there any phrasing that suggests a question, loaded or otherwise. I'm very familiar with spotting these rhetorical devices, and I see nothing here that fits the profile.  So, based on the text provided, my answer to Q4 is unequivocally \"no.\" The segment is a statement, a factual declaration, not a question designed to alarm.  I'm ready to record my answer and move on to Q5, but my focus is just Q4 for now."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a factual procedure (quarantine) but lacks explicit calming language or intensified low-risk evaluation.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm evaluating this text snippet, \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA,\" against Q5. The goal is to see if it provides explicit calming cues, assuring present safety, control, or significantly minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought? This seems straightforward. The text is a factual statement about a USDA procedure – quarantine. It's a control measure, sure, but it's not *framed* in a way that directly reassures the public. I'm looking for those explicit \"don't worry\" signals from the Q5 list, and I'm not seeing them.\n\nIt's not using the reassuring language I'm specifically looking for. Phrases like \"no cause for alarm\" or \"risk is very low\" are absent.  It doesn't amplify the positive or express confidence in the public's current safety. The quarantine itself is a standard operational response to a negative event, and it's not being presented as a *reason* for anyone to feel reassured.\n\nSo, according to my expertise and the Q5 criteria, it's a \"no.\" I'll construct the appropriate JSON response for the prompt."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment 'Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA' contains neither a minimiser nor a scale contrast element required for Q6.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment for Reassurance Pattern Q6**\n\nOkay, I've been tasked with assessing that text snippet against the criteria for Reassurance pattern Q6, specifically looking for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" combination. Let's break it down:\n\nThe segment, \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA,\" is straightforward enough. We're talking about a quarantine procedure following a High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) detection.\n\nMy first check is for a minimiser – words like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"a few.\" There are none of those present.  My second check involves a scale contrast – something like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions,\" aiming to put the event into a larger context to minimize its perceived significance.  Again, nothing of the sort is used here.\n\nSince neither the minimiser nor the scale contrast element is present, the answer to Q6 is definitively \"no.\" It's a simple quarantine statement, without any attempt to downplay or contextualize the event within a larger scale. Based on the instructions, I'll proceed with the JSON response now."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes an action ('are automatically quarantined') and does not contain a bare negation.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the statement: \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\" My task is to analyze this within the framework of Question Q7, which is looking for a \"bare negation\" without an explicit calming cue. I need to determine if this sentence presents a direct, unsupported negation.\n\nFirst, I scrutinize the text itself. Does it contain any words that immediately signal negation – words like \"not,\" \"no,\" \"unlikely,\" or any similar terms?  No, I don't see any of those typical negation indicators. It's simply describing a process.\n\nThen I apply my understanding of Q7's core principle. The question seeks to identify instances where a risk or problem is negated without offering any mitigating context. This segment doesn't negate anything, per se. It *affirms* an action taken in the event of a specific condition: the detection of HPAI. It describes a consequence, not a negation of a risk.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is straightforward. The segment doesn't fit the 'bare negation' pattern Q7 is designed to detect. The answer to Q7 is definitively \"no\". I'll format my response accordingly as a JSON object, ready for processing."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Describes a safeguard ('automatically quarantined') without explicitly linking it to current calm or safety."}
