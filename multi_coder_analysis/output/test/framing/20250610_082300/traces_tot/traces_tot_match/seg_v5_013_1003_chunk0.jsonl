{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Q1**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to determine if it triggers Q1 of the decision tree. Q1, as I know it, is all about spotting those telltale intensifiers or comparatives directly modifying risk-adjectives. I've got a good eye for this kind of language, so let's break it down.\n\nThe segment reads: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\" Right off the bat, I see \"spreading,\" which is a verb, not a risk-adjective. So, no intensifiers there. Moving on, \"after dozens tested positive\" is just a factual statement - no risk-adjectives or intensifiers to be seen. Finally, \"along the U.S. East Coast\" is simply specifying location.\n\nBased on my analysis, this segment simply doesn't contain the type of language Q1 is looking for. There's no \"so deadly,\" no \"very dangerous,\" no \"more severe,\" or anything like that.  Therefore, my answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" My rationale? Simply put, no intensifier or comparative adjective is modifying a risk-adjective in this segment. It's a straightforward case."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses moderate language ('spreading', 'tested positive') and does not contain high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases listed in Q2.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: A Brief Examination**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to assess this segment, \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast,\" against Q2 of the decision tree. My focus is on those alarmist indicators: high-potency verbs, impactful metaphors, superlative-negative noun combinations, and the \"on high alert\" phrase.\n\nLet's dissect this. \"Spreading\" is the key verb here, and while it describes transmission, it's not one of those heavy hitters like \"devastated\" or \"ravaged\" that immediately screams crisis. \"Tested positive\" is straightforward data reporting. \"Dozens\" sets a scale but without any sensational framing. The virus itself is mentioned, obviously the threat, but it's not paired with a trigger phrase like 'on high alert.'\n\nHonestly, there's no match for any of the Q2 cues in this text. No potent metaphors, no superlative disasters, nothing to raise the alarm in that specific way. So, my conclusion is clear: the answer to Q2 is \"no.\" I'll then move on to Q3."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a moderate verb from the specified list paired with significant scale or impact information. 'dozens' is not considered significant scale in this context.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Evaluation: A Detailed Breakdown**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast,\" and I need to assess it against Question 3 of the decision tree. Q3 wants me to determine if the text includes a \"moderate verb\" *paired with* information implying \"significant scale or impact.\" Let's break this down meticulously, as I always do.\n\nFirst, I identified the segment and zeroed in on the verbs. I'm looking for those \"moderate verbs\" that trigger the red flags, specifically those listed in the regex or by the provided list: `hit`, `swept`, `surged`, `soared`, `plunged`, `plummeted`, `prompted`, `feared`, `fearing`, `were/was culled`. Now, in the text, I see \"spreading\" and \"tested positive.\" Hmmm, \"spreading\" isn't on the list, and neither is \"tested positive.\" It's tempting to categorize the action as such, but according to the given conditions, the answer is no.\n\nNext, I have to consider \"significant scale/impact\". \"Dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast\". \"Dozens\" indicates a number. \"Along the U.S. East Coast\" points to geographic scope. But does \"dozens\" imply a *significant* impact in a context of, let's say, widespread outbreaks? Compared to the examples the previous output provided (\"millions culled,\" \"record losses,\" \"overwhelming systems,\" \"thousands affected\"), \"dozens\" feels relatively small-scale. It's simply not significant enough.\n\nSo, do I have a moderate verb *paired* with significant impact? Nope. The verbs are not on my list, and \"dozens\" doesn't quite meet the threshold for significant scale. Therefore, my answer to Q3 is a clear \"no.\" I'm now ready to provide the necessary JSON response."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain a question, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\" My task is to assess it against question Q4 of the decision tree, which specifically looks for loaded rhetorical questions designed to induce a sense of alarm.\n\nFirst, I need to identify if this segment even *is* a question. I read it over carefully. Nope. It's a declarative statement. It *tells* me something. There's no question mark, no implied question, nothing. Q4 is all about finding questions, specifically loaded ones that try to manipulate the reader.\n\nSince this segment is not a question, by definition, it can't be a loaded rhetorical question. So, my answer to Q4 has to be \"no.\" The rationale is straightforward: the segment simply doesn't contain a question. It's a statement of fact, regardless of the implications it may or may not hold."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (birds spreading virus after testing positive) and contains no explicit language or cues designed to calm the audience or communicate current safety/control.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\"  My task is to see if this passes the Q5 test, which is all about spotting any *explicit* attempts to reassure someone, like a direct promise of safety, some official preparedness talk, an \"it's super low risk!\" kind of statement, anything positive that downplays danger, or a confident \"we've got this\" vibe.\n\nScanning the text, I'm just not seeing it.  It's talking about a potential *negative* situation – birds carrying a virus. There's no \"don't worry,\" no \"we're on top of it,\" no reassurance at all. No attempt to soften the blow or paint things as secure.  So, based on Q5, the answer is a firm \"no.\"  I'll move on to the next question now, but for this step, it's just that simple \"no\" answer in the Q5 JSON."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'dozens' but this is not a listed minimiser ('only', 'just', 'merely', 'a single', 'few'), nor is there an explicit scale contrast ('out of X') to downplay the number.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Minimizer + Scale Contrast (Q6)**\n\nOkay, here's my assessment. The user wants me to look at this sentence and see if it fits the \"Minimizer + Scale Contrast\" pattern, specifically for Reassurance, as defined by Q6.\n\nLet's break it down. I'm focusing on \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, *after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.*\" My initial read is that I need to look for a minimizer – something like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"few\" – and a scale contrast, which would highlight a larger context to make the \"dozens\" seem relatively small.\n\nI immediately see \"dozens.\" But, according to the rule, \"dozens\" isn't a *minimizer* in itself. The rule specifically lists \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few.\" It feels a bit like a bare numeral, but it's not preceded by one of those listed words, so it's not a minimizer.\n\nNext, I look for a scale contrast. The phrase \"along the U.S. East Coast\" indicates a location, but it doesn't really set up a larger scale against which \"dozens\" can be compared and minimized. I'm looking for something like \"dozens out of thousands\" or \"dozens among millions\" to make it seem insignificant. I don't see that.\n\nTherefore, because \"dozens\" isn't a minimizer as defined by the rule, and because there's no clear scale contrast, I have to conclude that the pattern isn't present in this segment. I'm sure it's the right \"no.\" Now, on to Q7, even though I don't have to answer it."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any bare negation or statement denying/downplaying a risk or problem.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for \"Bare Negation\" in the Provided Text**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text snippet: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\" My task is to evaluate this against Question 7 of our decision tree, specifically checking for a \"bare negation\" without an accompanying calming cue. I need to be on the lookout for phrases that directly negate or minimize the risk, something like \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no evidence,\" or outright denials.\n\nWhen I dissect the text, I see that it highlights a potential problem: the spread of a virus by wild birds. It even offers supporting data – the \"dozens tested positive\" piece.  Crucially, though, I don't see any of those telltale negation phrases. There's no attempt to soften the blow by saying, for instance, \"Tests were negative\" or implying that the spread is \"unlikely.\"\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding of \"bare negation\" and the provided criteria, I'm confidently answering \"no\" to Question 7. There's simply no direct negation or downplaying of the risk within the segment. Now, with a \"no\" answer, it's onward to the next step, Q8, in the decision tree."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the source and impact of virus spread, not capabilities, preparedness, safeguards, or hopeful future possibilities.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment against Question Q8**\n\nOkay, here's my assessment. The user's asked me to evaluate this segment, \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast,\" against Question Q8 of a decision tree. Q8 is looking for descriptions of capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, *without* those things being explicitly tied to current calm, safety, or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is to break down the segment. \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus\" describes a potential spread mechanism – a negative fact. Then, \"after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast\" details the consequences of that spread, more negative facts.\n\nDoes this fit Q8? No, it doesn't. Q8 wants to hear about what we *can* do, what we're *planning*, the *hopes* we have, or the *measures* we've put in place. This segment is talking about the virus's spread and impact. It's about a negative situation, not a positive or neutral stance on capabilities or safeguards.\n\nI have to be careful here because the prompt is very specific. It doesn't ask me to look ahead to later questions. I need only focus on Q8. My answer has to be a simple \"no\" because the segment simply doesn't meet the criteria. It doesn't mention any efforts to contain, prevent, or address the situation in a hopeful or protective manner.\n\nI've also reviewed the examples within the Q8 Pattern Recognition Table and Detailed Rules. The provided segment doesn't match descriptions of efforts, like officials working to contain, vaccines being made, or systems in place.\n\nTherefore, my final answer to Q8 is indeed \"no.\" The segment fails to describe capabilities, preparedness, safeguards, or hopeful future possibilities."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports on virus spread and test results, not prices, economic data, or financial metrics as defined by Q9.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Decision Tree Q9**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\" My task is to see if this aligns with Q9 of the decision tree. Q9, as I understand it, is looking for text primarily reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using neutral language. I need to spot standard descriptive verbs and potentially neutral adverbs *without* any vivid or potentially framing words.\n\nMy initial impression is that this is about a virus spreading amongst wild birds, and the \"dozens\" that tested positive. While there's a numerical element (\"dozens\"), it's *not* reporting economic or financial metrics. Q9 is specifically focused on things like market prices, costs, rates, profits - that sort of thing. The examples and the regex provided in Q9 strongly suggest this. This isn't market data. It's about a biological phenomenon.\n\nSo, while \"dozens\" is a number, it's not being used in the context Q9 is looking for. It doesn't use the verbs or structures associated with reporting economic data.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q9 has to be \"no\". It's not reporting the type of data Q9 is designed to evaluate, which is primarily economic/financial data."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a current suspected mechanism of spread and past test results; it does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus...\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\" And I need to see if it meets the criteria of Q10: does it speculate about future relief or improvement *without* a calming cue about the present?\n\nLet's break this down. \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus\" - that's about the current situation, a mechanism of spread being *thought* to be active right now. Then, \"after dozens tested positive...\" - this is about past events solidifying the idea. Neither part suggests any kind of *future* change.\n\nI'm looking for language of hope, prediction, timeline... anything indicating potential improvement down the line.  But it's just not there.  No \"may,\" \"might,\" \"could,\" no \"expect,\" or \"hope.\" No \"soon\" or \"next year.\"  The focus is on the present and the past, the current issue and supporting evidence.\n\nTherefore, Q10 is a definite \"no.\"  This segment just doesn't venture into speculation about a brighter future. I understand now to move on to the next question in my decision tree. The system will handle that."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any direct quotations or attributed statements from a specific source.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a piece of text and tasked with checking it against Q11, which concerns itself with dominant frames established through direct quotations. Let's see... the text is \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\"\n\nMy first step is to scan for any direct quotes, which are usually marked by quotation marks. I don't see any.  That's key.  Q11 specifically asks about *directly quoted* sources *framing* the narrative.  Since there aren't any, the answer is immediately obvious.\n\nGiven the nature of the query, the answer is definitively \"no.\"  The supporting rationale is straightforward: the text segment in question does not include any direct quotations from any source.  My job here is a simple verification of the lack of something specific - a directly quoted source - and therefore the answer is clearly \"no\"."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports negative facts (virus spread, positive tests) using factual, neutral language ('thought to be spreading', 'dozens tested positive') without explicit framing cues.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: This Segment is Neutral**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to assess whether this text chunk aligns with Q12 of the 12-step decision tree, which essentially boils down to whether it's *Neutral* by default. The key is to see if there are *no* explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues, and if the facts are presented... well, factually.\n\nMy thought process here follows the established guidelines: Bedrock, Symmetry, Context Guard, and Precedence Ladder. I'm focusing on the *absence* of higher-order framing.\n\nFirst, I go through the Alarmist cues (Q1-Q3). There are no intensifiers modifying risk adjectives, no vivid verbs describing the *impact* of the threat (spreading is just a standard transmission verb here), and no exaggeration or loaded metaphors.\n\nThen I check for Reassuring cues (Q4). Nope, nothing there either. No calming language.\n\nFinally, I land on the Neutral cues. The segment, \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast,\" presents negative information – virus spread, positive tests – but it does so in a fundamentally factual way.\n\nThe phrase \"are thought to be spreading\" uses a modal verb indicating belief or possibility, which isn't inherently alarmist; it doesn't amplify the threat.  \"Dozens tested positive\" is a straightforward, albeit imprecise, reporting of a fact.\n\nThe language aligns perfectly with the \"Factual Reporting\" and \"Standard Procedures\" examples in the Q12 table. It's a \"Severe Fact, Neutral Presentation,\" as I've seen explained in the detailed rules.\n\nTherefore, because there are no explicit alarmist or reassuring framing cues, and the information is presented factually, I'm confident in answering \"yes\" to Q12, declaring this segment *Neutral*. The rationale will emphasize the absence of alarmist/reassuring language, and the factual nature of the information."}
