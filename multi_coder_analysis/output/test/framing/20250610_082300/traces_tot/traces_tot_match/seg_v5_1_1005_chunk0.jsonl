{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective from the specified list.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Evaluation: No Intensified Risk-Adjective Found**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to analyze this segment – \"...Farms... outbreak in 2015...\" – against Q1 of the decision tree. Q1 is all about spotting *intensifiers* or *comparatives* that directly modify *risk-adjectives*.  In other words, are we seeing phrases like \"very dangerous\" or \"deadlier than\"?\n\nI ran through the segment and looked for those key elements.  My first thought was \"high alert,\" but \"high\" describes a state, not the inherent risk. It's more about preparedness. \"Widespread bird flu outbreak\" doesn't work either. \"Widespread\" describes the *scale* of the event, not the inherent danger of the flu itself in an amplified way.  The phrase about the birds killed and the money spent... those are *results*, not intensified risk descriptors.\n\nSo, I don't see any examples of an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective. There's no \"very deadly,\" no \"more dangerous,\" none of the patterns I'm looking for. This is a clear \"no\" for Q1. The segment discusses the consequences of an event and the precautions being taken, but it doesn't meet the specific criteria of amplified risk language as defined in the question."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The phrase \"on high alert\" combined with the mention of \"bird flu outbreak\" triggers the Alarmist frame under Q2.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and tasked with evaluating it against Question Q2 of the 12-step decision tree.  My expertise immediately kicks in; I know this is about identifying potentially alarmist language.  I need to check for high-potency verbs, impactful metaphors, superlative plus negative nouns, or, specifically, the phrase \"on high alert\" *when* a threat is also present.\n\nThe segment says, \"Farms that raise turkeys and chickens... are on high alert and taking steps to increase biosecurity, fearing a repeat of a widespread bird flu outbreak...\"  The first thing that jumps out at me, and I'm practically *looking* for it, is \"on high alert.\"  I know that's a key indicator.  Now I have to confirm the co-occurrence of a threat.  And bingo, right there in the same sentence is \"bird flu outbreak.\"  That's exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nI double-check my mental notes: the Q2 rule explicitly calls out \"Critical Alert Phrase ('on high alert' - same sentence must name a threat: outbreak, virus, flu, risk, danger …)\" as an Alarmist trigger.  And I know the regex pattern I use includes a proximity check; it confirms that \"on high alert\" and \"bird flu outbreak\" are within the acceptable range.  That's all the evidence I need.\n\nTherefore, my answer is \"yes.\" The decisive cue is absolutely the phrase \"on high alert\" *in conjunction with* the mention of the \"bird flu outbreak.\"  That's a textbook example of an Alarmist trigger under Q2."}
