{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'highly' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Alarmist Claim Framing - Q1**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to check it against the first question of the 12-step decision tree for claim framing. Essentially, I'm hunting for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective, right?  The segment is: \"Health officials announced Monday that they detected a highly contagious strain of bird flu in two additional U.S. states, furthering a threat to the country's poultry industry.\"\n\nLet's break this down.  The rule is looking for a pattern: `Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective`.  I've got my list of intensifiers (like \"highly,\" \"very,\" etc.) and risk-adjectives (\"contagious,\" \"deadly,\" and so on) handy.\n\nI quickly spotted the phrase: \"highly contagious\". Now, \"highly\" *is* an intensifier, and \"contagious\" *is* a risk-adjective.  And yes, \"highly\" directly modifies \"contagious.\" Bingo!  This matches the Q1 pattern perfectly.\n\nI'm aware of the technical-term guard for \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI),\" but that isn't applicable here, as it uses the term \"highly contagious strain.\" It's not the same.\n\nTherefore, since the phrase \"highly contagious\" fits the criteria, my answer to Q1 is a clear \"yes.\"  According to the Precedence Ladder, Q1 holds the highest priority, and a \"yes\" here automatically signifies an Alarmist frame.\n\nI'll need to provide this in JSON format with the answer and rationale, quoting the \"highly contagious\" cue, as in the user's instructions."}
