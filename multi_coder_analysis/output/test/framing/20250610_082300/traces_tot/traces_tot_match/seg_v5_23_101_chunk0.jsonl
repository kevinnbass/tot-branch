{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective. 'Soared' and 'ravaged' are verbs describing impact/consequence, not intensified risk adjectives.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Q1**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and I need to assess it based on Q1 of the decision tree. Let's see... the segment is: \"Egg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015.\" My task is to look for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nFirst, I quickly scan the sentence. \"Egg prices soared\"... that's about the economic consequence. Then \"outbreak ravaged the United States\"... ah, that's where the *threat* part comes in. But let's check the core question. Q1 asks for `Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective`.\n\nI'm looking for words like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or comparatives like \"more\" or \"deadlier\" *directly* before an adjective describing the *inherent* risk of the outbreak. I see no such pattern here. \"Soared\" and \"ravaged\" are strong verbs, but they describe consequences and *impact*. They don't speak to the intensity *of the risk* itself. So, no intensifiers or comparatives modifying a risk-adjective. The \"ravaged\" part seems more like Q2 territory, given that vivid verb describing the realized impact.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" I'll move on to Q2."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment uses the high-potency verbs 'soared' (modifying prices, a direct impact noun) and 'ravaged' to describe the event and its impacts, framing the situation alarmingly.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Alarmist Framing Detected**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment: \"Egg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015,\" and I need to assess it against the decision tree, specifically Q2. That means I'm hunting for alarmist framing cues: potent verbs, metaphors, superlative/negative noun combinations, or critical alert phrases.\n\nFirst, I scanned for those patterns. The verbs \"soared\" and \"ravaged\" immediately jumped out. \"Soared\" is flagged in the table as a high-potency verb, but it needs to be followed by an impact noun within a certain proximity. And bingo! It *is* followed by \"Egg prices,\" which definitely qualifies. \"Ravaged\" is also a high-potency verb, and it paints a vivid, destructive picture.\n\nSince both \"soared\" and \"ravaged\" are present, I have to conclude that Q2 is a \"yes\".  The presence of these two high-potency verbs triggers the alarmist frame. The process dictates that I stop here and declare the frame.\n\nTherefore, the frame is **Alarmist**, and my rationale is based on the decisive cues: \"soared\" and \"ravaged.\""}
