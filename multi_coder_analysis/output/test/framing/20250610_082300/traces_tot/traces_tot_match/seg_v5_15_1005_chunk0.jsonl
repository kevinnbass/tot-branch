{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The comparative adjective 'more' modifies the risk-adjective 'deadly'.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Alarmist Frame Detected**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment and need to assess it based on the first question of the 12-step decision tree for claim framing. Specifically, I'm looking for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nThe segment is: \"Sometimes those strains [of avian influenza] can get into domestic flocks and mutate into more deadly viruses.\"\n\nNow, according to my knowledge, the rule for Q1 is pretty straightforward: search for the structure `Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective`. Examples I keep in mind are phrases like \"so deadly\" or \"more dangerous.\" My list of risk-adjectives include words like deadly, dangerous, and a few others.\n\nIn this segment, I immediately spot the phrase \"more deadly.\" \"More\" functions as a comparative adjective, and \"deadly\" is undeniably a risk-adjective. Bingo! It's a perfect match: `Comparative + Risk-Adjective`.\n\nThis means the answer to Q1 is definitively \"yes.\" The crucial cue that solidified this decision is \"more deadly.\"\n\nBased on the precedence ladder, a \"yes\" to Q1 signifies the \"Alarmist\" frame. So, my output needs to reflect this, providing the confirmed answer and the rationale for that conclusion."}
