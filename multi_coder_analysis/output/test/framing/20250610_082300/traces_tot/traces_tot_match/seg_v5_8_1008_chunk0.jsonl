{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no intensifiers, comparatives, or risk-adjectives.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I'm being asked to apply Q1 of this 12-step claim framing decision tree to the segment: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\" Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Q1 is looking for: intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly modifying a risk-adjective.  This means I'm immediately looking for words like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"more,\" or comparative forms like \"deadlier\" in close proximity to words describing risk, things like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" or \"severe.\"\n\nI'll read through the segment again: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\"  Okay, no, there aren't any intensifiers or comparatives. I'm not seeing any \"so,\" \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or anything like that.  Similarly, I'm not seeing any of the risk adjectives. Nothing like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" or any terms describing severity or potential harm.\n\nSince I don't see either, I can conclude the pattern isn't present.  No intensifier/comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\"  The provided segment does not contain the specified pattern of intensifier/comparative + risk-adjective.  The segment is simply a statement about information disclosure."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a lack of disclosure, but does not use any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases to frame the situation alarmingly.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze the text, \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky,\" through the lens of Q2 in the 12-step decision tree for claim framing. My expertise kicks in here - I know this decision tree inside and out. Q2 is all about identifying those \"alarm bells,\" the language that amps up a situation.\n\nEssentially, I need to check if the text employs any of the telltale signs: powerful verbs, striking metaphors, superlative-negative pairings, or those critical alert phrases that signal a potential exaggeration or alarmist framing. I have the specific patterns in my mind: the \"ravageds,\" the \"nightmare scenarios,\" the \"worst crisis\" phrasing, and of course, \"on high alert\" (with the caveat about a nearby threat).\n\nLet's break down the segment. \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\" Right away, the verbs don't jump out. \"Would not disclose\" is a perfectly reasonable, factual statement. No \"skyrocketing,\" no \"slaughtering,\" nothing that suggests an alarming scenario.\n\nNext, I scan for metaphors. Nothing metaphorical here. It’s straight talk. No ticking time bombs or anything of that nature. Similarly, no \"worst crisis\" or other superlative-negative combinations. It's just a statement of non-disclosure.\n\nFinally, I'm checking for \"on high alert.\" Nope. Not even close.\n\nIn my expert opinion, this text segment simply states a fact: Tyson Foods didn't share information. It's devoid of those rhetorical devices and linguistic cues that Q2 is looking for. It does not contain any of the indicators of alarmist framing.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q2 is unequivocally \"no.\"\nHere's my JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment 'Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.' does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or critical alert phrases as defined by Q2. It is a factual statement of non-disclosure.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a moderate verb from the specified list paired with scale/impact information.", "thoughts": "**Decision Tree Analysis: Q3 - \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and tasked with analyzing it against Q3 of the framing analysis decision tree. My initial focus is on whether this segment triggers the 'moderate verb + significant scale/impact' condition.\n\nFirst, I quickly identify the verb: \"would not disclose.\"  Then, I consult the Q3 definition, reviewing the list of qualifying 'moderate verbs'. \"Would not disclose\" isn't on that list. Next, I scan for the crucial 'scale/impact' data.  While the text mentions \"the size of the flock in Kentucky,\" it's about what was *withheld*, not about presenting actual impactful scale information *with* a moderate verb. I see no direct mention of surging numbers or plummeting losses, for example.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental condition for Q3 isn't met. The segment doesn't contain a moderate verb from the defined list, *paired* with concrete scale or impact information.  My answer is a definitive \"no.\"  The framing analysis for this segment, regarding Q3, is negative."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement, not a question, and therefore cannot be a loaded rhetorical question.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to assess the statement \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" against Q4, which focuses on identifying loaded rhetorical questions that try to whip up alarm.\n\nMy first thought is to really *dig in* to this. Let's see... the segment itself is a straightforward declarative statement. It's simply reporting a lack of information – a non-disclosure. It's not phrased as a question, and it certainly doesn't try to sound loaded.\n\nNow, Q4 highlights key indicators of alarmist rhetorical questions: it's looking for questions that intentionally inject fear, urgency, or a sense of impending doom. It provides clear examples of those types of questions. Contrast that with this sentence, and the difference is obvious. There's no attempt to manipulate the audience's emotions here. It’s just a statement of fact.\n\nSince there's no question in the segment, the whole premise of Q4 - checking for rhetorical elements - doesn't apply. Therefore, the answer is unequivocally \"no.\" Now, on to Q5..."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text reports a lack of disclosure and contains no language explicitly designed to calm concerns or assure safety.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for an Explicit Calming Cue (Q5)**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've been tasked with assessing the text \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" against Question Q5 of the 12-step decision tree. This question boils down to: is there an explicit calming cue here, some kind of reassurance explicitly aimed at reducing concern?\n\nMy assessment is straightforward. The text is just a factual report – a simple statement of non-disclosure. There's absolutely nothing in there that fits the profile of an explicit calming cue. I'm looking for phrases like \"no need to worry,\" \"everything is under control,\" or anything that directly aims to reassure the public. I'm not seeing any of that.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q5 is definitely \"no.\"\n\nHere's the JSON response I'll provide:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The text reports a lack of disclosure and contains no language explicitly designed to calm concerns or assure safety.\"\n}\n```\nAnd now, it's on to the next question, assuming the prompt goes further, since Q5 is negative."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment 'Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky' contains no minimiser or scale contrast cues required for Q6.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Question Q6**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky,\" and I need to determine if it aligns with Q6 of the decision tree. That means I have to check for the presence of a \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" used for reassurance.\n\nFirst, I need to break down what that means. I'm looking for a minimizer word – something like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" etc. – and then a clear contrast, usually implying a larger scale or context. The whole point is to see if these elements combine to create a reassuring effect for the reader.\n\nLet's dive into the segment: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\" Right off the bat, I see no minimizer. There's nothing like \"only\" or \"just\" here.  Nor do I see any contrasting elements.  The segment simply states a lack of disclosure.  There is no attempt to downplay the significance of the flock size or the lack of disclosure.\n\nConsequently, given the absence of both a minimizer and a scale contrast, I have to conclude that this segment does *not* satisfy the criteria for Q6.  Therefore, my answer is a definitive \"no.\""}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains a negation ('would not disclose') but it is not a 'bare negation' as defined by Q7, which focuses on negating risks, problems, or negative findings. It states a factual action regarding disclosure.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" Against Q7**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" and need to assess it against Q7, which deals with \"bare negations\" – essentially, negations that downplay or deny a risk or problem.\n\nFirst, the obvious: \"would not disclose\" is a clear negation. They *aren't* disclosing. Now, Q7's examples are crucial here: things like \"not expected to cause problems\" or \"tests were negative.\" These examples are all about *denying* or downplaying a potential negative outcome.\n\nMy initial thought is that \"would not disclose\" doesn't quite fit. It's about an action (or inaction) – withholding information. Sure, that *could* be relevant to a problem, like if they're hiding something about the flock that might suggest a risk. But the segment itself doesn't explicitly *connect* to a risk. It's just a statement of fact. They're refusing to disclose, but *why* isn't stated.\n\nThe crux of it is this: Q7 targets negations that directly deny or downplay a *problem*. \"Would not disclose\" is a refusal to share information. It's a statement about their actions, not a direct negation of a risk.\n\nTherefore, because this isn't a negation that's downplaying a risk like the Q7 examples, I conclude that this segment does *not* contain a \"bare negation\" as defined by Q7. My answer is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a lack of disclosure, not capabilities, preparedness, safeguards, or future possibilities.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" and asked to assess it against question Q8 of the decision tree. Q8 is looking for descriptions of capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, *without* those things being explicitly tied to current calm, safety, or risk minimization.\n\nImmediately, I see this isn't about any of those things. It's simply a statement about a company withholding information.  It doesn't describe any capabilities, like \"we can do this.\" It's not about preparedness, like \"we're ready.\" There are no hints of hopeful possibilities or safeguards here.  So, based on my understanding of Q8, the answer has to be \"no\".\n\nTo be thorough, I'm checking the specific examples in my understanding of the Q8 criteria.  \"Vaccine can be made,\" \"officials are working,\" \"systems are in place\" - none of those apply here. \"Tyson Foods would not disclose\" is a statement of *lack* of action, not the presence of capability or foresight.\n\nTherefore, the JSON output needs to be: `{\"answer\":\"no\", \"rationale\":\"The segment describes a lack of disclosure, not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.\"}`  The rationale is concise, accurate, and within the required token limit. That's it, the analysis is complete."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a lack of disclosure ('would not disclose') rather than reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Question Q9**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" and need to assess it against Question Q9 of that decision tree. My initial thought is that the segment *does* mention a numerical concept, the \"size of the flock.\" However, Q9 focuses on *reporting* numerical metrics, specifically using descriptive verbs like \"increased\" or \"decreased.\"\n\nHere, the key verb is \"would not disclose.\" That's not a verb of reporting a number or its change; it's about *withholding* information. It's an action, not a numerical description. I'm looking for direct reporting of a metric, and this isn't that. I'm also mindful that Q9 explicitly looks for standard descriptive verbs, not ones that suggest refusal or avoidance.\n\nFurthermore, there are no vivid verbs or alarmist language. So, it's not a case of the segment *trying* to be dramatic or paint a specific economic picture. I'm confident in saying that the primary function of this segment isn't to report a price, economic data, or metric in the way Q9 is looking for. Thus, the answer is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a fact about non-disclosure and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment: Q10**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\" My task is to see if this passage speculates about any potential future relief or improvement, but without using any calming cues about the present.\n\nLooking closely, the segment simply reports a past action: Tyson Foods' refusal to disclose information. It doesn't hint at future conditions, easing pressures, or any kind of hopeful predictions. There's no language of \"might,\" \"could,\" \"will,\" or any other phrasing that points towards future improvement. Instead, it's a straightforward statement about the absence of information.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q10 is a definitive \"no.\" The segment doesn't speculate about future relief or improvement. The rationale is clear: it's a factual statement about past non-disclosure, not a forecast about future conditions. We move on to the next question in the decision tree when it comes up."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports an action by Tyson Foods but does not contain a direct quote or attributed statement with explicit framing language.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this segment and need to assess it against question Q11 of the decision tree. Q11 is all about whether a directly quoted source is providing a dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame.  My initial focus is on the quotes, of course.\n\nFirst, I quickly scan for any direct quotes, any text wrapped in quotation marks. Nope, nothing like that here. Okay, so that's the first hurdle cleared.\n\nNext, I need to see if there's *attributed* speech that could potentially contain framing.  The segment mentions \"Tyson Foods would not disclose...\" and this is clearly attributable. But then I have to ask myself, is this *framing*? Not really. It's reporting a lack of information, a *reported action*, not a *statement of opinion* or a stance that would be construed as particularly alarmist or reassuring. It's just a neutral, factual observation.\n\nSo, since there's no directly quoted material, and the attributed statement doesn't contain any framing, the answer to Q11 is definitively \"no.\" I'll need to move onto the next question (which would be Q12 in the actual decision tree), although the instructions don't give me the specific rules for it. But the logic is clear. My JSON response will have to reflect that \"no\" answer, and I'll need to make sure my rationale is solid, something like, \"The segment lacks directly quoted material and the attributed statement does not provide a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame.\" That should cover it."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit framing cues; segment reports a factual lack of disclosure neutrally.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the final check, Q12. The task is to determine if the segment \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" contains any remaining, explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues. I've already systematically ruled out the higher-level framing indicators, from Intensifiers to explicit calming language.\n\nHere's my thought process: Initially, \"would not disclose\" pinged my radar because of the \"bare negation\" rule (Q5). It's a clear statement *about* a non-action – Tyson Foods *not* disclosing information. However, this is a very factual statement. It doesn't use vivid verbs, isn't an intensifier, doesn't exaggerate scale, and doesn't explicitly attempt to calm or reassure. It's essentially a straightforward report of what *didn't* happen. Reaching Q12 confirms that none of the more specific rules flagged this as either Alarmist or Reassuring.\n\nUltimately, the segment's neutral presentation fits the criteria for Neutral framing. There are no explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues. The segment is a simple declarative statement of fact.  Q12 confirms a neutral classification."}
