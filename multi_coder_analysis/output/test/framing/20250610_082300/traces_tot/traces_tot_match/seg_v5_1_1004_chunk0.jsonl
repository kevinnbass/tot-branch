{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective from the specified list. 'highly pathogenic' is part of the technical disease name (HPAI), and 'significant' modifies 'losses' (an outcome), not a risk-adjective."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The phrase 'on high alert' is a critical alert phrase that triggers Alarmist when a threat ('avian influenza', 'outbreaks') is mentioned nearby.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment for Alarmist Indicators**\n\nOkay, I'm examining this text snippet to see if it triggers an \"Alarmist\" classification based on the decision tree. My goal is to determine if Q2 is satisfied. That means I'm looking for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert\" near a threat mention.\n\nLet's break it down: \"U.S. poultry producers are on high alert after cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have cropped up in multiple states, sparking fears that further outbreaks could cause significant losses.\"\n\n*   **High-potency verbs:** \"Cropped up\" isn't high-potency, and \"sparking fears\" is a consequence. \"Cause\" isn't a strong action in \"could cause significant losses.\" The phrase \"significant losses\" might be Q3 territory.\n*   **Potent metaphors:** No metaphors here.\n*   **Superlative + negative noun:** Nope, no such combo.\n*   **Critical alert phrase:** \"On high alert!\" Bingo. And guess what? We have the threat right there: \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\" and \"outbreaks.\" The regex matches because the phrase is there with a threat nearby.\n\nThe key is \"on high alert.\" That phrase, combined with the mention of a clear threat, satisfies Q2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"yes.\"\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"yes\", \"rationale\": \"The segment includes the critical alert phrase \\\"on high alert\\\" and mentions the threat of outbreaks.\"}\n```"}
