seg_v5_11_1001_chunk0,Neutral,Frame determined by Q7 trigger. Rationale: 'Human infection is rare' is a bare negation/downplaying statement without an explicit calming cue.,"[{""Q"": 1, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**Analyzing the Segment Against Q1**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this phrase, \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal,\"" and my job is to see if it triggers Q1.  Q1 is all about intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives, right?  The goal is to identify exaggerated language around risk.\n\nLet's break it down. \""Rare\"" jumps out, but that's a frequency term, not a risk-adjective like \""dangerous\"" or \""lethal.\"" It's about how often something happens, not the severity of it.  Then we have \""infected animal,\"" which I immediately parse as relevant but doesn't fit the Q1 list of specific risk terms.\n\nFinally, I scan for intensifiers (\""very,\"" \""extremely\"") or comparatives (\""more,\"" \""deadlier\"") to gauge whether the language is being deliberately amped up, but there are none.\n\nTherefore, considering the specific criteria of Q1, this segment *doesn't* meet the mark. The term \""rare\"" doesn't trigger the test, and there aren't any modifying intensifiers or comparatives related to a risk adjective.  It's a straightforward statement of potential risk, not an amplified one.\n""}, {""Q"": 2, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""The segment uses neutral language ('is rare', 'can occur') and does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases listed in Q2."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**Q2 Analysis: A Clear \""No\""**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"" The task is to apply Q2 of the 12-step decision tree. This means I'm looking for specific red flags \u2013 those language patterns that amp up the alarm bells.\n\nFirst, I quickly scan for high-potency verbs like \""devastated\"" or \""skyrocketed\"" \u2013 nothing. Then, I check for those superlatives paired with negative nouns, like \""worst crisis\"" or \""most expensive disaster\"" \u2013 still nothing. Next, I look for that classic \""on high alert\"" phrase \u2013 nope, not there. Finally, I'm on the lookout for potent metaphors like \""ticking time-bomb\"" \u2013 and, well, nada.\n\nThis text is using pretty straightforward, neutral language. \""Rare,\"" \""can occur,\"" \""close contact\"" \u2013 it's all factual and devoid of those framing devices that make Q2 concerned. The absence of these linguistic indicators means, definitively, that the answer to Q2 is \""no\"". Now, it's time to move on to Q3.\n""}, {""Q"": 3, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""The segment does not contain any moderate verbs from the specified list paired with explicit scale or impact information."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**Analyzing the Statement Against Decision Tree Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at the phrase \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"" and I need to assess it against Q3 of my decision tree. That means I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, I identify the verbs: \""is\"" and \""can occur.\"" Now, I mentally run those against the moderate verb list. \""Is\"" and \""can occur\"" aren't on it; they don't match anything like \""hit,\"" \""swept,\"" or the others that I'm looking for. They're pretty neutral.\n\nNext, I need to check for that crucial connection to significant scale or impact. The phrase mentions \""rare\"" and \""close contact.\"" \""Rare\"" clearly indicates low likelihood, and \""close contact\"" describes a *condition*, not a large-scale event. It's not paired with terms that signal significant impact, like \""millions,\"" \""thousands,\"" or a record-breaking number.\n\nSince I don't see any moderate verbs from the list and the impact/scale isn't there, the answer to Q3 is definitively \""no.\"" It's time to move on to Q4.\n""}, {""Q"": 4, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain a question."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**Evaluating for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a statement and tasked with determining if it uses a loaded rhetorical question, specifically as outlined in Q4. I need to focus on whether the text segment, \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal,\"" functions as an alarmist question in disguise.\n\nAnalyzing the segment, I quickly recognize it as a straightforward declarative statement. It's not phrased as a question, and therefore, it cannot be a rhetorical question, loaded or otherwise.\n\nMy response to Q4 is clear: \""No.\"" The rationale is simple: the provided segment does not contain a question. It is a factual statement.\n""}, {""Q"": 5, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""The segment states that infection is 'rare' but lacks explicit calming language or an intensified low-risk evaluation required for Q5."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**Assessing Reassuring Language in the Segment**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to look at the phrase \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal\"" and see if it meets the criteria for Q5. Q5, as I understand it, is looking for explicit reassurances, the kind that actively attempt to calm anxieties. Think phrases like \""don't worry,\"" \""perfectly safe,\"" or declarations of complete control.\n\nFirst, I parsed the segment. It basically states the infection is uncommon but *possible* with close contact. Now, Q5 is very specific. It wants those overt calming cues. It's looking for those strong intensifiers like \""very,\"" \""extremely,\"" or \""exceptionally\"" modifying the risk itself, or outright declarations of safety or control.\n\nI looked for those key patterns. While \""rare\"" hints at a low frequency, it's not the same. It's not paired with an intensifier to frame the risk as actively low, like in the pattern the model looks for: `(risk|likelihood|chance)\\s+...\\s+(?:very|extremely|exceptionally|remarkably)\\s+low`.  There are no other explicit calming phrases, no statements about the situation being under control, no specific consumption safety assurances.\n\nBasically, while the segment states a fact about rarity, it doesn't *frame* that fact to *reassure*. It just states it. There's no active attempt to calm or reassure using the specific language Q5 is looking for. So, the answer to Q5 is a definite \""no.\""\n""}, {""Q"": 6, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""The segment uses 'rare' but lacks a specified minimiser token (only, just, merely, a single, few) and an explicit scale contrast."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**Evaluating for Minimizer + Scale Contrast (Q6)**\n\nOkay, so I need to check if the statement \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal\"" meets the criteria for Q6, which is all about minimizers and scale contrast for reassurance. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I identified the segment and zeroed in on the use of \""rare.\""  Now, while \""rare\"" certainly implies a low probability, the rules I'm working with are very specific. They require certain *specific* minimizer tokens: 'only,' 'just,' 'merely,' 'a single,' or 'few.' \""Rare\"" isn't on that list. This is key.\n\nNext, I looked for any kind of scale contrast, like, say, \""rare *among* thousands of exposures,\"" or something similar that contextualizes \""rare\"" within a larger scope. But there's nothing like that here. No comparison to a larger population, no frame of reference that explicitly highlights the rarity *in relation to* something else.\n\nSo, when I consider Q6 holistically, it's clear: both elements, the specified minimizer *and* the scale contrast, are absent. The word \""rare\"" isn't a required minimizer, and there's no scale context provided.  Therefore, the answer is definitively \""no.\"" Q6 is not satisfied by this segment.\n""}, {""Q"": 7, ""answer"": ""yes"", ""rationale"": ""'Human infection is rare' is a bare negation/downplaying statement without an explicit calming cue."", ""via"": ""llm"", ""regex"": null, ""thoughts"": ""**Q7 Evaluation: \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\""**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My task is to analyze \""Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal\"" against Q7, specifically looking for a \""bare negation\"" without a calming cue.\n\nFirst, I see the core of the issue: \""Human infection is rare.\"" This jumps out immediately. Q7 focuses on language that downplays or minimizes a potential risk.  \""Rare\"" is precisely that \u2013 it suggests a low probability. It's essentially the same as saying \""unlikely\"" or \""not expected frequently,\"" which the Q7 guidance explicitly flags as potential \""expectation negations\"" that lead to a neutral frame. We've seen similar phrases downplayed effectively, like *unlikely to affect* or *doesn't pose a risk*.\n\nNow, the crucial question is whether this downplaying is \""bare,\"" meaning unaccompanied by a calming cue.  The rest of the sentence, \""but can occur after close contact with an infected animal,\"" doesn't *calm* anything.  It simply acknowledges a condition for the event.  It doesn't say something like \""so don't worry\"" or \""meaning the risk is negligible.\"" It simply states a condition that is rare in comparison to the general population.\n\nThus, I believe \""Human infection is rare\"" *is* a bare negation. It downplays the risk without providing any explicit reassurance or context to suggest the low likelihood should be taken casually. This aligns perfectly with the criteria for a \""yes\"" response to Q7.\n""}]"
