{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. The phrase 'immediate public health concern' uses 'immediate' temporally, and the overall statement is one of low risk.", "thoughts": "**Initial Assessment: Q1 - Intensifier of Risk-Adjective**\n\nOkay, here's my assessment. The task is to determine if the text segment contains an intensifier or a comparative adjective modifying a risk-related adjective, as defined by the provided rules and regex. Based on my expert understanding of this claim-framing process, here's what I've found:\n\nFirst, I examined the segment for phrases that fit the criteria. The phrase \"strongest AI surveillance program\" stands out. While \"strongest\" is indeed a superlative, it modifies \"surveillance program,\" which, while related to monitoring and potential risk reduction, is not a direct risk-adjective itself. It's describing the *strength* of the surveillance, not the *severity* of a risk.\n\nNext, I looked at \"actively look for the disease.\" \"Actively\" modifies \"look,\" not a risk-related word. Then there's \"immediate public health concern.\" Here, \"immediate\" qualifies \"public health concern,\" but \"immediate\" functions temporally, downplaying the present impact, rather than amplifying the degree of the concern. That context feels more relevant for explicit calming in a downstream question.\n\nI then ran the segment against the regex pattern. My analysis indicated no direct matches with the pattern, given that I defined the relationship between the intensifiers and the risk adjectives. I considered the context of the sentence \"do not present an immediate public health concern.\" This is actually a statement *diminishing* risk, not amplifying it.\n\nTherefore, after thorough analysis, I conclude that Q1's condition is *not* met. The segment doesn't contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective as defined by the criteria and pattern. I will answer \"no\" to Q1. The process should then proceed to Q2."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase 'on high alert' as defined in Q2 rules.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Alarmist Language: Q2 Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with assessing this text snippet against the second question of the 12-step decision tree. Essentially, I need to see if it uses any of the \"alarmist\" language we're looking for, specifically focusing on the presence of high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative noun combinations, or the \"on high alert\" phrase, to frame the situation as particularly concerning.\n\nScanning the text, the first thing that jumps out is the sentence: \"The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world...\"  While \"strongest\" is a superlative, it modifies the neutral noun \"program,\" not something like \"disaster\" or \"crisis.\" So, that's a pass on the \"Superlative + Negative Noun\" rule.\n\nNext, I'm looking for those high-impact verbs. I see \"USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease...\".  \"Actively look\" isn't on my list of potent verbs. I'm also on the lookout for phrases like \"raging inferno,\" \"ticking time bomb,\" or anything signaling an immediate, serious threat.  Nothing along those lines. And finally, I'm checking for that \"on high alert\" phrase with a threat keyword, but it's not present either.\n\nThe final part of the text, \"...these virus detections [of bird flu] do not present an immediate public health concern,\" is actually a statement about low risk, which will likely be flagged by Q4 (Reassuring Cue), but it's not a Q2 flag.\n\nBased on my analysis, I've found no elements that trigger Q2's \"Alarmist Language\" criteria.  Therefore, my answer is \"no,\" and I'm ready to move on to question three. I will output the Q2 JSON accordingly."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text does not contain any of the specified 'moderate verbs' paired with scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Against Alarmist Frame Criteria (Q3)**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of the provided text segment, focusing on Q3 and its criteria. I need to determine if this section exhibits an \"Alarmist\" frame based on the presence of \"moderate verbs\" paired with \"significant scale or impact\" information.\n\nFirst, I identify the text to be evaluated: \"The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations,' it [APHIS] added. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added Monday that these virus detections [of bird flu] do not present an immediate public health concern.\"\n\nNext, I need to look for specific \"moderate verbs\" from our pre-approved list ( `hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|culled(?!\\s+(?:flock|flocks|birds?|poultry))`) and link them to indicators of significant scale or impact. The key is that these verbs must denote *realized* impact, not just future plans or hypothetical situations.\n\nScanning the text, I see the following verbs: \"has,\" \"working,\" \"look for,\" \"added,\" and \"present.\" None of these verbs are on the moderate verb list. Therefore, I can confidently say that the Q3 condition is *not* met. No moderate verbs, as defined by the criteria, are present within the text.\n\nSo, the answer to Q3 is \"no.\" This text segment does not meet the requirements of Q3 as defined for an \"Alarmist\" frame.\n\nHere's the result formatted as JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"No moderate verbs from the specified list (hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|culled(?!\\s+(?:flock|flocks|birds?|poultry)) were present in the text segment.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text contains no questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Q4 Analysis: Absence of Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with evaluating this text against Q4 of the decision tree, which is about loaded rhetorical questions implying alarm.  I need to see if the author or a quoted source *poses* such a question.  I read the text: \"The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program... ...public health concern.\" The first sentence talks about surveillance, and the second is a CDC statement reassuring the public. Hmm, no questions anywhere. Not even subtly implied ones. Therefore, my answer is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statement 'do not present an immediate public health concern' is a bare negation, explicitly excluded by Q5 rules as not being an explicit calming cue. The APHIS statement describes capabilities but lacks explicit calming language.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Reassuring Cues (Q5)**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've got this text segment and I need to determine if it contains any explicit calming cues, according to the Q5 criteria in the decision tree. Q5 is all about identifying reassuring language like direct safety assurances, preparedness statements, low-risk evaluations, and positive amplifications. I'm focusing on \"explicit\" cues, not implicit ones.\n\nI've broken down the text and the criteria. I see two parts: APHIS highlighting their AI surveillance and active searching, and the CDC statement about bird flu detections not being an \"immediate public health concern.\"\n\nFirst, I looked at that CDC statement. The Q5 rules are clear on this. That phrase, \"do not present an immediate public health concern,\" is a bare negation. The rules explicitly state this is *not* a calming cue. It's considered Neutral, and it's flagged as an example of what *not* to consider a reassurance under Q5. This falls under the realm of bare negation, which directs me to consider Q7, but not Q5. So, that part's a firm \"no.\"\n\nThen I went back to APHIS's statement. They talk about having the \"strongest AI surveillance program\" and actively searching. That's a positive statement about their capabilities, which is good, but it's not a reassuring statement. It doesn't use any of the direct safety assurance phrasing like \"no cause for alarm\" or \"public can rest easy.\" It's great to hear about their efforts, but it doesn't meet any of the specific criteria listed for Q5. Sure, it's positive, but it's not framed *as* an explicit calming cue in the context of *current* public safety.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, neither of these statements contains language that directly qualifies as an explicit calming cue under Q5. Therefore, the answer is no; this text segment doesn't contain any reassuring cues as defined by Q5."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a 'minimiser' word (only, just, merely, a single, few) combined with an explicit 'scale contrast' (out of, among, outnumber) to downplay significance.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" Reassurance Pattern**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with checking this text against Question 6, specifically looking for that \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" reassurance pattern. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the text. It reads: \"The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations,\" and then: \"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added Monday that these virus detections [of bird flu] do not present an immediate public health concern.\" Got it.\n\nNow, against Q6, I'm checking for that specific combination. Does the text use a minimizer like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" or phrases like \"a single\" or \"few?\" Nope, nothing there. Then, does it employ a scale contrast, using words like \"out of,\" \"among,\" or \"outnumber\" to diminish something? Still no. The pattern requires both. So, it fails at the first hurdle.\n\nI've already consulted the Q6 pattern recognition table and detailed requirements. The text doesn't match the criteria. I've also reviewed the few-shot examples for this type of reassurance, and it's definitely not a match. Finally, I've run it against the regex pattern, `\\b(?:only|just|merely|a\\s+single|few)\\b.{0,40}\\b(?:out\\s+of|among|outnumber)\\b`. And as expected, the regex doesn't hit either.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion for Q6 is clear: the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern isn't present in this text. The answer is \"no\". Now, I'm ready to format the output."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'do not present an immediate public health concern' is a bare negation without an explicit calming cue, matching the Q7 pattern.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment against Q7**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this segment, focusing on Q7. My initial read of the provided text, \"...The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added Monday that these virus detections [of bird flu] do not present an immediate public health concern,\" tells me this is something I need to look at.\n\nMy first step is to focus on that \"do not present an immediate public health concern\" piece. I know that Q7 looks for \"bare negations\" – statements that deny a risk without explicitly calming the reader. I have to see if this fits the pattern.\n\nI consult Q7's rules, and it clearly lists examples of the type of language it's looking for. I am using my expert knowledge of the language here, but I know a bare negation when I see one. I note how the example provided in Q7's instructions is helpful: \"`The cases do not present an immediate public-health concern.` → Neutral (bare negation).\" This looks an awful lot like what I am seeing.\n\nChecking my mental list, I also confirm there is no explicit calming phrase *after* the negation. No comforting words, no \"so don't worry\" type phrase. Therefore, I can safely apply the Q7 logic: this segment contains a bare negation (\"do not present an immediate public health concern\") and lacks an explicit calming cue. The answer is \"yes.\"\n\nBased on the rules, since the answer is \"yes,\" the frame for this is \"Neutral.\" I'm also confirming that I have not missed an alarmist tone, nor am I misinterpreting a reassuring tone. Given the structure of the prompt, I stop here; no more hops are needed. Finally, I confirm that the output will be pure JSON."}
