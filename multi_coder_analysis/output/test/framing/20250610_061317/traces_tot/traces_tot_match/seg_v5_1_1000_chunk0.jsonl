{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'highly' modifying the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: A Close Match**\n\nOkay, so I'm evaluating this text snippet against the first question of the decision tree. Q1 is straightforward: it's looking for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly preceding a risk-adjective.  I'm focusing specifically on phrases like \"very dangerous\" or \"more lethal.\"\n\nLooking at the segment, \"Health officials announced Monday that they detected a highly contagious strain of bird flu in two additional U.S. states, furthering a threat to the country's poultry industry,\" my eye immediately zeroes in on \"highly contagious.\"  \"Highly\" is a textbook intensifier â€“ it's there to amplify the inherent risk of the adjective it modifies. \"Contagious,\" as we know, is absolutely a risk-adjective; it's right there on the approved list.\n\nThe pattern \"highly contagious\" is a perfect match for the \"Intensifier + Risk-Adjective\" rule. In fact, that specific example is even mentioned explicitly in the decision tree as a cue leading to an \"Alarmist\" classification. My regex also flags `highly\\s+(deadly|lethal|dangerous|severe|catastrophic|brutal|contagious|virulent|destructive)`, of course.\n\nTherefore, the presence of the phrase \"highly contagious\" confirms a \"yes\" answer to Q1. The rationale will highlight that specific phrase as the key evidence. This is a clear indicator."}
