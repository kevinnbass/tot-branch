{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'particularly' modifies the risk-adjective 'brutal'.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Alarmist Frame Detected**\n\nOkay, so I'm analyzing this text snippet against the first question of our decision tree. The goal is to see if an intensifier or comparative adjective is directly modifying a risk-related adjective.  The segment provided is: \"The winter of 2020 was particularly brutal, causing a shortage in the domestic supply of poultry livestock.\"\n\nMy initial thought is to identify the crucial components.  I recognize \"particularly\" as an intensifier, and \"brutal\" as a risk-adjective. Checking my mental database of rules, I quickly confirm that \"brutal\" *is* on the list of risk-adjectives used by Q1. So, here's what I've got: \"particularly brutal\". This perfectly fits the \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj\" pattern we're looking for! That is a big cue.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is a definite \"yes\".\n\nGiven the precedence ladder in our methodology, a \"yes\" here means we're flagging this segment as potentially using the Alarmist frame. I'll need to format the answer as a JSON object, clearly stating the \"yes\" answer and the rationale, which will quote the decisive phrase: \"particularly brutal.\""}
