{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Segment: \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess the phrase \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states\" based on Q1 of the decision tree. My task is to determine if this segment contains an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nFirst, I identified the key components. \"Outbreaks\" is a negative indicator, but not a risk adjective itself. \"Detected\" is a verb, but it doesn't fall into the category of vivid verbs describing impact, which is what Q2 focuses on. The phrase \"more than a dozen states\" describes the scale or the metric of the outbreak, but it doesn't align with the criteria of Q3, which looks for a moderate verb combined with a scale/metric.\n\nNow, focusing on Q1: I checked for intensifiers – things like \"very\" or \"extremely.\" There were none present. I also looked for comparative adjectives directly modifying risk-adjectives, things like \"more deadly\" or \"deadlier.\" Again, nothing. The word \"more\" did appear, but it's part of the phrase \"more than a dozen,\" which serves to quantify the affected states. It doesn't function as a comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective. There are no risk-adjectives like \"dangerous\" or \"catastrophic\" in the segment to be modified in the first place.\n\nConsequently, based on the absence of the pattern described in Q1, my response to the question is a clear \"no.\" My rationale? The phrase doesn't contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. The \"more\" present is simply part of a quantitative phrase."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the neutral verb 'detected' and lacks high-potency verbs, metaphors, or other Q2 cues.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: A Straightforward 'No'**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze, and the task is to see if it triggers Question 2 of this decision tree. Q2 is all about spotting the red flags – those high-potency verbs, spicy metaphors, superlative-negative combos, or that \"on high alert\" phrase, especially when threat keywords are hanging around.\n\nLet's dive in. The segment is: \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\" Right off the bat, \"detected\" jumps out. Is it a powerhouse verb like \"decimated\" or \"exploded?\" Nah, it's just factual, like reporting the presence of something. It's a neutral verb – the kind you'd expect in a report.\n\nNo metaphors, nothing metaphorical at all.  The phrase \"more than a dozen states\" points to a wide scope, but it isn't amplified with any embellishments or hyperbole. And, of course, no \"on high alert\" anywhere.\n\nSo, according to my expert analysis, the answer is a clear \"no\" to Question 2. There are simply no linguistic cues here that would indicate it should be flagged."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'detected' is a plain factual verb, not one of the specified 'moderate verbs' required by Q3.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Evaluation - A Quick Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states,\" with Q3 in mind. My initial step is always to nail down the verb. Here, it's \"detected.\" Now, the trick is to see if that verb, \"detected,\" is one of the 'moderate' ones we're looking for, the ones that suggest significant scale or impact. I need to check it against that list: `\\b(hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|culled(?!\\s+(?:flock|flocks|birds?|poultry)))\\b`.\n\nRight away, \"detected\" doesn't fit the bill. It's a factual statement of finding something. The text *does* mention scale, \"more than a dozen states,\" but according to the Q3 rules and my understanding of that 60-Second Cue Cheat-Sheet, it's the *combination* of a moderate verb *and* scale that triggers the rule. \"Detected\" just isn't moderate enough.  So, based on the criteria, the answer is a clear \"no.\" The \"detected\" verb doesn't meet the requirements for Q3, even though scale is present."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement of fact, not a question, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, I'm ready to tackle this. The task is to evaluate the text segment, \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states,\" against Question Q4. My expertise comes into play here, so I'm thinking critically.\n\nFirst, I need to understand Q4's scope. It's looking for loaded rhetorical questions that create a sense of alarm. The examples they provided highlight the specific type of phrasing we're watching for. Neutral questions, on the other hand, are focused on information gathering.\n\nNow, let's look at the segment itself. \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\" Right away, it's clear: this is a declarative statement, a simple presentation of fact. There's no question here at all. Absolutely *no* question.\n\nSo, how can a *statement* be a loaded *rhetorical question*? The logic of Q4 simply doesn't apply. It's like asking if a chair can fly. The very nature of the input precludes it from fitting the criteria.\n\nThat means, the answer to Q4 has to be a resounding \"no.\" And, according to the instructions, that sends me along to Q5. Now, I have to ensure the response adheres to the JSON format. Easy enough."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (outbreaks detected) but contains no explicit calming language or assurance of safety/control from the author or a source.", "thoughts": "**Q5 Evaluation: No Explicit Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze for Q5, which means I'm looking specifically for explicit reassurance. The prompt is \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\" My expert intuition immediately flags that as a statement of fact, a potentially concerning one, but fact nonetheless. The Q5 rules stipulate that I'm looking for language *explicitly* communicating safety, control, or reduced risk. Words like \"no need to worry,\" \"situation contained,\" or \"risk minimized\" would be what I'm looking for. This segment contains *none* of those. It simply reports the existence of outbreaks. It's neutral, even if the information itself is inherently negative. Consequently, based on my understanding of Q5 and my professional judgment, my answer is a definitive \"no.\" I'm now ready to move onto Q6, but only need to provide the JSON for Q5 as instructed."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment 'Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states' lacks both a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) and an explicit scale contrast ('out of X') required for this rule.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text's Reassurance Potential**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment, \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states,\" and I need to assess it against Q6, specifically looking for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern used for reassurance. Here's my breakdown:\n\nFirst, I recognize that Q6 is all about seeing a minimizer word (like \"only\" or \"just\") paired with a clear scale contrast (e.g., \"out of 50 states\"). The goal here is to downplay something by presenting it as a small part of a larger whole.\n\nWhen I look at the segment, I see \"more than a dozen states\". That's a quantity, a scale of sorts, but it's not being used in a contrasting way. It isn't being explicitly compared to a larger number or total. I need to see something like \"only a few states out of all 50\" or \"just a dozen among thousands of counties\".\n\nThe phrase \"more than a dozen\" doesn't serve as a minimizer. It doesn't signal smallness in the reassuring sense. We need a direct way to downplay the number, and we're just not seeing that.\n\nTherefore, since the segment lacks both the necessary minimizer and a contextually relevant scale contrast working together, my conclusion is clear: Q6 is not met. The answer is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment 'Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states' does not contain a bare negation. It states a positive fact (outbreaks detected).", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at the phrase \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\" My task is to determine if this sentence constitutes a \"bare negation\" according to question Q7. This means I need to check for specific patterns of negation, like those indicating a lack of impact or negative test results.\n\nFirst, I examine the sentence itself. It's a straightforward statement of fact: outbreaks have been found. There's no negating word or phrase, no \"not,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no,\" or similar. The sentence is purely affirmative.\n\nTherefore, since the phrase doesn't contain any of the negation cues Q7 specifies, it does *not* constitute a bare negation. My answer to Q7 is a clear \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the sentence presents a positive observation rather than negating any event or outcome."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a current negative fact (outbreaks detected), not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states\" Regarding Question Q8**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants me to assess the phrase \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states\" against Question Q8. This question, as I understand it, is looking for statements that describe some form of capability, preparedness, or positive future possibility, *without* linking them to any current assurance of safety or calm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the segment itself. \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states\" is a statement of fact: it describes the current situation of disease spread.\n\nNow, let's go down the Q8 checklist. Does it describe capabilities? No. Does it describe preparedness measures? No. Hopeful future possibilities? Nope. Implemented safeguards? Definitely not. This isn't about what we *can* do, what we *have* done, or what we *hope* to do. It's simply a statement about what *is* happening. The segment describes a current negative situation: the detection of outbreaks.\n\nTherefore, this statement doesn't fit the criteria of Q8. The segment describes a current negative fact, not capability/preparedness or hopeful future possibilities without active reassurance. My answer to Q8 is, therefore, \"no.\" I'm now ready to formulate the JSON output as required."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports on health outbreaks, not prices, economic data, or financial metrics as defined by Q9.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Segment \"Outbreaks Detected\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to evaluate the phrase \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states\" against the criteria for question Q9. Q9 focuses on whether a segment is primarily reporting prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics using neutral language, basically without any \"framing\" or alarmist language.\n\nMy initial thought is that this segment *does* involve a numerical metric: the number of states. However, it's not strictly about economics, which seems to be the main focus of Q9. I need to dive deeper.\n\nI've broken it down: We're dealing with \"outbreaks,\" which is definitely a negative concept. We also have a numerical element – \"more than a dozen states.\" And then the verb \"detected.\" The core question is whether \"detected\" is a \"standard descriptive verb\" in this context, or if it constitutes some form of framing.\n\nNow, Q9 wants \"standard descriptive verbs\" and avoids \"vivid\" or \"potent\" verbs, along with risk adjectives. \"Detected\" isn't exactly like \"increased\" or \"rose,\" but it's not a flashy word either. It reports a fact. It's a neutral verb, describing *how* the metric was obtained, not the metric itself.\n\nThe key here is the *economic* focus of Q9. The question seems geared towards price fluctuations, revenue, and other economic indicators. The examples and guidelines are all about economic terms. This segment, while containing a number, is about a health issue, not economic data. This feels like it's outside the scope of Q9, and thus, I can't apply the criteria correctly.\n\nI've reviewed the core principles, too: the \"Bedrock Principle\" and the \"Symmetry Rule\". The fact is negative (\"outbreaks\"), but the presentation is factual. The segment isn't amplifying anything. \"Detected in more than a dozen states\" is a statement of fact, not an alarm.\n\nSince Q9 is focused on economic reporting, and this is about a public health issue, it doesn't fit the criteria. I have to say \"no\" to Q9. And, I understand that my next step is to evaluate this text against Q10 (which is a separate question)."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a current situation ('Outbreaks have been detected') and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Q10 Evaluation: A Thought Process**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with applying Q10 of a decision tree to the text segment \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\" Q10 wants me to determine if this segment speculates about future relief or improvement *without* an explicit calming cue about the present.\n\nMy initial thought is, does this segment even *remotely* hint at future relief? No, it doesn't. It's simply a statement of fact: \"outbreaks detected.\" No predictions, no speculation, no mention of things getting better or easing up.\n\nTherefore, Q10 is a definitive \"no\". If Q11 were available, I'd proceed there, but I'm only asked to provide the Q10 response.\n\nThe JSON output needs an \"answer\" and \"rationale.\" The answer is \"no.\" The rationale needs to be concise (max 80 tokens).\n\nLet's double-check my logic. Q10 is about speculation and lack of explicit calming. Examples I'm familiar with are things like \"restrictions may be short-lived,\" which this segment certainly isn't.\n\nSo, the JSON response will be:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment describes a current situation ('Outbreaks have been detected') and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.\"\n}\n```\nThat rationale satisfies the requirements, and I'm ready to move on."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any direct quotations or attributed statements from a specific source.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Dominant Framed Quotations**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\" My task is to apply Q11, which looks for a dominant framed quotation. Hmm, well, this seems straightforward. There are no direct quotations here, no phrases in quotation marks, and no attributed statements from a specific source. This means I can confidently answer \"no\" to Q11. Time to move on to the next question in the series, whatever that may be. I'll make sure the JSON output correctly reflects this \"no\" response."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit framing cues (intensifiers, vivid verbs, explicit calming). 'Outbreaks' is a standard term, 'detected' is neutral, and 'in more than a dozen states' is factual reporting of scale. Fits Q12 Neutral definition.", "thoughts": "**Q12 Rule Application: \"Outbreaks Detected in Multiple States\"**\n\nOkay, here's how I'd approach this, considering the task.  I'm being asked to assess the framing of \"Outbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states\" using the Q12 rule. While I know Q12 is the final default, I need to methodically rule out higher-precedence cues first, just to be thorough.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n*   **Q1 (Intensifiers and Risk Adjectives):** No intensifiers or risk adjectives. A quick check.\n*   **Q2 (Vivid Verbs):** \"Detected\" is neutral; it doesn't convey any particular emotion. \"Outbreaks\" is also a standard, descriptive term for a negative event, but not a vivid verb in this context.\n*   **Q3 (Moderate Verb + Scale/Metric):** Hmm, \"detected\" *is* moderate, and we do have a scale: \"more than a dozen states.\" But it's not the classic \"Q3\" pattern where the verb amplifies the *impact* in an alarming way. \"Detected *in* states\" is reporting the spread, the location.  While the context guard mentions that vivid language on *background conditions* is ignored, the spread of the outbreak is the realised impact, and the verb \"detected\" is not vivid.  It's more akin to a factual reporting of the situation.  I'd say this doesn't trigger Q3.\n*   **Q4 (Explicit Calming):** Nothing explicitly calming here.\n*   **Q5 and Q6:** Not applicable at this stage.\n\nSo, where are we? This segment *states a fact*: outbreaks are happening across multiple states.  It's a negative fact, yes, but let's look at the language:\n\n*   \"Outbreaks\" is standard terminology.\n*   \"Detected\" is neutral.\n*   \"More than a dozen states\" is a fact, a measurement of the scale.\n\nApplying the bedrock principle and the symmetry rule, a negative fact presented factually, is neutral. No embellishments, no exaggerations, no attempts to soothe.\n\nQ12 asks if *no* alarmist or reassuring cues remain and the presentation is purely factual.  Bingo.\n\n*   No intensifiers, no vivid verbs, no soothing language.\n*   \"Outbreaks\" is neutral in this context.\n*   \"Detected\" is neutral.\n*   \"In more than a dozen states\" - just facts.\n\nIt aligns with the Q12 table's \"Factual Reporting\" pattern - think \"detected in 3 locations\" - straightforward, neutral.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q12 is \"yes,\" and the frame is **Neutral**.\n\nThe rationale is clear: No explicit framing cues. The situation is a fact reported neutrally without rhetorical additions."}
