{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking for a comparison but contains no intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Comparative Query**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" and asked to analyze it using that 12-step decision tree. My first step, Q1, is pretty straightforward: does the phrase contain an intensifier or a comparative adjective directly modifying a risk adjective?  Let's break it down:\n\n*   Intensifiers? Nope. No \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or anything like that.\n*   Comparative adjectives?  No \"more,\" \"less,\" \"worse,\" etc.\n*   Risk adjectives?  I see none of those either – no \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" or anything implying a risk level is being described.\n\nThis is a pretty simple comparative question, but it lacks the specific linguistic elements that Q1 is looking for. So, the answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" Now, on to the next question in the decision tree... let's see where this analysis takes me."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and contains no high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Evaluation: A Straightforward Comparison**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I've got this text segment, and I need to run it through the Q2 filter from our decision tree. My goal is to determine if this segment uses any alarmist language. Essentially, I'm looking for anything that screams \"hyperbole\" or \"exaggeration.\"\n\nSpecifically, I'm checking for four things: high-potency verbs like \"ravaged\" or \"devastated,\" potent metaphors such as \"ticking time bomb,\" superlative + negative nouns like \"worst crisis,\" and the phrase \"on high alert\" (especially when used in conjunction with a clear threat).\n\nThe segment itself is a simple question: \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" Now, this is a perfectly valid and important question, especially in my field. However, it's pretty clear that it doesn't utilize any of those telltale signs of alarmism. It doesn't employ vivid, impactful verbs, metaphorical language, or any superlative/negative noun combinations, and certainly not the phrase \"on high alert.\"\n\nSo, after a good look, my conclusion is that the answer to Q2 is unequivocally \"no.\" It's a straightforward question, seeking a comparison – nothing more, nothing less."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and does not contain any moderate verbs paired with scale/impact information.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Alarmist Framing: The Q3 Test**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the task of assessing this text snippet against the Q3 criterion of the decision tree. It's pretty straightforward, actually. The core of Q3 is about identifying that Alarmist framing, and it hinges on the presence of two key things: a 'moderate verb' from our approved list or regex – verbs that suggest impact – and then, importantly, that the verb must be *directly paired* with specific information indicating significant scale or impact. Things like 'millions affected,' 'record losses,' 'overwhelming systems' – you know the drill. It's about looking for the 'sensationalist' framing.\n\nSo, let's look at the segment: \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\"\n\nImmediately, my expert eye scans for those trigger verbs. There aren't any. \"Compare\" is the main verb here, and it's definitely not on the list. We're looking for something like \"hit,\" \"swept,\" \"surged,\" etc. – verbs that communicate an *actual* impact. This is just a question about comparing things.\n\nBeyond the missing verbs, and this is crucial, there's no mention of scale or impact either. No numbers, no dramatic descriptions of consequences. Just a question. So, the criteria for Q3 aren't met. It's a clear \"no\" on this one. My rationale, when I explain this, will have to specifically focus on the absence of both the necessary verbs and the required scale/impact information to justify this answer."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The question 'How do these outbreaks compare...' is a neutral, information-seeking question, not a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing a Segment for Rhetorical Loading**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" and I need to evaluate it against Q4, which focuses on identifying loaded rhetorical questions that subtly imply a need for alarm. My expert intuition tells me this should be a straightforward task, but let's break it down methodically.\n\nFirst, I define the segment: \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\". Then, I understand the criteria of Q4: it's looking for questions *designed* to instill fear or urgency, not just neutral inquiries.\n\nComparing the segment to the Q4 criteria, this question, \"How do these outbreaks compare...\", feels inherently factual. It's seeking comparative data, the kind of information that I, as an expert in [user's field], would naturally require. There's no loaded language here, no suggestion of an impending crisis or a need for immediate action. It's simply a quest for understanding the context.\n\nI then check against the examples provided in the Q4 guidelines. They contrast neutral questions (\"What are the safety protocols?\") with alarmist ones (\"Should consumers be worried...?\"). The segment aligns with the information-seeking pattern of the neutral example and diverges completely from the subtle scare tactics of the loaded one.\n\nUltimately, based on this evaluation, it's clear: the question is not loaded. It’s a neutral request for information. Therefore, the answer to Q4 is, quite definitively, \"no.\""}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking for a comparison and contains no explicit calming language or cues about current safety or control.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm taking a look at this text snippet, and the question is whether it passes the Q5 test from that 12-step decision tree we use. That means I'm specifically hunting for any explicit reassurance - statements that signal safety, control, or reduced risk *right now*.\n\nThe segment in question is \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\". Hmm. It's a question, a comparison question at that. It doesn't contain any of the keywords or phrases I'm looking for - nothing about feeling safe, in control, or that the risk is demonstrably lower. I'm not seeing any positive framing or amplification either.\n\nGiven the absence of any reassuring language, the answer to Q5 is definitely \"no\". The text doesn't explicitly communicate any sense of immediate safety, minimized risk, or present control. It's just a query for comparative information."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and contains no minimiser or scale contrast cues.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment in Relation to Decision Tree Q6**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to apply Decision Tree Q6 to the text segment: \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\". My task is to determine if this segment employs a \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" strategy for reassurance, as defined in the context of the overall analysis.\n\nLet's break this down. Q6 essentially wants me to confirm three things: does the segment contain a minimizer (like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"few\"), a scale contrast (something like \"nationwide\" or \"among X\"), and crucially, do these elements work *together* to downplay the significance of the information for a reassuring effect?\n\nLooking at \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\", I see no minimizers whatsoever. It's a straightforward comparative question. Likewise, there's no explicit or implied scale contrast here. There's no framing, like \"only a few outbreaks,\" or \"compared to previous nationwide concerns.\" \n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the segment does *not* utilize this specific linguistic strategy. It doesn't meet any of the three criteria, so there's no way it's employing \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" for reassurance. I can confidently answer \"no\" to Q6. According to the instructions, that leads me to the next decision point (Q7), but since this is only Q6, I'll stop here."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and does not contain any statement of fact, let alone a bare negation.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Segment Against Q7**\n\nOkay, I need to analyze the phrase \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" against Q7, which focuses on identifying bare negations without mitigating language. First, I break down the segment itself. It's a question, a comparative one at that. There's no statement being made, just a request for analysis.\n\nNow, let's consider Q7 directly. This question is looking for negations, statements that explicitly rule out a risk or problem. Think \"not a problem,\" \"no cases,\" \"doesn't pose a risk\" – those are the types of phrases Q7 is concerned with. The segment doesn't contain anything like that. It's asking for a comparison, not denying any risk.\n\nTherefore, applying the Q7 criteria, there's absolutely no evidence of a bare negation in that segment. The answer is definitively \"no.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment 'How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?' does not contain any statement of fact, let alone a negation. Q7 looks for explicit negations of risk or problem, which are absent.\"\n}\n```"}

Let me break this down logically.\n\nFirst, I analyze the segment itself. It's a question, a comparative one at that, essentially probing for similarities and differences between current outbreaks and those in the past. It's about historical context, not about present capabilities or future plans.\n\nNext, I have to determine if this segment aligns with what Q8 is looking for. This is where I have to be particularly precise. Q8 is concerned with active statements about capability, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or implemented safeguards. Does this phrase mention anything like that? No. It doesn't reference officials *working*, *vaccines*, *systems*, *plans*, *protocols*, *measures*, *safeguards*, *capabilities*, *preparedness*, *development*, *implementation*, *containment*, or even future possibilities. It is solely concerned with a comparison.\n\nTherefore, because this comparative question doesn't fit the criteria of Q8, the answer has to be \"no\". And according to my instructions, since the answer is \"no,\" I don't need to produce any more output and can simply proceed to the next stage in the process. I am now prepared to provide the JSON response for Q8."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question comparing outbreaks, not reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Segment's Applicability to Q9**\n\nAlright, so the task at hand is to analyze \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" and determine if it falls under the purview of Q9. My expertise tells me Q9 specifically targets segments that report prices, economic data, or numerical metrics. These reports typically employ standard descriptive verbs, and potentially neutral adverbs, to present factual data. Notably, Q9 explicitly *excludes* segments employing vivid or potent verbs, risk adjectives, or other explicit framing that go beyond a simple presentation of numerical information.\n\nNow, consider the segment: \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" My immediate assessment is that this is a comparison question. It's seeking to contrast the scale or nature of different outbreaks, not to explicitly report prices, economic data, or numerical metrics in the style Q9 describes. I see no standard descriptive verbs presenting factual data in the way Q9 is designed to find. This isn't about reporting that something 'rose' or 'declined'; it's about making a relative comparison.\n\nBased on this analysis, the segment clearly does *not* satisfy the criteria outlined in Q9. Therefore, my answer to this evaluation must be a definitive \"no\"."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking for a comparison of current outbreaks to previous ones; it does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating a Segment Against Decision Tree Q10**\n\nOkay, so I've got this segment, \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\", and I need to run it against Q10 of the decision tree. As an expert in this, I know Q10 is all about sniffing out speculation about future improvements *without* any calming language about the present.\n\nSo, I analyze the segment. It's a question, a direct request for a comparison between current and past outbreaks. It's not *predicting* anything, not *hoping* for anything. It's simply seeking information and context by looking at historical data. No talk of future relief here, no hints of an optimistic outlook that's ungrounded. It's purely factual.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q10 has to be a resounding \"no.\" This segment doesn't touch on potential future improvement in a way that aligns with the criteria of Q10."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question posed by the author and does not contain a directly quoted source with explicit framing.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Q11 Applicability**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" My task is to determine if this aligns with Question 11 of the decision tree. That question, as I recall, looks for a dominant alarmist or reassuring frame *from a directly quoted source*.\n\nFirst, I need to check for a directly quoted source. This is a simple question posed by the *author*, not something attributed to a specific source. No dice there.\n\nNext, I'm checking for any explicit framing language, alarmist or reassuring, within a quote. Again, nothing. There's no cited source, and no explicit framing, just a general question about comparison.\n\nTherefore, Q11 *definitely* doesn't apply here. The answer is a clear \"no\". Let me format that in JSON, complete with the necessary rationale."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment is a neutral, factual question asking for a comparison, with no explicit framing cues.", "thoughts": "**Final Assessment: Neutral Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the very end of this decision tree, Q12. The user's prompt wants me to analyze the framing of \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" and ultimately arrive at a determination. After going through the previous steps, I have to make a final call if there are any *missed* explicit cues.\n\nLooking at it closely, there's nothing jumping out at me. It's a straight-up question, seeking a factual comparison. No alarmist language, no vivid descriptions of disaster, no exaggerations. The word \"outbreaks\" is the only potentially negative term, but it's used descriptively, not to evoke fear. I'm seeing a neutral inquiry, seeking a comparative answer.\n\nThe presentation itself is factual. The user will be looking for facts and a neutral answer. Based on the rules and the default-to-neutral guideline, I'm confident in saying the frame is **Neutral**. Therefore, my answer to Q12 will be \"yes,\" and my rationale will be that the segment lacks any explicit framing cues and is, at its core, a factual question."}
