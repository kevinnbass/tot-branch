{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis: \"The virus is so contagious...\"**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this. The prompt wants me to analyze \"The virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\" I need to apply Q1 from the decision tree. Q1 asks if there's an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nI see \"so contagious.\"  \"So\" is clearly an intensifier, and \"contagious\" is a risk-adjective. It's right there on the list!  And \"so\" directly modifies \"contagious\".  That matches the pattern: \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj.\"  That puts it squarely in the \"Alarmist\" category based on the Q1 Pattern Recognition Table, the \"RULE 1 QUICK MEMORY HOOK,\" and the \"Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria.\"\n\nTherefore, Q1 is a \"yes.\"  According to the Precedence Ladder, that means the frame is Alarmist. I stop here and output the JSON. The decisive cue is \"so contagious.\"\n\nI ran through the self-audit, and everything checks out.  Q1 = Yes, decisive cue quoted, not neutrally stated, and all the rest.  Ready to output the JSON."}
