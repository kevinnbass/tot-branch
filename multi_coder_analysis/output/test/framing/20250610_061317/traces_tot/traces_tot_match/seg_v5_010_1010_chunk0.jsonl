{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'particularly' modifies the risk-adjective 'brutal'.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. I'm being asked to apply the first question (Q1) of the decision tree to this text snippet: \"The winter of 2020 was particularly brutal, causing a shortage in the domestic supply of poultry livestock. This circumstantial scarcity [shortage], combined with the highest levels of inflation in 40 years, has resulted in record-high chicken prices, with chicken meat already selling for an average of $1.62 per pound in January (before the detection of the current outbreak [of H5N1]).\"\n\nThe core of Q1 is to identify if an intensifier or comparative adjective is *directly* modifying a risk adjective.  Essentially, I'm looking for the pattern: `(intensifier/comparative) + (risk-adjective)`.  The provided lists of risk adjectives (deadly, lethal, dangerous, severe, catastrophic, brutal, contagious, virulent, destructive) and intensifiers/comparatives (so, very, extremely, highly, particularly, frighteningly, more, less, deadlier, safer, higher, lower) are my tools here.\n\nScanning the text, I immediately see it. The phrase \"particularly brutal\" jumps out.  \"Particularly\" is clearly an intensifier, and \"brutal\" is *definitely* on the risk-adjective list. Boom! That's the pattern. Because the rule states that the presence of this pattern leads to a \"yes\" answer to Q1, and automatically categorizes the frame as Alarmist, my response is simple."}
