{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: A Clear 'No'**\n\nOkay, I've got it. The user wants me to run this text segment through Q1 of the decision tree. Looking at \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky,\" I see no sign of those intensifiers or comparatives modifying a risk adjective. It's all neutral language. No \"so deadly\" or \"more severe\" here. The answer to Q1 is a firm \"no.\" My rationale will be concise: No intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifies a risk-adjective, failing the pattern."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a lack of disclosure, but does not use any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases to frame the situation alarmingly.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm analyzing this segment: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\" The task is to determine if it alarmingly frames the situation, specifically based on Q2 of the 12-step decision tree. This means I'm looking for certain linguistic cues: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative noun combinations, or critical alert phrases.\n\nFirst, I scanned the text for those high-potency verbs: terms like \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" \"crashed,\" etc. The verb here is \"would not disclose,\" which is a simple statement of fact.  It's not a verb designed to evoke strong emotion or a sense of urgency.\n\nNext, I looked for potent metaphors, those vivid comparisons that paint a dramatic picture.  There's no \"ticking time-bomb\" or \"nightmare scenario\" here. Nothing metaphorical.\n\nThen, I checked for superlative + negative noun pairings, like \"worst crisis\" or \"record outbreak.\"  There's nothing of the sort.\n\nFinally, I scanned for critical alert phrases, specifically \"on high alert\" (which requires a nearby threat word).  Again, no match.\n\nIn short, the segment simply reports a lack of disclosure. It's a factual statement, not a loaded one.  There's no use of alarming language, and therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria of Q2. My answer is \"no.\" This is because the segment does not contain any of the linguistic cues outlined in Q2.\n\nThe JSON response for Q2 would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative noun combinations, or critical alert phrases as defined in Q2. It is a factual statement about a lack of disclosure, not a description of an event using alarming language.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a moderate verb from the approved list paired with explicit scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment for Framing Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I've been given the text segment \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" to evaluate against Q3 of the framing analysis decision tree. My task is to determine if this segment triggers an \"Alarmist\" frame. I know from my experience that Q3 is looking for a specific pattern: \"moderate verbs\" that are paired with information indicating a \"significant scale or impact.\"\n\nI need to meticulously check the segment against the criteria I've defined. First, I have to look for verbs on my approved list/regex. These verbs are the ones that suggest heightened concern or impact: verbs like *hit*, *swept*, *surged*, *soared*, *plunged*, *plummeted*, *prompted*, *feared*, *fearing*, and *culled* (but not if it's followed by \"flock,\" \"flocks,\" \"birds,\" or \"poultry\"). I also have to ensure those verbs describe actualized impact, not just potential or hypothetical impact. Finally, if I do find an appropriate verb, it *must* be connected to information that details significant scale or impact—something like \"millions culled,\" \"record losses,\" or \"overwhelming systems.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the segment: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\" The verbs here are \"would not disclose.\" Are these verbs on my list? No. Do they represent realized impact? No, they merely describe a failure to act, not a significant event. There is no information about scale or impact anywhere in the segment.\n\nTherefore, the segment clearly *doesn't* satisfy the requirements of Q3. My answer is \"no\". The rationale is based on the absence of a moderate verb from the approved list and the lack of corresponding scale/impact information."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement, not a question, and therefore cannot be a loaded rhetorical question.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment in Relation to Q4**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess this segment, \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky,\" against Q4. Q4 specifically targets loaded rhetorical questions that are designed to instill alarm or fear. I'm well-versed in spotting rhetorical devices, and I understand the subtle cues that signal an attempt to manipulate the audience.\n\nFirst, I examined the segment itself. It's a straightforward statement of fact: Tyson Foods isn't revealing information. It's not a question; it's not designed to invite an answer.  Then I revisited Q4, comparing the provided examples of loaded questions to the segment. Loaded questions, as Q4 describes them, are crafted to evoke a specific emotional response – fear, worry, or a sense of impending danger. They often imply a negative situation without directly stating it.\n\nThis segment simply doesn't fit that mold. It's a declarative sentence, objectively reporting a situation.  It lacks the framing, the implied concerns, or the urgent tone that characterizes a loaded rhetorical question. Given that, the answer to Q4 is clearly \"no.\" Because it's \"no,\" I'll move on to the next question, which I know is the appropriate procedure for a \"no\" response to this specific query."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text reports a lack of disclosure and contains no explicit calming language or cues about safety or control.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Decision Tree Question Q5**\n\nOkay, I'm looking at this text segment provided and need to assess it against Question Q5 of the decision tree. Q5 is specifically looking for an explicit calming cue, something that offers reassurance. I've got to check whether the text \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\" contains any such reassurance.\n\nImmediately, I see that this sentence is about *lack* of disclosure. It's reporting a withholding of information, not providing any sense of safety or control. There's nothing here that directly minimizes the present risk or states that things are secure. I'm not seeing any phrases like \"don't worry,\" \"no cause for alarm,\" \"public can rest easy,\" \"fully under control,\" or any of the patterns I know to look for based on my expertise in this decision-making process.\n\nGiven the absence of any reassuring language or explicitly calming cues, I have to conclude that the answer to Q5 is definitely \"no.\" My JSON output will, of course, reflect this, and I'll include a quick note stating that the text segment lacks the necessary explicit calming cues for reassurance."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment 'Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky' contains no minimiser or scale contrast cues required for Q6.", "thoughts": "**Q6 Decision Evaluation: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\"**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The task is straightforward: check if this text chunk hits the mark for Q6 of the decision tree. Q6, as we know, is all about spotting that 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' combo designed for reassurance.\n\nSo, let's break down \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\" First, a minimiser – anything like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely\" is a clear flag. Nope, nothing there. Secondly, we're looking for that contrasting scale – something to highlight the magnitude. Again, not present. This segment is purely factual: Tyson isn't sharing data.\n\nWithout those crucial elements – the minimiser and the contrasting scale – we can't get that reassuring effect Q6 seeks. This is simply a statement of non-disclosure, not a carefully crafted reassurance strategy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"no\". The text doesn't align with the Q6 criteria."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains a negation ('would not disclose') but it is not a 'bare negation' as defined by Q7, which relates to denying or downplaying risks, problems, evidence, or capabilities. This statement is about a company's action regarding information disclosure.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\" My task is to assess it against Question Q7, which deals with \"bare negations\" – those instances where information subtly downplays a risk or problem.\n\nFirst, I identified the negation: \"would not disclose.\" Clearly, there's a negative element here. Now, I need to see if this fits Q7's definition. Remember, Q7 is specifically concerned with negations that deny or downplay a risk or problem. It offers examples like \"not expected to cause problems,\" \"unlikely to affect X,\" or \"tests were negative.\"\n\nI'm seeing a disconnect here. \"Would not disclose\" is about *information*, about a decision *not* to release data. It's not directly addressing a risk or problem. It's not a denial of a negative event, nor is it downplaying a potential issue. It's a statement about a company's actions, specifically their disclosure practices, which is different.\n\nThinking through the Q7 examples... they all relate to the *absence* or *unlikelihood* of something bad. My segment is about the absence of information. The phrase \"would not disclose\" doesn't fit into the categories of expectation, evidence, risk, or capability negation the examples illustrate. It's about a decision, not a risk.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that while the segment contains a negation, it isn't a \"bare negation\" as Q7 defines it. Q7 doesn't apply here. I'll be answering \"no\" to this question and then move on to Q8, or whatever is next, as the instructions state."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a lack of disclosure, not capabilities, preparedness, safeguards, or future possibilities.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to analyze the text, \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky,\" against Q8 of the decision tree. Q8 is looking for descriptions of capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, *without* linking them to current calm, safety, or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is, this doesn't seem to fit. It's simply stating a refusal to disclose information, not anything about capabilities, preparedness, or future possibilities. Let me break it down: does it describe capabilities? No. Preparedness? No. Hopeful possibilities? No. Safeguards? No. It's just a statement of non-disclosure.\n\nI've got to be sure, though. I'm going through the list of things Q8 *is* looking for – specific phrases or concepts – and the segment doesn't contain anything like \"vaccine can be made,\" \"officials are working,\" or \"systems are in place.\" It's not about an action taken or a capability. It's about withheld information.\n\nThe prompt requires a JSON response. My answer to Q8 is definitively \"no.\" The rationale needs to be concise and accurate. It can't be more than 80 tokens, and since the answer is \"no,\" there's no need to quote a specific cue.\n\nMy conclusion? The segment is about a lack of disclosure, not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards. So, the final JSON output will be: `{\"answer\":\"no\", \"rationale\":\"The segment describes a lack of disclosure, not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.\"}`. That should be good to go."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a lack of disclosure about a metric, not the metric itself using standard economic reporting language.", "thoughts": "**Q9 Analysis of \"Tyson Foods Would Not Disclose\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this snippet, \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky,\" and the task is to see if it aligns with Q9. Q9, as we know, focuses on whether a piece is *primarily* reporting prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics, using pretty straightforward language – neutral verbs and adverbs, nothing too flashy or alarmist.\n\nMy first thought is, yes, \"size of the flock\" *is* a numerical metric. But the key here is the *emphasis*. The segment isn't really reporting the size of the flock itself; it's reporting *Tyson's refusal to reveal* that information. The wording, \"would not disclose,\" is perfectly standard English, not some hyped-up economic verb. There are no prices, no economic data points being thrown around, and certainly no risk adjectives or framing language that would trip the Q9 alarm bells.\n\nQ9's all about how *metrics* are reported. This segment is really more about *the absence* of metric reporting. So, given that nuance, I'm going to have to say \"no\" to Q9. It's not the same thing."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a fact about non-disclosure and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Q10 Evaluation: A Factual Statement, Not Speculation**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\" The task is to determine if this piece *speculates* about future relief or improvement, without any calming cues about the present.\n\nMy initial thought is that this is a statement of fact. It's reporting a past action: Tyson Foods' refusal to disclose information. There's nothing in here about *future* conditions getting better, easing up, or any kind of hopeful predictions. I'm not seeing any language that suggests speculation.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q10 is a resounding \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the segment reports a past action of non-disclosure; it's a factual statement, not a speculative one about the future.\n\nThis means I'd be ready to provide the necessary JSON response with `answer: \"no\"` and a rationale that reflects this analysis. I'm confident in this evaluation."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports an action by Tyson Foods but does not contain a direct quote or attributed statement with explicit framing language.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Segment Regarding Tyson Foods**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, and the task is to see if it triggers Question 11 of that decision tree. That question, as I recall, is about a directly quoted source providing a dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame.\n\nFirst, I quickly scan the text, and there are no direct quotes. Simple enough.  No quotation marks anywhere. So, that's step one down.\n\nNext, I need to see if there's an attributed statement *that sounds like a quote*, even if it's not explicitly formatted as one. We have \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\"  It *is* attributed to Tyson Foods, but it's not a quote of their *words*. It's a statement about their *actions*. \"Would not disclose\" is a neutral statement of fact, a report of their behavior. It's not the kind of framing language I'm looking for - nothing alarming or reassuring in *that* statement.\n\nThe crucial part is the *frame*. Is there an Alarmist tone? Does it imply something concerning?  Is it trying to calm us down? No. It's simply a factual report. \"Would not disclose\" doesn't provide a *frame*. It's just a reporting of a lack of information.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q11 is a clear \"no.\"  I'll need to indicate that in my JSON response, along with the rationale I just went through.  I'm ready to move on to the next question, although I haven't been prompted for it yet. That's the logical next step."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit framing cues; segment reports a factual lack of disclosure neutrally.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text for Framing Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the final stage, Q12, the \"default to neutral\" check.  The task is to determine if there's any remaining evidence of alarmist or reassuring language in the text: \"Tyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\"\n\nLet's run through the steps.  There's no sign of the usual suspects: no *intensifiers* with *risk adjectives* (Q1), no *vivid verbs* depicting impact (Q2), no *moderate verbs* amplifying scale (Q3), and definitely no *explicit calming* (Q4).  \n\nWait a minute, I do see something. The phrase \"would not disclose\" *could* be considered a *bare negation* of an action – in this case, disclosing information (Q5).  But by the rules, a *bare negation* defaults to Neutral.  I've already moved past the more impactful rules, and the language is, at its core, purely factual. There's no loaded rhetoric, metaphors, exaggeration, or direct emotional appeals to the audience. It simply reports a *lack* of disclosure.\n\nIn short, there's no framing here, positive or negative. It's a straight-up statement of fact, which is the very definition of neutral reporting. And since I'm at Q12, which comes after all the other checks, and Q5 would have already led to neutral, reaching Q12 confirms that there are no remaining cues. Thus, my answer to Q12 is a resounding \"yes.\"  The rationale is straightforward: the text presents a neutral statement of fact, without employing any explicit alarmist or reassuring framing techniques."}
