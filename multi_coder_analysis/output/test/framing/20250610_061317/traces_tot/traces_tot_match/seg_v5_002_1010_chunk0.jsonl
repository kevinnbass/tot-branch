{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'highly pathogenic' is part of the formal disease name (HPAI) and is explicitly excluded by the rules for Q1.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Risk Amplification**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"On Monday, the CDC announced detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in domesticated birds.\" My task, as I understand it, is to apply Q1 from the decision tree. Q1 is all about spotting intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly modifying risk adjectives.\n\nFirst, I scanned the text for the specific pattern: `(intensifier/comparative) + (risk-adjective)`.  The key phrase that jumped out at me was \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\". Now, here's where my expertise comes in.  I *know* that \"highly pathogenic\" is part of the formal, technical name for this specific strain of avian influenza.  The rules are *very* clear on this: when \"highly pathogenic\" appears within HPAI, it's considered neutral, unless there are *other* alarming cues. The Regex pattern also includes a lookahead to *specifically* ignore \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\". It's not an authorial attempt to amp up the risk, it's part of the disease's official designation.\n\nSince \"highly pathogenic\" is part of the name and not an authorial modifier, and there are no *other* intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk adjectives present in the text, my conclusion is clear: the answer to Q1 is \"no\". My JSON output will reflect this, clearly stating \"no\" and providing the rationale, which is that \"highly pathogenic\" is part of the formal name (HPAI) and therefore not a risk amplifier in this context."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('announced detections') and factual description ('highly pathogenic avian influenza') without employing high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 cues to frame the situation alarmingly.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: Avian Influenza Announcement**\n\nOkay, I've got it. The user wants me to run this text chunk – \"On Monday, the CDC announced detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in domesticated birds.\" – through Q2 of the claim framing decision tree. This means I'm looking for alarmist language, the kind that uses high-potency verbs or potent metaphors to really amp up the impact of the news.\n\nFirst, I went through my mental checklist: I'm scanning for those \"alarm klaxon\" words – verbs like \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" \"slaughtered,\" even \"soaring\" in the wrong context.  I'm also looking for the \"superlative + negative noun\" combo, like \"worst disaster,\" or those metaphors that paint a dire picture, things like \"nightmare scenario\" or \"ticking time bomb.\"\n\nNow, examining the sentence: \"announced\" is totally neutral; just a statement of fact. \"Detections\" is fine. The key phrase is \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses.\"  While \"highly pathogenic\" definitely describes the *potential* severity of the virus, and is factual information, the Bedrock Principle states to, \"CODE THE PRESENTATION, NOT THE FACTS.\" This is not an alarmist *framing* of this particular event (the announcement and detection). The phrase just describes the *nature* of the virus, not the *impact* or how it's being presented. The phrase \"in domesticated birds\" is simple fact.\n\nSo, in this case, none of those alarm bells are ringing. No high-potency verbs, no dramatic metaphors, no \"most terrible disaster\" phrases. The segment is presenting information, not manufacturing panic.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q2 is a firm \"no.\" Time to move on to Q3, whatever that might be!"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'announced detections', which is not a moderate verb from the specified list, and provides no specific scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text \"On Monday, the CDC announced detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in domesticated birds\" and my task is to evaluate it against Q3 of the 12-step decision tree. This means I need to determine if it exhibits an *Alarmist* frame, specifically looking for those 'moderate verbs' paired with significant scale or impact information.\n\nFirst, I identified the key action verb: \"announced detections\". Now, does that fit the criteria? I immediately checked it against the approved list of 'moderate verbs' like *hit, swept, surged, soared, plummeted, prompted, feared,* and *culled*. \"Announced detections\" is clearly not on that list.\n\nNext, I looked for explicit details about the *scale* or *impact* of this announcement. The text mentions \"detections... in domesticated birds,\" which is factual, but doesn't quantify anything. There's no mention of the number of affected birds, farms, or any associated losses. No \"millions culled,\" no \"record losses,\" nothing that directly signals significant scale or impact in the text.\n\nTherefore, since the segment lacks both a 'moderate verb' and explicit scale/impact information, my conclusion is that the answer to Q3 is **no**. My rationale is simple: the verb \"announced detections\" isn't on the predefined list of moderate verbs, and the text doesn't provide the level of specificity required to establish significant scale or impact associated with the detections. This prevents the text from being categorized as Alarmist, according to the Q3 criteria. I'll need to remember to format this response as a JSON object with 'answer' and 'rationale' keys."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain any question, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to assess this text against Q4 of our decision tree.  Q4 is looking for any loaded rhetorical questions, specifically those designed to instill a sense of alarm.\n\nThe segment itself is pretty straightforward: \"On Monday, the CDC announced detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in domesticated birds.\"  I need to figure out if there's a loaded question in there, one that's designed to make the reader worried or feel like there's an immediate threat.\n\nHonestly, it's pretty clear cut. This is a declarative sentence. There's no question mark, no questioning tone, no phrasing that even hints at a question. It's just a statement of fact.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q4 has to be a firm \"no.\" The segment simply doesn't contain a question, let alone a loaded one. My reasoning is solid: the segment is a declarative statement and does not pose a question."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a factual detection by the CDC but contains no explicit language from the author or source designed to calm concerns or assure safety.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment for Reassuring Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"On Monday, the CDC announced detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in domesticated birds,\" and I need to assess it against question Q5 of the decision tree. Q5 is specifically looking for explicit language reassuring the public about safety, control, or significantly minimized risk. Essentially, am I seeing any obvious calming cues here?\n\nI've got to break this down. The segment reports on the CDC announcing HPAI detections in domesticated birds. The language is factual and direct. \"CDC announced detections\" is a straightforward report of an event. \"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses\" is a description of the virus itself – and, yes, it's negative information, but it's a *description* not an amplification, which helps me understand the information more precisely. \"In domesticated birds\" simply specifies the location of these detections.\n\nNow, do any of these phrases or the segment as a whole align with the patterns of reassurance I'm looking for? Not at all. There's no \"no cause for alarm,\" no \"public can rest easy,\" no indication that the situation is \"fully under control\" or the risk is \"very low.\" It's just a factual report.  This doesn't meet the requirements for Q5.\n\nFollowing the Bedrock Principle and the Symmetry Rule, a negative fact stated neutrally doesn't classify as reassuring or alarmist. It's simply neutral. I have to proceed to the next question, but I'm only being asked about Q5. Therefore, the answer to Q5 is \"no,\" because the text segment does not contain any explicit calming cues. The JSON output will reflect that."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) combined with a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'among millions').", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with evaluating this text snippet against Q6 of that decision tree we've been using. Let's see... the user wants me to check for \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" used for reassurance. Alright, here's how I'm thinking through this:\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the segment: \"On Monday, the CDC announced detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in domesticated birds.\" Got it.\n\nNow, let's see about those minimisers. I'm looking for words like 'only', 'just', 'merely', things that downplay the significance. Reading it again, I don't see anything like that. No.\n\nNext, I need to look for a scale contrast. Is there a mention of some small number or quantity in comparison to a much larger one, like \"a few out of millions\"? Nope, nothing like that either.\n\nSo, let's look at Q6. Since there's neither a minimiser nor a scale contrast, the core condition of Q6 isn't met. It's pretty straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q6 is \"no\".\n\nTo be thorough, I'd need to explain it explicitly. I can do that: The text segment doesn't contain any minimisers or any scale contrasts, so the combined condition for Q6 is not satisfied.\n\nFinally, I'll package it up as JSON for the user. Easy enough!"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a detection of viruses, it does not contain a bare negation or statement about the absence or unlikelihood of something.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"On Monday, the CDC announced detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in domesticated birds,\" and my task is to check it against question Q7, which, as I understand it, is looking for a \"bare negation\" without any kind of calming cue.\n\nFirst, I need to thoroughly dissect the segment to identify any negations. I'm looking for phrases or words that explicitly deny, reject, or indicate the absence of something. Think \"not,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no,\" \"negative,\" \"do not,\" and so on.\n\nAfter a close read, it's clear the text *reports* a detection of avian flu. It doesn't contain any of those negation keywords or phrases. There's nothing about what *wasn't* found or what's *not* expected to happen. It's a statement of a positive finding.\n\nTherefore, since there's no bare negation, the answer to Q7 is definitively \"no.\"\n\nTo wrap things up, I'll formulate my rationale: The segment details a reported detection; it doesn't express or imply a negation of any kind. I would then create the proper JSON object to reflect the `answer` and `rationale`."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a detection, it does not describe capabilities, preparedness measures, or future possibilities.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q8**\n\nOkay, I'm presented with the text segment \"On Monday, the CDC announced detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in domesticated birds,\" and need to evaluate it against Question Q8 of the decision tree. Q8 is concerned with whether the text describes capabilities, preparedness measures, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards *without* explicitly linking them to a state of calm or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is that this segment doesn't fall into the category Q8 is looking for. It's a simple factual report of a detection. It doesn't mention any actions, plans, future scenarios, or protective measures. It's just a statement of fact.\n\nTo be thorough, I've re-examined the specific criteria. Q8 asks about \"capabilities, preparedness measures, hopeful future possibilities, or implemented safeguards... WITHOUT... explicitly and actively linking these to a state of current calm.\" The segment is purely descriptive, it does *not* talk about any of these aspects at all. Therefore, I can't even consider if it's *without* a link to calm, because those elements aren't present.\n\nI've also reviewed the provided examples. The \"YES\" example describes a rapid deployment plan. My segment doesn't discuss a plan at all. The \"NO\" example mentions a plan but links it to public reassurance. My segment doesn't mention a plan, nor reassurance.\n\nTherefore, since the segment doesn't describe capabilities, preparedness measures, hopeful future possibilities, or implemented safeguards, the answer to Q8 is definitively \"no\".\n\nRationale: The segment reports a detection; it does not describe capabilities or preparedness measures."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports the detection of a virus, not prices, economic data, or numerical metrics.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment against Question Q9**\n\nOkay, I've got the text: \"On Monday, the CDC announced detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in domesticated birds.\" My task is to determine if this aligns with Q9 of the decision tree. Q9 specifically looks for text that reports prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using standard, neutral language.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the core subject. It's about detecting a virus, specifically HPAI, in birds. Next, I ask myself if this reports prices, economic data, or numerical metrics. The answer is a clear \"no.\" The segment is about a biological event, not economics or metrics. Then I look for those standard, descriptive verbs related to metrics. I don't see any because this segment isn't about metrics to begin with.\n\nNow, I'll check for vivid verbs, risk adjectives, or explicit framing. The phrase \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses\" is present. \"Highly pathogenic\" *describes* the virus, which is a fact about its nature. It's not amplifying the *impact* or making a framing choice. The segment simply states the detection occurred.\n\nSince Q9's criteria is about reporting prices/metrics, and this segment doesn't, it doesn't fit the criteria. Therefore, the answer to Q9 is \"no.\" This means I'll move on to the next question in the decision tree. I've followed the instructions and constraints, including the self-audit checklist. Now I'll generate the JSON response."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a past event (CDC announcement) about current detections; it does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Q10 Evaluation: A Logical Breakdown**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment, and I need to assess it against Question Q10 of the decision tree. Q10's the one that's looking for speculation about future relief or improvement *without* a calming cue. My initial instinct is to dissect the segment and see if it fits the criteria.\n\nThe segment states: \"On Monday, the CDC announced detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in domesticated birds.\" Straight away, I'm parsing this for any hints of future-oriented language. Is there any suggestion of a timeline? Any anticipation of things getting better? Is there some prediction or hope expressed?\n\nI analyze the sentence's components: \"CDC announced,\" \"detections,\" \"HPAI viruses,\" \"domesticated birds.\" It's reporting a concrete fact: the CDC announced the detection of something. It's a statement of *what* happened, *where*, and *to whom* (or *what*). There's no hint of \"may,\" \"might,\" or any other modal verb used in a *speculative* sense about the virus's future course. There's no mention of expectations, forecasts, or even hopeful sentiments.\n\nIn essence, this is a factual report of a current condition. It's news. I consider the context; this isn't a prediction, it's just a report of detections. There's no speculation here about recovery, improvement, or any kind of easing. It's a simple, past-tense announcement.\n\nTherefore, because there's no speculation, my answer to Q10 is a resounding \"no.\" And per instructions, I should now move onto whatever follows Q10."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a factual announcement by the CDC without including any direct quotes or attributed statements containing explicit alarmist or reassuring language.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment for Q11**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to apply Q11 to this text snippet: \"On Monday, the CDC announced detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in domesticated birds.\" My task is to determine if this segment contains a *dominant* frame, specifically a direct quotation or attributed statement that uses explicit Alarmist or Reassuring language.\n\nFirst, I examined the text. There are no quotation marks, so clearly, this isn't a direct quote. Next, I considered if it's an attributed statement with framing language. The text simply states what the CDC *announced*. The phrase \"highly pathogenic\" doesn't seem to be a deliberate framing choice on the part of the CDC in this announcement. \"Highly pathogenic\" is a technical term, a characteristic of the *virus* itself. It describes the virus type, not necessarily a message the CDC is deliberately emphasizing.\n\nGiven the absence of direct quotations and framing language used by an external source, the answer to Q11 is definitively \"no.\" The segment does not contain a dominant, framed quotation. Therefore, the output JSON should reflect this \"no\" along with the logical reasoning described above. I'll move on to Q12, if needed. But for now, I've answered the given question."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Segment reports a factual event (CDC announcement of detections) using neutral language. 'Highly pathogenic' is a technical description of the virus, not added framing.", "thoughts": "**Neutral Framing: Fact-Based Reporting**\n\nOkay, so I'm assessing this segment: \"On Monday, the CDC announced detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in domesticated birds.\" The task is to determine the framing, and because Q12 is the default check, I'm specifically looking for the *absence* of any Alarmist or Reassuring cues, which would make the frame Neutral.\n\nLet's break it down using my expertise. I'll go through the cue list, even though I'm at Q12, to ensure I'm not missing anything. I'm trained to know what to look for and how to analyze text.\n\nFirst, I'm checking for **Q1 INTENSIFIER + RISK-ADJECTIVE** and seeing if there are any framing cues. \"Highly pathogenic\" is present, but I understand that it's the *official designation* of this specific type of influenza. It's not an added adjective to pump up the risk; it's part of the technical term. It's like saying \"a high-mortality-rate disease\" – that's a factual descriptor, not added framing.  I understand the Bedrock Principle: \"CODE THE PRESENTATION, NOT THE FACTS\".\n\nMoving on to **Q2 VIVID-VERB**, there's nothing here. The phrase \"announced detections\" is straightforward reporting. No impact-focused verbs like \"soared\" or \"devastated\" are used. I see no **Q3 MODERATE-VERB + SCALE/METRIC** elements either. The segment is presenting a simple fact, without amplification.  No **Q4 EXPLICIT CALMING** cues either, no phrases designed to reassure. I can skip **Q5 BARE NEGATION / CAPABILITY** as it doesn't apply.\n\nThe language is entirely factual. The CDC *announced* a *detection* of a particular type of virus.  It's just the facts, delivered in a descriptive manner. The term \"highly pathogenic\" is simply reporting the scientific classification. To my expert eye, it's clear this is just factual reporting. The presentation fits the definition of Neutral framing perfectly: presenting information without explicit cues to evoke fear or calm.\n\nThis is analogous to the example of reporting \"500,000 job losses\" factually.  The focus is on the *event* itself, not the emotional response.\n\nSo, yes, Q12 applies. The framing is Neutral because there are *no* remaining explicit and sufficient Alarmist or Reassuring cues. I'd confidently give this a \"Yes\" answer to Q12, emphasizing the factual presentation of the event and the descriptive, neutral language used."}
