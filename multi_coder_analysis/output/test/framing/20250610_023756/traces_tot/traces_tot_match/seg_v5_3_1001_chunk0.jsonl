{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains the risk-adjective 'deadly' but it is not modified by an intensifier or comparative adjective.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I'm examining this text snippet to see if it meets the criteria of Q1 in the decision tree. Q1 is looking specifically for an intensifier or comparative adjective *directly* modifying a risk adjective. The text is \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\"\n\nMy focus is on the word \"deadly.\" It *is* a risk adjective, no doubt. Now, I need to check for an intensifier or comparative *immediately* preceding it. My mind runs through those categories: \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"more,\" \"less,\" etc. But what I see directly before \"deadly\" is \"can be.\" \"Can be\" doesn't fit the mold of an intensifier or comparative at all in this context; it's part of the verb phrase.\n\nThe clarification rule reiterates that \"deadly\" on its own, without direct intensification, is generally considered Neutral unless other alarmist signals exist. Given the structure of the segment and based on my understanding of the decision tree rules and example cases, \"deadly\" by itself doesn't trip Q1. Therefore, my answer to Q1 is \"no.\""}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a factual potential outcome ('can be deadly') but does not use a high-potency verb or potent metaphor to actively frame the situation alarmingly.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Evaluation: A Nuanced Perspective**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this. The task is to determine if the phrase \"can be deadly\" in the provided text triggers a \"yes\" on Q2 of the decision tree, which looks for high-potency verbs or potent metaphors that create an alarming frame.\n\nMy expertise tells me that while \"deadly\" certainly implies a serious outcome, I need to evaluate *how* it's presented. The instruction emphasizes looking for active, framing language – words like \"ravaged\" or metaphors that amplify the threat.\n\nThe word \"deadly\" itself is an adjective, not a verb. It describes a *potential* outcome, not an active process. It's a factual statement about the severity of the avian flu's impact on domestic poultry. While this is important information, the key is the framing. The Bedrock Principle about coding presentation, not facts, is critical here. It's the presentation that matters, and \"can be deadly\" is simply a factually accurate statement.\n\nThe examples in the Q2 pattern recognition table and the detailed rules reinforce this. Verbs like \"ravaged,\" \"soared,\" and \"swept across\" are actively framing the event, conveying a sense of rapid, destructive action. \"Deadly\" doesn't do that. The regex patterns focus on specific verbs and patterns, and \"deadly\" isn't included.\n\nIn my expert opinion, \"deadly\" doesn't meet the criteria for a high-potency verb or potent metaphor as defined by Q2. It's a factual description of a potential outcome, but it doesn't use vivid language or exaggeration to frame the situation alarmingly.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q2 is \"no,\" and I'll proceed to the next stage of the analysis (Q3)."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'can be deadly' which describes a potential outcome, not a moderate verb from the list paired with realised scale/impact.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Decision: Analyzing the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this text segment: \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\" The goal is to determine if it meets the criteria for Q3 of the decision tree. Q3, as I understand it, looks for the presence of a 'moderate verb' coupled with 'significant scale or impact' details.\n\nFirst, I break down the segment. \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds\" is pretty straightforward: it describes a *lack* of impact in one bird group. That's a factual statement; nothing jumping out at me as a Q3 trigger.\n\nNext, I look at the clause: \"it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\" Here's where the nuance comes in. While \"deadly\" certainly implies a severe consequence, it's used as an adjective, not a verb. It describes *potential* impact. Plus, I remember the Q3 rule specifying that the verb must denote a **realized** impact, not just potential. The listed moderate verbs - *hit, swept, surged, soared, plunged, plummeted, prompted, culled* - are very specific actions conveying a definitive change. The verb here, \"be deadly\", doesn't fit that profile.\n\nSo, summing up, this segment doesn't contain a Q3-compliant moderate verb alongside the critical 'significant scale or impact' information, despite the mention of a potential severe outcome. The answer to Q3 is definitely \"no\". I should proceed to Q4, but since the prompt only requires the Q3 answer, I will stop here."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no questions, rhetorical or otherwise. It is a declarative statement.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to assess this text snippet against the criteria defined in Q4 of our decision tree. Specifically, the task is to determine if the segment contains a loaded rhetorical question designed to instill alarm.\n\nThe segment itself is: \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\"\n\nRight off the bat, it's clear this isn't a question at all. It's a straightforward declarative statement presenting two facts related to avian flu's impact on different bird populations. The first fact is relatively neutral – it's just stating the typical behavior of the virus in wild birds. The second fact, while potentially alarming (the lethality in domestic poultry), is presented in a neutral, factual manner. There's no attempt to frame this as a shocking revelation or to induce an emotional response through questioning.\n\nTherefore, since there are no questions present in the segment, let alone loaded rhetorical ones, the answer to Q4 is unequivocally \"no.\" I'll construct the response in the required JSON format, clearly articulating the rationale based on the absence of any questioning within the text."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports factual information about the effects of avian flu on different bird populations but lacks explicit calming language or assurances of current safety or control.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Explicit Calming Cues: A Clinical Examination**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with this text snippet: \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\" My task is to evaluate this, in the context of the decision tree's Q5. That means I need to see if this passage employs any explicit calming cues that directly reassure us about safety, control, or minimized present risk.\n\nI broke it down. \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds...\"  This part just states a fact about wild birds. No soothing language here, no attempt to ease anxieties. It's a straight-up epidemiological observation.\n\nThen we have, \"...but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\" Again, a straightforward statement of potential risk *for* a specific group. It doesn't tell *me* I'm safe, or that authorities are in command, or that the threat is essentially over.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about the typical calming phrases I'm trained to spot – the ones Q5 specifically points out. \"No cause for alarm,\" \"Rest easy,\" \"Fully under control,\" the \"risk is very low\" type of phrases.  I see none of those.  There's no attempt to put the reader's mind at ease, just factual reporting.\n\nSo, summing it up, the text presents information about the effects of avian flu in two bird populations. It's informative, but not overtly reassuring. It doesn't use the explicit calming language that Q5 is looking for. The answer is a clear \"no.\""}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes different impacts on wild birds and domestic poultry but does not use a minimiser with scale contrast.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Minimiser + Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with checking this text segment against Q6 of the decision tree, which is looking for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern used to offer reassurance.  The segment is: \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds, but it [avian flu] can be deadly in domestic poultry.\"\n\nMy expertise tells me this requires a specific combination: a minimiser like \"only\" or \"just\" *and* a clear scale contrast, something like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions.\"  I have to find both components.\n\nLooking at the text, the first part, \"usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds,\" suggests a low-risk situation for those birds. The second part, \"can be deadly in domestic poultry,\" highlights a high-risk scenario for domestic birds.  That's a contrast, right there.\n\nHowever, I'm not seeing any of the tell-tale minimisers. No \"only,\" no \"just,\" nothing like that.  Also, there's no explicit scale contrast - no mention of \"out of how many\" or \"among what group.\"\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding of this pattern, I must answer \"no\" to Q6.  The specific combination of a minimiser and an explicit scale contrast is absent from this segment."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'does not cause any symptoms' is a bare negation without an explicit calming cue.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to assess it against Q7, which wants to know if there's a \"bare negation\" without a calming cue. My initial read-through suggests this might be the case, but let's break it down.\n\nThe segment says, \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms in wild birds...\" Right there, \"does not cause any symptoms\" jumps out. That's a clear negation, a direct denial of something negative. It's akin to the examples we're trained to recognize: \"not expected to cause problems,\" \"unlikely to affect X,\" etc. It's essentially stating a lack of a negative outcome.\n\nNow, the crucial part is the lack of a calming cue. Does the text immediately follow this negation with something reassuring, something to downplay the potential negative? Nope. Instead, it continues with \"but it can be deadly in domestic poultry.\" That's not calming at all; it introduces another negative fact, contradicting any potential calming effect.\n\nSo, it's a bare negation. \"Does not cause any symptoms\" fits the definition, and there's no follow-up that tries to mitigate the negativity. Therefore, I'm confident in a \"yes\" answer to Q7. The rationale should definitely highlight that decisive phrase: \"**does not cause any symptoms.**\" That's the crux of the bare negation in this case."}
