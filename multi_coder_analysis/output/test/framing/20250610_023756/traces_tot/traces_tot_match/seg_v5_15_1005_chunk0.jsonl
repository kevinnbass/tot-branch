{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the comparative adjective 'more' modifying the risk-adjective 'deadly'.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and I need to determine if it triggers the \"Alarmist\" frame, specifically by looking at Q1 of the decision tree. Q1 is all about spotting intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly modifying a \"risk-adjective.\"\n\nLet's break it down: The segment is: \"Sometimes those strains [of avian influenza] can get into domestic flocks and mutate into more deadly viruses.\"\n\nI see it immediately: \"more deadly\".  \"More\" is clearly a comparative adjective, and \"deadly\" is a risk-adjective.  The critical point is that \"more\" directly modifies \"deadly.\"  This matches the \"Comparative + Risk-Adj\" pattern explicitly outlined in both the Q1 Pattern Recognition Table and the Detailed Rules. This is a clear indicator of the Alarmist frame.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is definitely \"yes.\" The decisive cue? \"more deadly.\" It perfectly fulfills the requirement of a comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective."}
