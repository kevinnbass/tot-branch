{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Evaluating Risk in the Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at the phrase \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal\" and assessing it against Q1. My initial thought is, this is probably not going to trigger it.\n\nFirstly, the word \"rare\" here is a frequency descriptor, not a risk-modifier. Q1 is looking for intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives, words that would suggest an amplified level of danger, like \"deadly\" or \"severe.\" \"Rare\" doesn't do that. It just tells us how often this happens.\n\nSecondly, the segment does use the word \"infected\" in \"infected animal.\" However, the Q1 list doesn't include \"infected\" as a flagged risk-adjective. Even if it did, there aren't any intensifiers or comparatives modifying it. No \"very infected,\" no \"more infectious,\" nothing like that.\n\nSo, based on my analysis, this segment *doesn't* satisfy the criteria for Q1.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('is rare', 'can occur') and does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases listed in Q2.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: A Neutral Presentation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and told to run it through the Q2 filter of that 12-step decision tree. Essentially, I need to check if the language used is trying to alarm me, specifically looking for those high-potency verbs, loaded metaphors, or superlatives combined with negative nouns. The segment is: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"\n\nAlright, let's break it down. First, the verbs. Are there any dramatic verbs like \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" or \"skyrocketed\"? Nope. Pretty neutral language here: \"is rare\" and \"can occur.\" No hyperbole there. Next, superlatives coupled with negative nouns, like \"worst crisis\" or \"most expensive disaster\"? Nothing like that either.  We're not being told this is the *worst* or *most terrible* anything.  And finally, that \"on high alert\" phrase? Completely absent.\n\nI'm seeing a straightforward, factual statement. \"Rare\" and \"can occur\" are far from alarmist.  So, based on the Q2 criteria, the answer is a definitive \"no.\"  We're proceeding to Q3.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any moderate verbs from the specified list paired with explicit scale or impact information.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q3 Analysis: Evaluating \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to evaluate that segment against Q3 of our decision tree.  My initial step is to identify the verbs; we have \"is\" (a linking verb) and \"can occur.\"  Now, I'm checking if either of those verbs matches our \"moderate verbs\" list.  \"Is\" and \"can occur\" are *definitely* not on that list, which, you know, includes things like \"swept,\" \"surged,\" etc. No dice there.\n\nNext, I need to look for any connection to significant scale or impact. The segment says \"rare\" and \"after close contact.\"  That tells me *how* infection might happen and its likelihood, but it doesn't mention millions, thousands, or anything that screams \"significant impact\" using those specific terms.  So, no.\n\nSince neither the verbs nor the context fulfills Q3's criteria, the answer is a clear \"no.\"  Time to move on to Q4, but that's a problem for another round.\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain a question.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q4 Analysis: No Loaded Rhetorical Questions Detected**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with reviewing this text snippet against the criteria for Q4 – specifically, looking for those loaded rhetorical questions designed to incite alarm. The provided segment reads, \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\"  My immediate assessment is that this is a straightforward declarative statement. It isn't framed as a question in any way, shape, or form.  Therefore, by definition, it doesn't contain a rhetorical question, let alone one that's loaded. My answer to Q4 is unequivocally \"no,\" and the justification is simple: the text segment does not include a question.\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states that infection is 'rare' but lacks explicit calming language or an intensified low-risk evaluation required for Q5.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Calming Cues in the Given Statement**\n\nOkay, so I need to analyze the phrase \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal\" against the criteria for Q5.  Essentially, I'm looking for explicit calming language.\n\nFirst, I parsed the statement: human infection is rare, but it *can* happen.  Then, I ran it against Q5. Q5 wants things like \"no cause for alarm,\" \"safe to eat,\" or \"risk is *very* low.\"  It's about being direct with assurance.\n\nI see that \"rare\" *suggests* a low likelihood, but it doesn't match the specific phrasing Q5 wants.  Q5's got this whole pattern-matching thing going on with intensifiers like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or \"exceptionally\" to explicitly label the *risk* or *likelihood* as low, and this statement doesn't do that. It doesn't use the pattern like `(risk|likelihood|chance)\\s+...\\s+(?:very|extremely|exceptionally|remarkably)\\s+low`.\n\nThere's no other direct assurance of safety, no declarations of confidence, and no talk of things being \"under control.\" So I’m forced to conclude that while the statement *implies* reassurance due to the \"rare\" claim, it doesn't *explicitly* try to reassure per Q5. So, the answer to Q5 is definitely \"no\".\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'rare' but lacks a specified minimiser token (only, just, merely, a single, few) and an explicit scale contrast.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Minimization and Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" The user wants me to apply Q6, specifically checking for that \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern for reassurance. Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I need to pinpoint the \"minimiser.\" \"Rare\" is present, clearly indicating low frequency. But, and this is crucial, the *specific* minimiser tokens outlined in the rules aren't there. We're looking for things like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few.\" \"Rare,\" though it *functions* as a minimiser, isn't on the approved list.\n\nNext, I need to check for the scale contrast. Is the \"rarity\" placed within a broader context that provides a sense of scale? Not really. It doesn't say \"rare *among millions*,\" or \"rare *out of thousands of exposures*.\" We need that clear comparative element to confirm the scale contrast aspect.\n\nSo, Q6 requires *both* a specified minimiser *and* a scale contrast. Since we're missing the crucial specific minimiser token and the scale contrast, the answer here is definitively \"no.\" It's just not a match for the pattern we're looking for. The segment *implies* rarity, but doesn't *explicitly* and *structurally* demonstrate the minimiser-plus-scale-contrast setup required by Q6.\n"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'Human infection is rare' is a bare negation/downplaying statement without an explicit calming cue.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q7 Evaluation: A \"Rare\" Occurrence and a Neutral Frame**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" The task is to see if it triggers Q7, the \"bare negation\" question.\n\nMy understanding of Q7 is that it's flagging statements that downplay something negative, like a risk, without explicitly saying, \"Hey, don't worry.\"  The key phrase here is \"Human infection is rare.\"  Immediately, I recognize this as a form of a \"bare negation\" or downplaying. It's essentially saying something negative *won't* happen very often. It's like saying it's \"unlikely\" or \"not expected frequently.\" The Q7 pattern table has examples of similar things leading to a \"Neutral\" frame, like phrases stating \"unlikely to affect consumers\" or something that \"doesn't pose a risk.\"\n\nNow, does it have an explicit calming cue? Not really. The \"but can occur\" part is just stating a condition where infection *is* possible. It's not a \"calming\" statement. It simply follows the initial negation with a statement of a condition where the opposite is true.\n\nSo, \"Human infection is rare\" stands alone. It's a \"bare negation,\" downplaying the risk, without a clear comforting or reassuring phrase. It's a \"bare negation\" because, in my experience, an expert would see this as a specific risk or \"bare negation\" statement.\n\nThat means Q7 is a \"yes\" and the frame is Neutral. I can provide the rationale by stating the relevant phrase \"Human infection is rare.\"\n"}
