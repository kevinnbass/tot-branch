Q7: \""no\"".\n*   **Segment 6:** Hmm, \""It was not clear how...\"" That's a little tricky but it's really an \""Expectation Negation\"", or maybe a statement of a lack of knowledge. No calming cue. Q7: \""yes\"", bare negation detected. Rationale will capture: \""It was not clear how\"".\n*   **Segment 7:** \""Prevent contact\"".  Wait a minute... that's *instructional*, not a statement about the virus. I initially thought it was a capability negation, but on closer inspection, it doesn't fit. Q7: \""no\"".\n*   **Segment 8:** Aha! \""Does not present a food safety risk\"". That's a classic \""Risk Negation\"", right in line with the examples. No calming language.  Q7: \""yes\"", with the rationale: \""does not present a food safety risk\"".\n*   **Segment 9:** No bare negation. Factual. Q7: \""no\"".\n*   **Segment 10:** No bare negation. Describing actions taken. Q7: \""no\"".\n\nSo, I've identified the \""yes\"" answers and the segments where Q7 would be triggered.

Q7: \""yes\"", bare negation detected. Rationale will capture: \""It was not clear how\"".\n*   **Segment 7:** \""Prevent contact\"".  Wait a minute... that's *instructional*, not a statement about the virus. I initially thought it was a capability negation, but on closer inspection, it doesn't fit.

Q7: \""yes\"", with the rationale: \""does not present a food safety risk\"".\n*   **Segment 9:** No bare negation. Factual. Q7: \""no\"".\n*   **Segment 10:** No bare negation.

My focus is on identifying \""bare negations\"" in these text segments, according to Q7 of the decision tree. I know that if a segment has a bare negation *without* an explicit calming cue, it's a \""yes\"" answer, and we're dealing with a Neutral frame. If there's a calming cue alongside the negation, it's a \""no\"" for Q7 (handled by the previous questions, Q5/Q6, focusing on Reassuring language).\n\nI've carefully reviewed the patterns I'm looking for: expectation negations, evidence negations, risk negations, and capability negations. Plus, there's that specific regex pattern I'm keeping in mind.\n\nHere's my analysis, segment by segment, noting down the reasoning:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** No bare negation. It discusses the rarity of infection. Therefore, Q7 is \""no\"".\n*   **Segment 2:** Bingo! \""No record of Americans contracting\"" is a clear \""Evidence Negation\"". No calming cue either. Q7: \""yes\"", because it uses a bare negation. The rationale to capture: \""no record of Americans contracting\"".\n*   **Segment 3:** No bare negation. This segment reports facts. Q7: \""no\"".\n*   **Segment 4:** No bare negation. It's a factual statement. Q7: \""no\"".\n*   **Segment 5:** No bare negation. Factual reporting here. Q7: \""no\"".\n*   **Segment 6:** Hmm, \""It was not clear how...\"" That's a little tricky but it's really an \""Expectation Negation\"", or maybe a statement of a lack of knowledge. No calming cue. Q7: \""yes\"", bare negation detected. Rationale will capture: \""It was not clear how\"".\n*   **Segment 7:** \""Prevent contact\"".  Wait a minute... that's *instructional*, not a statement about the virus. I initially thought it was a capability negation, but on closer inspection, it doesn't fit. Q7: \""no\"".\n*   **Segment 8:** Aha! \""Does not present a food safety risk\"". That's a classic \""Risk Negation\"", right in line with the examples. No calming language.  Q7: \""yes\"", with the rationale: \""does not present a food safety risk\"".\n*   **Segment 9:** No bare negation. Factual. Q7: \""no\"".\n*   **Segment 10:** No bare negation. Describing actions taken. Q7: \""no\"".\n\nSo, I've identified the \""yes\"" answers and the segments where Q7 would be triggered. Now, to structure this data into that JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \""segment_id\"": 2,\n    \""answer\"": \""yes\"",\n    \""rationale\"": \""no record of Americans contracting\""\n  },\n  {\n    \""segment_id\"": 6,\n    \""answer\"": \""yes\"",\n    \""rationale\"": \""It was not clear how\""\n  },\n  {\n    \""segment_id\"": 8,\n    \""answer\"": \""yes\"",\n    \""rationale\"": \""does not present a food safety risk\""\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThere we go!

In each case, I searched for the specific pattern of an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying one of the predefined risk adjectives (e.g., *deadly, lethal, dangerous*).

In each case, I searched for the specific pattern of an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying one of the predefined risk adjectives (e.g., *deadly, lethal, dangerous*). I considered relevant phrases, such as \""spreading the virus,\"" but excluded these because \""spreading\"" is a verb, not an adjective. I carefully applied the rules and guards.

The task is straightforward: I need to apply Q8 of a decision tree to ten text segments. Q8 focuses on identifying segments that describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful future possibilities, or safeguards, *without* explicitly linking them to present calm or minimized risk. If a segment meets those criteria, it's flagged as \""Neutral\"" at this stage. Otherwise, we move on to the next question, which is not provided here.\n\nMy approach: I carefully examined each segment, comparing it to the specific criteria of Q8. The key is to look for language that suggests the presence of abilities, preparation, optimistic outlooks for the future, or protective measures *in a general sense*, not in the context of addressing immediate risks. I kept an eye out for any active reassurance from the text as well, which is not part of Q8 directly, but helps me determine the general tone.\n\nHere's my analysis of each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** \""Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"" - This is simply factual information about the poultry industry. It doesn't mention capabilities, preparedness, or future prospects. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 2:** \""The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"" - This describes negative events impacting the market. It doesn't reference any form of capabilities, preparedness, or reassurance. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 3:** \""Government data showed U.S. frozen chicken supplies were down 14 percent from a year ago at the end of December while turkey inventories were down 23 percent.\"" - Again, this presents negative facts. No future prospects or capabilities are mentioned. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 4:** \""The United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government.\"" - This is a factual statement of the USA's position in the global market. It does not speak to present or future capabilities. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 5:** \""Kentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken meat-producing state.\"" - This details a fact, like the prior segments. There is no language of safeguards or optimistic futures. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 6:** \""Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"" - Identical to segment 1, this offers more facts. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 7:** \""The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"" - This is a historical description of the virus's spread. It does not meet the requirements of Q8. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 8:** \""Another 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed after bird flu spread to two more Iowa farms, state agriculture officials announced Sunday.\"" - This describes the ongoing negative events. No positive outlook, present safeguards or potential future possibilities. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 9:** \""Since the outbreak began a month ago, millions of fowl have been killed, many of them in Iowa, which is the nation\u2019s leading egg producer.\"" - This again describes negative events as well as factual information.

The task is straightforward: I need to apply Q8 of a decision tree to ten text segments. Q8 focuses on identifying segments that describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful future possibilities, or safeguards, *without* explicitly linking them to present calm or minimized risk. If a segment meets those criteria, it's flagged as \""Neutral\"" at this stage. Otherwise, we move on to the next question, which is not provided here.\n\nMy approach: I carefully examined each segment, comparing it to the specific criteria of Q8. The key is to look for language that suggests the presence of abilities, preparation, optimistic outlooks for the future, or protective measures *in a general sense*, not in the context of addressing immediate risks. I kept an eye out for any active reassurance from the text as well, which is not part of Q8 directly, but helps me determine the general tone.\n\nHere's my analysis of each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** \""Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"" - This is simply factual information about the poultry industry. It doesn't mention capabilities, preparedness, or future prospects. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 2:** \""The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"" - This describes negative events impacting the market. It doesn't reference any form of capabilities, preparedness, or reassurance. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 3:** \""Government data showed U.S. frozen chicken supplies were down 14 percent from a year ago at the end of December while turkey inventories were down 23 percent.\"" - Again, this presents negative facts. No future prospects or capabilities are mentioned. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 4:** \""The United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government.\"" - This is a factual statement of the USA's position in the global market. It does not speak to present or future capabilities. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 5:** \""Kentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken meat-producing state.\"" - This details a fact, like the prior segments. There is no language of safeguards or optimistic futures. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 6:** \""Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"" - Identical to segment 1, this offers more facts. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 7:** \""The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"" - This is a historical description of the virus's spread. It does not meet the requirements of Q8. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 8:** \""Another 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed after bird flu spread to two more Iowa farms, state agriculture officials announced Sunday.\"" - This describes the ongoing negative events. No positive outlook, present safeguards or potential future possibilities. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 9:** \""Since the outbreak began a month ago, millions of fowl have been killed, many of them in Iowa, which is the nation\u2019s leading egg producer.\"" - This again describes negative events as well as factual information.

The task is straightforward: I need to apply Q8 of a decision tree to ten text segments. Q8 focuses on identifying segments that describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful future possibilities, or safeguards, *without* explicitly linking them to present calm or minimized risk. If a segment meets those criteria, it's flagged as \""Neutral\"" at this stage.

No future prospects or capabilities are mentioned. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 4:** \""The United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government.\"" - This is a factual statement of the USA's position in the global market. It does not speak to present or future capabilities. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 5:** \""Kentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken meat-producing state.\"" - This details a fact, like the prior segments. There is no language of safeguards or optimistic futures. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 6:** \""Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"" - Identical to segment 1, this offers more facts. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 7:** \""The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"" - This is a historical description of the virus's spread. It does not meet the requirements of Q8. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 8:** \""Another 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed after bird flu spread to two more Iowa farms, state agriculture officials announced Sunday.\"" - This describes the ongoing negative events.

I kept an eye out for any active reassurance from the text as well, which is not part of Q8 directly, but helps me determine the general tone.\n\nHere's my analysis of each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** \""Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"" - This is simply factual information about the poultry industry. It doesn't mention capabilities, preparedness, or future prospects. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 2:** \""The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"" - This describes negative events impacting the market. It doesn't reference any form of capabilities, preparedness, or reassurance. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 3:** \""Government data showed U.S. frozen chicken supplies were down 14 percent from a year ago at the end of December while turkey inventories were down 23 percent.\"" - Again, this presents negative facts. No future prospects or capabilities are mentioned. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 4:** \""The United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government.\"" - This is a factual statement of the USA's position in the global market. It does not speak to present or future capabilities. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 5:** \""Kentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken meat-producing state.\"" - This details a fact, like the prior segments. There is no language of safeguards or optimistic futures. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 6:** \""Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"" - Identical to segment 1, this offers more facts. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 7:** \""The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"" - This is a historical description of the virus's spread. It does not meet the requirements of Q8. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 8:** \""Another 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed after bird flu spread to two more Iowa farms, state agriculture officials announced Sunday.\"" - This describes the ongoing negative events. No positive outlook, present safeguards or potential future possibilities. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 9:** \""Since the outbreak began a month ago, millions of fowl have been killed, many of them in Iowa, which is the nation\u2019s leading egg producer.\"" - This again describes negative events as well as factual information. Nothing related to safeguards. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 10:** \""The latest cases were at a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County.\"" - This simply identifies locations related to an ongoing issue. **Q8: No.**\n\nIn short, none of these segments meet the criteria for Q8.

My focus is exclusively on Q1 of a 12-step decision tree. This means I'm looking for a particular pattern: whether the segment contains an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective (or the fixed idiom \""deadly from the start/outset\"").  Remember, I only need to determine if Q1 is \""yes\"" or \""no\"" for each segment.\n\nHere's my breakdown, walking through my thought process:\n\n*   **Segments 1-7, 9, and 10:**  For each of these, I carefully scrutinized the text, looking for that specific intensifier-risk adjective pattern.  In all of these cases, I found *no* intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives.  I flagged the instances like \""rare,\"" \""highly pathogenic,\"" or \""safe\"" as cues for later questions in the tree, but they don't trigger Q1 on their own. Phrases like \""large outbreaks\"" or \""spread throughout the world\"" do not apply. I marked each of these segments with \""no\"".\n\n*   **Segment 8:** Ah, here's where it got interesting.  This segment contains the phrase \""so infectious\"".  While \""deadly\"" itself is a risk-adjective, it's not intensified here.

Therefore, **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 4:** The use of \""emerged\"" and \""spread\"" do not rise to the level of high-potency verbs. While the phrase \""throughout the world\"" shows a large scale, the verb \""spread\"" isn't potent enough. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 5:** Even though there's a reference to a significant number of animals being \""killed\"", the verb \""killed\"" doesn't meet the criteria as a vivid, emotionally charged verb, and \""spread\"" is a moderate verb. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 6:** \""Killed\"" appears again, as in Segment 5. \""Millions of fowl have been killed\"" is a high magnitude. However, Q2 is looking for high-potency verbs, and this is a description of an outcome. The scale would be for Q3, not Q2. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 7:** No concerning language here.

The prompt sets the stage: I'm acting as a specialized claim-framing coder, and my task is to assess several text segments based on very specific criteria related to \""alarmist\"" framing. My focus is exclusively on Q1 of a 12-step decision tree. This means I'm looking for a particular pattern: whether the segment contains an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective (or the fixed idiom \""deadly from the start/outset\"").  Remember, I only need to determine if Q1 is \""yes\"" or \""no\"" for each segment.\n\nHere's my breakdown, walking through my thought process:\n\n*   **Segments 1-7, 9, and 10:**  For each of these, I carefully scrutinized the text, looking for that specific intensifier-risk adjective pattern.  In all of these cases, I found *no* intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives.  I flagged the instances like \""rare,\"" \""highly pathogenic,\"" or \""safe\"" as cues for later questions in the tree, but they don't trigger Q1 on their own. Phrases like \""large outbreaks\"" or \""spread throughout the world\"" do not apply. I marked each of these segments with \""no\"".\n\n*   **Segment 8:** Ah, here's where it got interesting.  This segment contains the phrase \""so infectious\"".  While \""deadly\"" itself is a risk-adjective, it's not intensified here. However, I immediately recognized that \""so\"" is an intensifier, directly modifying \""infectious,\"" which is on the risk-adjective list. This single match to the criteria is sufficient for a \""yes\"" answer based on the instructions.

Therefore, **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 4:** The use of \""emerged\"" and \""spread\"" do not rise to the level of high-potency verbs.

The task is straightforward: I need to apply Q8 of a decision tree to ten text segments. Q8 focuses on identifying segments that describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful future possibilities, or safeguards, *without* explicitly linking them to present calm or minimized risk. If a segment meets those criteria, it's flagged as \""Neutral\"" at this stage.

It does not speak to present or future capabilities. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 5:** \""Kentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken meat-producing state.\"" - This details a fact, like the prior segments. There is no language of safeguards or optimistic futures. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 6:** \""Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"" - Identical to segment 1, this offers more facts. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 7:** \""The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"" - This is a historical description of the virus's spread.

Therefore, **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 4:** The use of \""emerged\"" and \""spread\"" do not rise to the level of high-potency verbs.

It does not speak to present or future capabilities. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 5:** \""Kentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken meat-producing state.\"" - This details a fact, like the prior segments. There is no language of safeguards or optimistic futures. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 6:** \""Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"" - Identical to segment 1, this offers more facts. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 7:** \""The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"" - This is a historical description of the virus's spread.

The task is straightforward: I need to apply Q8 of a decision tree to ten text segments. Q8 focuses on identifying segments that describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful future possibilities, or safeguards, *without* explicitly linking them to present calm or minimized risk. If a segment meets those criteria, it's flagged as \""Neutral\"" at this stage. Otherwise, we move on to the next question, which is not provided here.\n\nMy approach: I carefully examined each segment, comparing it to the specific criteria of Q8.

It does not speak to present or future capabilities. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 5:** \""Kentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken meat-producing state.\"" - This details a fact, like the prior segments. There is no language of safeguards or optimistic futures. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 6:** \""Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"" - Identical to segment 1, this offers more facts. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 7:** \""The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"" - This is a historical description of the virus's spread.
