{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' modifies the risk-adjective 'infectious'.", "thoughts": "**My Expert Evaluation: Analyzing Text Segments for Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, here's how I approached this. The prompt sets the stage: I'm acting as a specialized claim-framing coder, and my task is to assess several text segments based on very specific criteria related to \"alarmist\" framing. My focus is exclusively on Q1 of a 12-step decision tree. This means I'm looking for a particular pattern: whether the segment contains an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective (or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\").  Remember, I only need to determine if Q1 is \"yes\" or \"no\" for each segment.\n\nHere's my breakdown, walking through my thought process:\n\n*   **Segments 1-7, 9, and 10:**  For each of these, I carefully scrutinized the text, looking for that specific intensifier-risk adjective pattern.  In all of these cases, I found *no* intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives.  I flagged the instances like \"rare,\" \"highly pathogenic,\" or \"safe\" as cues for later questions in the tree, but they don't trigger Q1 on their own. Phrases like \"large outbreaks\" or \"spread throughout the world\" do not apply. I marked each of these segments with \"no\".\n\n*   **Segment 8:** Ah, here's where it got interesting.  This segment contains the phrase \"so infectious\".  While \"deadly\" itself is a risk-adjective, it's not intensified here. However, I immediately recognized that \"so\" is an intensifier, directly modifying \"infectious,\" which is on the risk-adjective list. This single match to the criteria is sufficient for a \"yes\" answer based on the instructions.  I immediately marked this segment with \"yes\" and framed it as \"Alarmist\".\n\nNow that I have reviewed all the segments, I am preparing the output, a single JSON array with the information requested (segment\\_id, answer, and rationale for Q1=Yes).\n"}
