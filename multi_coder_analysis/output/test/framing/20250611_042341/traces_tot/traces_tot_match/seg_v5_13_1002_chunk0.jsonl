{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**My Expert Evaluation: Analyzing Text Segments for Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, here's how I approached this. The prompt sets the stage: I'm acting as a specialized claim-framing coder, and my task is to assess several text segments based on very specific criteria related to \"alarmist\" framing. My focus is exclusively on Q1 of a 12-step decision tree. This means I'm looking for a particular pattern: whether the segment contains an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective (or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\").  Remember, I only need to determine if Q1 is \"yes\" or \"no\" for each segment.\n\nHere's my breakdown, walking through my thought process:\n\n*   **Segments 1-7, 9, and 10:**  For each of these, I carefully scrutinized the text, looking for that specific intensifier-risk adjective pattern.  In all of these cases, I found *no* intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives.  I flagged the instances like \"rare,\" \"highly pathogenic,\" or \"safe\" as cues for later questions in the tree, but they don't trigger Q1 on their own. Phrases like \"large outbreaks\" or \"spread throughout the world\" do not apply. I marked each of these segments with \"no\".\n\n*   **Segment 8:** Ah, here's where it got interesting.  This segment contains the phrase \"so infectious\".  While \"deadly\" itself is a risk-adjective, it's not intensified here. However, I immediately recognized that \"so\" is an intensifier, directly modifying \"infectious,\" which is on the risk-adjective list. This single match to the criteria is sufficient for a \"yes\" answer based on the instructions.  I immediately marked this segment with \"yes\" and framed it as \"Alarmist\".\n\nNow that I have reviewed all the segments, I am preparing the output, a single JSON array with the information requested (segment\\_id, answer, and rationale for Q1=Yes).\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes production and usage statistics factually, without high-potency verbs or metaphors.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis Summary**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of each segment, applying my expertise in claim framing and focusing solely on Q2's criteria: High-Potency Verbs and Metaphors. My focus here is to identify if any segment employs language that's alarmist, as defined by the presence of strong verbs or potent metaphors.\n\n*   **Segment 1:** This segment is straightforward, and doesn't contain any high-impact language. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 2:** While this segment provides information about the rarity of infections, it doesn't utilize any high-potency language. The statement about \"rare\" is actually quite calming, but that's a question for Q4 or Q5. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 3:** The phrase \"highly pathogenic avian flu viruses\" could be alarming to a layperson, but the instructions are to ignore this technical language. Therefore, **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 4:** The use of \"emerged\" and \"spread\" do not rise to the level of high-potency verbs. While the phrase \"throughout the world\" shows a large scale, the verb \"spread\" isn't potent enough. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 5:** Even though there's a reference to a significant number of animals being \"killed\", the verb \"killed\" doesn't meet the criteria as a vivid, emotionally charged verb, and \"spread\" is a moderate verb. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 6:** \"Killed\" appears again, as in Segment 5. \"Millions of fowl have been killed\" is a high magnitude. However, Q2 is looking for high-potency verbs, and this is a description of an outcome. The scale would be for Q3, not Q2. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 7:** No concerning language here. This is purely factual. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 8:** The focus here is on *not* presenting a public health concern. This is an explicit reassuring statement, not an alarmist one. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 9:** Similar to the previous segment, this one offers reassurance by stating that there have been no cases detected, and that it's safe to eat poultry. **Answer: no.**\n\nBased on my analysis of each text segment, and applying the strict criteria of Q2, my conclusion is that none of the segments employ high-potency verbs or metaphors. Therefore, I'm confident in declaring that the answer for each segment is \"no.\" I'm now ready to generate the JSON output.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "Segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with scale/impact.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Q3 of the Decision Tree**\n\nAlright, I've got the task of applying Q3 to these text segments. Essentially, I'm looking for \"moderate verbs\" that are paired with a clear indication of \"significant scale or impact.\" I know the \"moderate verbs\" list like the back of my hand: `hit`, `swept`, `surged`, `soared`, `plunged`, `plummeted`, `prompted`, `feared`, `fearing`, and `were/was culled`. And the \"significant scale\" needs to be explicit, like \"millions,\" or \"record losses,\" representing real-world realized impact, not just future plans or hypotheticals.\n\nSo, let's dive into each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** No dice here. No moderate verbs, no impact. Easy \"no\" for Q3.\n*   **Segment 2:** Same story. No moderate verbs. Another \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 3:** Still nothing. No moderate verbs in sight. \"No\" it is.\n*   **Segment 4:** The verbs \"emerged,\" \"leading,\" and \"spread\" are present, but none of them are on the moderate verb list. \"No\" again.\n*   **Segment 5:**  Here, we have \"killed\" and \"spread\". \"Killed\" is the stumbling block, it's not on the moderate verbs list. Even with the specific numbers, the future tense \"will have to be killed\" denotes plans. Another \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 6:** \"Millions of fowl have been killed.\" Now, this one initially gave me pause. We *do* have \"millions\" and the verb \"killed,\" but my initial impression is overridden by the strict reading of the rules. The cheat sheet and the detailed rules both explicitly say that plain verbs like \"killed\" are *excluded* from triggering Q3. Even though it's \"millions,\" the verb itself doesn't meet the criteria, so this one's also a \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 7:** Another simple case. No moderate verbs.\n*   **Segment 8:**  Nada. No moderate verbs or impact.\n*   **Segment 9:** Still a \"no.\"\n\nIt seems like I'm giving a lot of \"no\" answers. It all boils down to sticking rigidly to the defined criteria. All of these segments are \"no\" for Q3, which I will deliver in a JSON array format.\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a loaded rhetorical question.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Alarm-Implying Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, here's the rundown. I've been tasked with acting as a highly specific claim-framing coder, essentially a linguistic filter, and applying a rigorous 12-step decision tree to various text segments. I'm currently at step Q4, which focuses on identifying \"Loaded Rhetorical Questions for Alarm.\"  My objective is to meticulously examine each segment and determine if it contains a loaded rhetorical question crafted to evoke a sense of alarm.\n\nFollowing the strict guidelines - the Bedrock Principle, Symmetry Rule, Context Guard, Precedence Ladder, and the Mandatory Step-by-Step Decision Process - I've worked through each segment.  \n\nFirst, I looked for any question at all. There were none. Consequently, the answer to Q4 for every single segment is a resounding \"no.\"  There are no loaded rhetorical questions present.\n\nNow, I'll package this into a JSON array, as required, with the appropriate `segment_id`, `answer` (\"no\" in all cases), and a concise `rationale` indicating the absence of any such question.\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment provides factual information about poultry production and exports, lacking explicit calming language.", "thoughts": "**Expert Claim Framing Analysis - Q5: Explicit Calming Cue for Reassurance**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The task is to analyze text segments for explicit reassurance cues, focusing on the \"Explicit Calming Cue for Reassurance\" rule (Q5).  I've got to follow the Bedrock Principle, Symmetry Rule, Context Guard, Precedence Ladder, and the Mandatory Step-by-Step Decision Process.  Here's how I see it:\n\n*   **Segment 1 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_13\\_1002\\_chunk0):**  Straightforward factual statement about poultry exports and feed grains.  No calming cue here.  \"No\" is the answer.\n*   **Segment 2 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_14\\_1002\\_chunk0):**  \"Considered rare\" is a bare low-risk statement. While it touches on risk, it doesn't amplify it. Based on the Q5 table and definition, it falls under Neutral, not Reassuring. So, \"no\".\n*   **Segment 3 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_15\\_1002\\_chunk0):**  A bare positive fact (\"No Americans...\").  This is a Neutral fact.  Therefore, \"no\".\n*   **Segment 4 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_16\\_1002\\_chunk0):**  Historical context about the virus.  No calming language.  \"No\".\n*   **Segment 5 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_1\\_100\\_chunk0):**  Negative information about animal deaths and farm spread. Not reassuring.  \"No\".\n*   **Segment 6 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_2\\_100\\_chunk0):**  More negative information, concerning animal deaths. Not reassuring. \"No\".\n*   **Segment 7 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_3\\_100\\_chunk0):**  Simply states the location of cases. No calming elements. \"No\".\n*   **Segment 8 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_5\\_100\\_chunk0):**  \"Do not present an immediate public health concern.\"  This is a *bare* negation. Q5 explicitly categorizes this as Neutral. \"No\".\n*   **Segment 9 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_6\\_100\\_chunk0):**  \"No human cases... have been detected\" is a bare positive (Neutral). However, \"It remains safe to eat poultry products\" is a direct assurance of safety, similar to \"completely safe\" in the Q5 table. This is an explicit attempt to calm the audience and falls under the definition of Reassuring. Therefore, \"yes\" here.\n\n**Self-Audit (performed):** I've checked each segment against the Q5 definition and table, noting the nuances between Neutral and Reassuring, and ensuring the rationale adheres to the token limit. The application of the 12-step decision process was consistent across each segment. I strictly followed the given rules, checking and double checking.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_13_1002_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"States factual information about poultry production and feed grains.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_14_1002_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Mentions a low risk ('considered rare') but doesn't amplify it.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_15_1002_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"A bare positive statement; lacks an explicit calming cue.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_16_1002_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Provides historical context; no calming language used.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_1_100_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Reports negative facts (animal deaths and farm spread).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_2_100_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Reports negative facts (millions of fowl killed).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a 'minimiser + scale contrast' pattern.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segments for Reassuring Framing (Q6)**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of each text segment, keeping in mind I'm currently assessing for the 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' pattern, specifically within the context of the Reassuring framing step at Q6 in the decision tree. I'm looking for instances where a minimiser like 'only', 'just', 'merely', 'a single', or 'few' is used alongside an explicit or implied scale contrast (like 'out of thousands' or 'among millions') to downplay the significance of something. Bare numerals alone don't count unless preceded by a minimiser.\n\nI went through each segment meticulously:\n\n*   **Segment 1 (seg\\_v5\\_012\\_1003\\_chunk0):** This one uses a \"do not\" statement, which is a key signal for Q5, which deals with low-risk statements; however, it does not use a minimiser or scale contrast, and is therefore, not coded as a minimiser. The answer is \"no\".\n*   **Segment 2 (seg\\_v5\\_013\\_1003\\_chunk0):** The term \"dozens\" is used, which does not employ a minimiser, and therefore, does not satisfy the requirements of the question. The answer is \"no\".\n*   **Segment 3 (seg\\_v5\\_014\\_1003\\_chunk0) & Segment 8 (seg\\_v5\\_11\\_1002\\_chunk0):** These segments are identical and state rankings. However, they don't have a minimiser paired with a scale contrast. The answer is \"no\".\n*   **Segment 4 (seg\\_v5\\_015\\_1003\\_chunk0) & Segment 9 (seg\\_v5\\_12\\_1002\\_chunk0):** Identical segments, referencing rankings and production volume. The answer is \"no\".\n*   **Segment 5 (seg\\_v5\\_016\\_1003\\_chunk0) & Segment 10 (seg\\_v5\\_13\\_1002\\_chunk0):** These segments are identical and reference percentage. These statements do not employ a minimiser or scale contrast. The answer is \"no\".\n*   **Segment 6 (seg\\_v5\\_017\\_1003\\_chunk0) & Segment 7 (seg\\_v5\\_018\\_1003\\_chunk0):** Neither of these statements contain the specific 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' pattern I'm looking for. The answer is \"no\".\n\nIn every single case, the necessary combination of a minimiser and a scale contrast wasn't present. Thus, the answer to Q6 for all segments is definitively \"no\". The rationale boils down to the simple fact that the specific pattern the question probes for, the combination of a minimizer and a scale contrast, was entirely absent in the provided text.\n"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a bare negation.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Bare Negations**\n\nRight, let's get down to business. I'm focusing on identifying \"bare negations\" within these text segments, specifically looking for phrases that deny a negative outcome without offering any explicit reassurance. I'm at Q7 of the decision tree, and the rule is clear: find the bare negation, but *only* if it's unaccompanied by a calming cue.\n\nMy process is straightforward: I'm scanning each segment for negations like \"not expected,\" \"no cases,\" \"tests were negative,\" or \"do not present a concern.\"  If I find one, I immediately check for any explicit calming language like \"consumers can rest easy\" or \"the risk is very low.\"  If the negation stands alone, with no comfort offered, it's a \"yes\" for Q7 and falls under the Neutral frame. If there's a calming cue alongside the negation, it's a \"no\" for Q7, because it's essentially a Reassuring cue that's already been handled in Q5.\n\nFor each segment, I'm returning a JSON object that includes the `segment_id`, my `answer` (\"yes\" or \"no\"), and the `rationale` for my decision.\n\nSo, here's how it shakes out:\n\n*   **Segment 1 (seg\\_v5\\_012\\_1003\\_chunk0):**  The segment explicitly states, \"do not present an immediate public health concern.\" That's a textbook bare negation. And there's no calming cue to be found.  **Answer: \"yes\". Rationale: The bare negation is \"do not present an immediate public health concern.\"**\n*   **Segments 2-10 (rest of segments):**  I've reviewed the other segments. None of them contain a \"bare negation\" as defined. No negations, no problem. **Answer: \"no\". Rationale: No bare negation found.**\n\nWith that, I've processed all the text segments, applying my expertise in framing and analyzing for these specific linguistic patterns. I'm ready to move on.\n"}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states facts about exports and industry usage, not capabilities or preparedness.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments with the Q8 Decision Rule**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The task is straightforward: I need to apply Q8 of a decision tree to ten text segments. Q8 focuses on identifying segments that describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful future possibilities, or safeguards, *without* explicitly linking them to present calm or minimized risk. If a segment meets those criteria, it's flagged as \"Neutral\" at this stage. Otherwise, we move on to the next question, which is not provided here.\n\nMy approach: I carefully examined each segment, comparing it to the specific criteria of Q8. The key is to look for language that suggests the presence of abilities, preparation, optimistic outlooks for the future, or protective measures *in a general sense*, not in the context of addressing immediate risks. I kept an eye out for any active reassurance from the text as well, which is not part of Q8 directly, but helps me determine the general tone.\n\nHere's my analysis of each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\" - This is simply factual information about the poultry industry. It doesn't mention capabilities, preparedness, or future prospects. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 2:** \"The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic.\" - This describes negative events impacting the market. It doesn't reference any form of capabilities, preparedness, or reassurance. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 3:** \"Government data showed U.S. frozen chicken supplies were down 14 percent from a year ago at the end of December while turkey inventories were down 23 percent.\" - Again, this presents negative facts. No future prospects or capabilities are mentioned. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 4:** \"The United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government.\" - This is a factual statement of the USA's position in the global market. It does not speak to present or future capabilities. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 5:** \"Kentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken meat-producing state.\" - This details a fact, like the prior segments. There is no language of safeguards or optimistic futures. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 6:** \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\" - Identical to segment 1, this offers more facts. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 7:** \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\" - This is a historical description of the virus's spread. It does not meet the requirements of Q8. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 8:** \"Another 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed after bird flu spread to two more Iowa farms, state agriculture officials announced Sunday.\" - This describes the ongoing negative events. No positive outlook, present safeguards or potential future possibilities. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 9:** \"Since the outbreak began a month ago, millions of fowl have been killed, many of them in Iowa, which is the nation’s leading egg producer.\" - This again describes negative events as well as factual information. Nothing related to safeguards. **Q8: No.**\n*   **Segment 10:** \"The latest cases were at a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County.\" - This simply identifies locations related to an ongoing issue. **Q8: No.**\n\nIn short, none of these segments meet the criteria for Q8. They are all descriptive of events and facts, but do not meet any of the defined areas for Q8.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 1,\n    \"answer\": \"No\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Describes facts about the industry (exports, feed grain usage).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 2,\n    \"answer\": \"No\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Describes negative market facts (disease, labor shortages).\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 3,\n    \"answer\": \"No\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Describes negative inventory statistics.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\":"}
