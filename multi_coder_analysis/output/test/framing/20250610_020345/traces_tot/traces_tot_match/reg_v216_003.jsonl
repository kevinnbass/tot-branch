{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'highly pathogenic' is part of the technical name 'highly pathogenic avian flu' and is explicitly excluded as an Alarmist cue under Q1 rules.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Framing: Q1 Evaluation**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\"  My task is to apply Q1 from the decision tree. That means I need to look for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nI immediately spot \"highly pathogenic avian flu.\"  Now, I'm already thinking about the nuances here because I know the rules specifically address phrases like this. The instructions clearly state that \"highly pathogenic,\" when part of the formal name for the disease (HPAI), is *neutral*, unless there are *other* alarmist cues present.\n\nThe key is that \"highly pathogenic\" isn't being used as an authorial intensifier, like if it said something like \"a highly *dangerous* flu.\" Instead, it's integral to the scientific nomenclature. The regex pattern actually *accounts* for this, using a negative lookahead to explicitly *ignore* \"highly pathogenic avian flu\" or \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\" as alarmist cues.\n\nSo, according to my understanding of the rules, this phrase *doesn't* qualify as an instance of an intensifier modifying a risk adjective in an alarmist way. Therefore, my answer to Q1 is \"no.\" This is because the phrase, while containing \"highly,\" is part of a standard scientific term, not a subjective judgment intended to amplify the perceived risk."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'infected' is a neutral, factual description, not a high-potency verb or potent metaphor as defined for Q2.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against the Decision Tree (Q2)**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've been tasked with assessing a text segment – \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu\" – against Q2 of the decision tree. My expert judgment, based on my understanding of this field, is that Q2 is all about spotting alarmist framing. Specifically, it's looking for those high-impact verbs or those potent metaphors that ratchet up the fear factor, you know? Think \"decimated,\" \"catastrophic,\" things like that.\n\nSo, I dove into this sentence. The verb is \"were infected.\" Now, \"infected\" is a clinical term, it's factual. It *describes* a condition, not the sensationalization of it. I'm not seeing any hyperbolic language here, no metaphorical landmines ready to blow up the reader's perception. The phrase \"highly pathogenic avian flu\" does accurately characterize the flu strain. However, that phrase is a description of the virus itself, not the way the event of infection is *framed*. The Bedrock Principle is key here: We code the *presentation*, not just the facts. A severe fact, presented neutrally, is just that - neutral.\n\nBased on my analysis and the definitions I've been provided, my conclusion is clear. This segment doesn't use any alarmist verbs or metaphors that would trigger a \"yes\" response to Q2. It's a straightforward description. Therefore, I'm going to answer \"no\" to this question and move on to the next hop in the decision tree (Q3). I'll output that in JSON format as expected."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'were infected' is not on the list of moderate verbs for Q3, nor is it paired with scale/impact information.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of Question Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm evaluating this text segment, \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu,\" against Question Q3. Q3 is looking for a *moderate verb* from a specific list, linked to information about *significant scale or impact*.\n\nFirst, let's look at the verb. It's \"were infected.\"  I immediately check it against the established criteria. The rules explicitly state that verbs like \"killed,\" \"died,\" \"affected,\" and \"reported\" are excluded, and \"infected\" definitely falls into that same category of a plain outcome verb. I'm also confirming it against the regex: `\\b(hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|culled)\\b`, and it's not present.\n\nEven if \"infected\" were somehow debatable, there's no accompanying information about the scale or impact. The segment doesn't tell me how many chickens were infected or the extent of the impact. The rules emphasize the need for both: an approved moderate verb *and* scale/impact data.\n\nSince \"infected\" isn't a qualifying verb, and there's no impact information, I know the answer to Q3 is a firm \"no.\" We can definitely move on to the next question based on that."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain a question.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a task related to a decision tree and need to analyze the text segment: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\" Specifically, I'm checking it against Q4 of the tree, which is looking for *loaded rhetorical questions designed to imply alarm*.\n\nFirst things first, I read the text. Then, I re-familiarize myself with Q4's specific criteria. Now, I simply assess the segment: does it *contain a question* at all? That's the primary hurdle here.\n\nClearly, it's a declarative statement. No question mark, no implied question, nothing that even remotely resembles a question structure. Since it doesn't contain a question, it certainly doesn't contain a *rhetorical* question, let alone a *loaded* one.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q4 is unequivocally \"no.\" The rationale is straightforward: the text segment in question does not present any question, rhetorical or otherwise."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a fact about chicken infection but contains no explicit language from the author or source to calm concerns or assure safety.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Calming Cues in Claim Framing**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\"  I need to check it against Q5 of the 12-step decision tree for claim framing. Essentially, I'm looking for explicit signals of reassurance, stuff like \"Don't worry,\" \"Everything's under control,\" or \"The risk is minimal.\"\n\nRight away, I see the phrase \"highly pathogenic\" – that's a red flag in terms of calming language.  While it *describes* the flu strain, it's not directly related to the *impact* of said strain on humans or the general public.  No calming language here at all.\n\nThis segment is purely factual: chickens got infected. There's no attempt to contextualize that fact in terms of public safety or to provide any sort of reassurance.\n\nTherefore, Q5 is a clear \"no.\" No explicit calming cues are present. This means I'll need to answer 'no', and provide a rationale in JSON format."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser word combined with a scale contrast.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Reassurance Language**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\"  My task, as I understand it, is to apply my expertise and determine if this contains the specific pattern we're looking for, specifically the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" reassurance strategy, per question Q6 of the decision tree.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the criteria. I'm searching for two elements: a minimiser word (something like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"a few\") and a contrasting scale or context that downplays the scope of the issue (e.g., \"among millions,\" \"nationwide,\" \"out of thousands\").\n\nI'll dissect the sentence piece by piece: \"Broiler chickens were infected...\"  Nope, nothing there. No minimiser, no hint of a larger scale.  Moving on, \"...with the same H5N1 strain...\" Still nothing.  No minimiser, no contrasting context. And finally, \"...of highly pathogenic avian flu.\"  Again, nothing.  This section merely states a fact - chickens infected with a specific flu strain - without trying to soften the blow.\n\nTherefore, the critical pattern isn't present. There's no attempt to minimize the severity of the situation through the use of words or phrases, and there's no attempt to put the infection in perspective with a larger scale.\n\nMy response to Q6 will be \"no.\" The rationale is simple: The text segment doesn't contain the combination of a minimiser word and a contrasting scale or context that would trigger a \"yes\" answer."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a fact about infection and does not contain any form of negation.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this statement: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\" and need to determine if it fails the Q7 test, which I know is all about catching 'bare negation' without a calming cue.\n\nFirst, I quickly scan the text. It's a straightforward factual statement. No \"not,\" no \"never,\" nothing like that - it's a positive assertion. Clearly, it doesn't contain any negation.\n\nNow, Q7 is specifically targeting that simple \"no\" without any context to mitigate the impact. Since there's no negation to begin with, there's no way it's a case of bare negation.\n\nSo, the answer is a resounding \"no.\" I'll need to explain this simply: the statement doesn't contain any negation, so it cannot be a 'bare negation' situation. Easy enough."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes an infection event and the nature of the virus, not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess this segment against Question Q8 of the decision tree. Q8 is looking for statements that describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards *without* explicitly relating them to current calm, safety, or minimized risk. Let's break it down.\n\nThe segment clearly states a factual occurrence: broiler chickens *were* infected. It also describes a key characteristic of the virus involved: it's a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain. My immediate thought is that this is simply a statement of fact, a report of what happened.\n\nI have to carefully consider the criteria for Q8. Does this describe a capability? No. Does it describe preparedness? No. Is it expressing a hopeful possibility? Not at all. Does it mention any safeguards that were in place, or that are being planned? Nope. It's just a straightforward reporting of an event and the properties of the virus involved.\n\nTherefore, because this segment doesn't discuss capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards – it's a \"no\" answer for Q8. It's simply not what the question is looking for. It's a statement about a past event and its characteristics; it's not a statement about the items listed in Q8. So, I will proceed to question Q9, but since I am only asked to answer Q8, I will stop here."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports on a health/disease issue (avian flu infection), not prices, economic data, or numerical metrics as defined by Q9.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Provided Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\"  My task, as I understand it, is to assess whether this aligns with Q9 of the decision tree. Q9, as I recall, is the one that asks about whether the segment is primarily focused on reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics, using pretty standard, neutral language.  No fancy verbs, no risky adjectives, no explicit framing.\n\nRight away, I see this is about something completely different – a health issue, specifically avian flu in chickens.  It's describing a biological process, an infection. There's no economic data here, no prices, no numerical metrics being explicitly reported in the way Q9 is looking for. It describes a biological event rather than economic or numerical data.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is clear: This segment does *not* fit the criteria for Q9.  My answer has to be \"no\". And the rationale is straightforward: it's not reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics, but rather a biological event."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a past event (chickens were infected) and does not contain language speculating about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q10**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu,\" and I need to evaluate it against Question Q10 of the decision tree. Q10 essentially wants to know if this segment *speculates* about future relief or improvement without explicitly calming the current situation. My goal is to determine if there's any forward-looking speculation present.\n\nInitially, I dissect the sentence. I see it clearly describes a past event – chickens *were* infected. It also pinpoints the cause, the H5N1 strain. Crucially, I'm looking for indicators of speculation, and that means modal verbs like \"may,\" \"might,\" or \"could,\" or predictive language such as \"expect,\" \"predict,\" or even hopeful terms. I'm also watching out for timeline clues like \"soon\" or \"next quarter\" which might imply a future perspective.\n\nHowever, none of those things are present. The sentence is purely factual. It states what *happened*.  There's no speculation on potential future improvement or relief.\n\nSo, for Q10, my answer is a definitive \"no\".\n\nFollowing the instructions, since it's \"no,\" I move on to the next step, which is Q11. At this stage, I don't assign a frame. My output will simply reflect this \"no\" answer, along with a clear rationale – a breakdown of why this segment doesn't meet the criteria of speculating about future relief without an accompanying calming cue. I need to be ready to analyze Q11 next."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any direct quotations or attributed statements from a source.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment and Application of Q11**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess this segment, \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu,\" against Q11. That's the one that flags dominant framed quotations. Let's see...\n\nFirst, I need to *really* look at this text.  Right away, I can tell there aren't any direct quotations. No quotation marks, no phrases like \"according to X,\" nothing that would indicate someone's *exact* words are being presented.\n\nNow, Q11 is pretty clear. It's specifically looking for situations where a directly quoted source frames the narrative. Since there are no direct quotes *at all* here, the condition for Q11 can't possibly be satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is clearly \"no.\" There's no framing happening *through* a direct quotation because there are *no* direct quotations. Simple as that.\n\nI'll formulate the rationale succinctly, stating that the segment lacks any direct quotations. I'll make sure it's clear and concise in the JSON object I'm about to construct."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Reports infection with a technically described virus strain using factual, descriptive language without added alarmist or reassuring rhetoric.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis: Framing the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I'm at the final step, Q12. The text to frame is: \"Broiler chickens were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu.\" I need to determine if this segment is neutral, given that no alarmist or reassuring cues remain.\n\nI've analyzed the text. It describes a factual event: chickens being infected with a specific virus. The description is straightforward:\n\n*   \"Infected with\" is a factual statement.\n*   \"H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu\" is a technical description. The phrase \"highly pathogenic\" is part of the scientific classification of the virus, not an alarmist intensification.\n\nI've checked for alarmist cues – intensifiers, vivid verbs, exaggeration, loaded metaphors. There are none. \"Infected\" is a neutral verb. \"Highly pathogenic\" describes the *virus* itself. The Context Guard for vivid language applies.\n\nI've checked for reassuring cues – explicit calming, risk minimization. There are none.\n\nThe presentation is purely factual and descriptive. It states a negative fact – infection with a dangerous virus – using objective language. This aligns with the \"Severe Fact, Neutral Presentation\" example.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q12 is \"yes.\" The frame is **Neutral**. The rationale is that the segment reports a negative fact using factual language without any alarmist or reassuring rhetoric. \"Highly pathogenic\" is a technical term.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"frame\": \"Neutral\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment reports a negative fact (infection with a dangerous virus) using factual, descriptive language.
