{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective, nor the fixed idiom.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a segment and tasked with evaluating it against the first question of the 12-step decision tree, which is looking for specific linguistic indicators of heightened risk.  Specifically, Q1 is fishing for intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives, or the fixed phrase \"deadly from the start/outset.\"\n\nFirst, I read the segment: \"Tyson said its chicken products remain safe for consumers, and it is working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.\"\n\nI immediately scan for those intensifiers - the \"very\"s and \"extremely\"s, the \"more\"s and \"less\"s.  I don't see anything like that.  I'm also looking for those risk-adjectives: words like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" \"catastrophic,\" or \"contagious.\" \"Safe\" stands out, but that's the opposite; it's a positive adjective.  There's no comparative or intensifier modifying \"safe,\" or indeed, any other word that might remotely be construed as a risk-adjective.\n\nAnd, of course, the fixed idiom isn't there.\n\nSo, according to Q1, this segment is a \"no-go\". No intensifier or comparative modifies a risk adjective and the fixed idiom isn't present.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or the phrase 'on high alert' as defined by Q2.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against Q2**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and need to determine if it triggers Question 2 of the decision tree. My immediate focus is on those alarmist indicators: potent verbs, metaphors, superlative/negative noun combinations, and that \"on high alert\" phrase. I quickly skimmed the segment: \"Tyson said its chicken products remain safe for consumers, and it is working with state and federal officials to prevent the spread of the virus.\"\n\nFirst, I checked for those high-octane verbs—you know, the \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" \"skyrocketed\" types. Nope, nothing there. Then, I looked for any superlative + negative noun pairings—nothing like \"worst catastrophe\" or \"most disastrous outcome.\" The \"on high alert\" phrase? Nope, not even close. Finally, I scanned for any potent metaphors, those \"ticking time-bomb\" or \"inferno\" types. Nada.\n\nI noted the verb \"prevent,\" but that's a perfectly reasonable action verb in this context. It's not *framing* the situation as alarmist; it's describing an attempt to mitigate a risk. The phrase \"safe for consumers\" certainly stands out, but that's more about reassurance and safety, which I know is addressed in later questions.\n\nSo, after a thorough review, I'm confident in saying the answer to Q2 is \"no.\" I'll now move on to Q3.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any moderate verbs from the specified list paired with scale or impact information.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q3 Evaluation: A Quick Look**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and need to run it through my mental checklist for Q3 of the decision tree.  My primary focus here is to see if it meets the criteria: are there any \"moderate verbs\" coupled with explicit scale or impact information?\n\nFirst, I quickly scan the phrase, and I see three potential verbs that catch my eye: \"remain safe,\" \"is working,\" and \"prevent.\"  Then, I compare these against my mental list – the \"moderate verbs\" associated with Q3. Things like \"hit,\" \"surged,\" \"plunged,\" etc.  I don't see any direct matches.  None of those verbs are in the snippet.\n\nNext, I need to look for any explicit scale or impact information tied to those verbs, just in case. \"Safe for consumers\" and \"prevent the spread\" are mentioned. These are about consequences, but they are not specific numbers. The prompt mentions examples like \"millions culled\" or \"record losses,\" which are definitely absent here.\n\nSince I found no \"moderate verbs\" from my mental list, nor any specific scale/impact information, it's a clear \"no\" for Q3.  I'm ready to move on.\n"}

No questions. Not a single one. This is just a straightforward statement from Tyson. They are declaring their products are safe and outlining collaborative efforts.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q4 is clearly \"no.\" Time to move on to Q5.\n"}
