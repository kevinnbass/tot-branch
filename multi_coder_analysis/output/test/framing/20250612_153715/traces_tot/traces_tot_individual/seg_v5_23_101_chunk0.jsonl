{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Segment Against Q1**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the segment \"Egg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015\" and I need to assess it against Q1 of the decision tree. Q1 is straightforward: does the segment have an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective?\n\nLet's break it down. \"Egg prices soared\" – well, \"soared\" is a vivid verb, definitely grabbing the reader's attention and communicating the *effect* on prices, but it's not an intensifier modifying a risk-adjective.  \"Soared\" could be relevant for Q2 because it's a vivid verb, but not for Q1.\n\nThen we have \"outbreak ravaged the United States.\" Again, \"ravaged\" is a very descriptive verb. It powerfully depicts the impact, but it doesn't fit the intensifier + risk-adjective pattern required by Q1. It’s also a candidate for Q2, but not Q1.\n\nTherefore, looking at the entire segment, I can confidently conclude that the answer to Q1 is \"no.\" There are no intensifiers modifying risk-adjectives here. It’s a pretty easy call.\n"}
