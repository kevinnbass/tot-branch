{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective, nor the 'deadly from the start' idiom.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: \"BIRD FLU OUTBREAKS PUT US POULTRY FARMS ON HIGH ALERT\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at the phrase \"BIRD FLU OUTBREAKS PUT US POULTRY FARMS ON HIGH ALERT\" through the lens of Q1 in the 12-step decision tree. My initial thought is to break it down. I see \"BIRD FLU OUTBREAKS\" – that's the factual event. Then, \"PUT US POULTRY FARMS ON HIGH ALERT.\" That second part is key.\n\nMy focus is on whether there are intensifiers, comparatives, or the \"deadly from the start/outset\" idiom at play. \"HIGH ALERT\" is the interesting bit here. It signifies a heightened state of readiness. It describes a response to a potential risk, not the risk itself or its inherent severity.\n\nLet's check the patterns I'm looking for: An intensifier (like \"so\" or \"very\") modifying a risk-adjective (like \"deadly\" or \"dangerous\"). Nope. No intensifier there. Or a comparative (like \"more\" or \"deadlier\") modifying a risk-adjective? Again, no. And definitely not the \"deadly from the start/outset\" idiom.\n\nSince \"HIGH ALERT\" isn't a risk-adjective, and isn't being modified in the ways I'm looking for, it doesn't fit the criteria of Q1. The phrase describes a state of readiness, not the inherent nature of the outbreaks themselves.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\"\n"}
