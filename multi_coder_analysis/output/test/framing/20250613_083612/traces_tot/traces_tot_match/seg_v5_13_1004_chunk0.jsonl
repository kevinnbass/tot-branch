{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'deadly' is used factually to describe potential impact, not modified by an intensifier or comparative. Other negative outcomes are stated neutrally or are background conditions.", "method": "llm_batch"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('does not present', 'has the potential'). 'deadly' is an adjective checked by Q1. 'threatens to spark shortages' does not meet the specific pattern requirements for 'spark/stoke fears' which requires a fear/concern/panic word. 'soaring inflation' is background context.", "method": "llm_batch"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'threatens to spark' is a potential future impact, not a realised one, and falls outside Q3.", "method": "llm_batch"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a question.", "method": "llm_batch"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'does not present a food safety risk' is a bare negation, not using the word 'safe'.", "method": "llm_batch"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no minimiser or scale contrast pattern.", "method": "llm_batch"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the bare negation 'does not present a food safety risk' without an explicit calming cue about the broader situation.", "method": "llm_batch"}
