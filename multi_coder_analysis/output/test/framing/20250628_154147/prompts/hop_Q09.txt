### QUICK DECISION CHECK

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: Market prices for wheat decreased by 2% this month.
## Question: Is this factual reporting of prices/metrics using standard descriptive verbs?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"'decreased by 2%' reports price change factually without vivid verbs or risk adjectives."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: Market prices for wheat took a devastating 2% dive this month, spelling trouble.
## Question: Is this factual reporting of prices/metrics using standard descriptive verbs?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'devastating dive' and 'spelling trouble' add alarmist framing beyond neutral reporting."}

**Q9: Factual Reporting of Prices/Metrics**
Is the segment primarily reporting prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs (e.g., 'rose,' 'declined,' 'increased,' 'fell') and potentially neutral adverbs (e.g., 'sharply,' 'significantly') BUT WITHOUT employing vivid/potent verbs (e.g., 'skyrocketed,' 'plummeted'), risk adjectives (e.g., 'catastrophic losses'), or other explicit alarmist/reassuring framing language from the author/source, as detailed in the rules for economic language?
