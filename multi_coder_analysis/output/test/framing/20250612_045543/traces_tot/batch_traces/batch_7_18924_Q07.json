The negation alone is insufficient for Reassuring framing.\n\n\n\n**Key Principle:** A bare negation simply denies or downplays a risk/problem factually. To become Reassuring, it needs an additional linguistic layer that explicitly interprets this negation as a reason for calm or safety.\n\n**Examples:**\n* **Neutral (Bare Negation):** \"Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe.\"\n* **Reassuring (Bare Negation + Calming Cue):** \"Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe, meaning current health measures remain effective and there's no need for additional public concern.\"\n\n### Additional example\n* \"The cases **do not present an immediate public-health concern**.\" → Neutral (bare negation).\n\n**CLARIFICATION** – \"will **not** enter the food system\" and similar bare-negation\nstatements remain **Neutral** unless followed by an explicit calming cue\n(e.g., \"…so consumers can rest easy\").

  "thoughts": "**Applying Q7: Identifying Bare Negations in Context**\n\nAlright, I've got the task. The user wants me to go through these nine segments and determine if each one contains a \"bare negation\" according to the Q7 criteria. Specifically, I'm looking for statements that deny or downplay a risk or problem factually, *without* offering an explicit calming cue. I need to keep in mind the examples: phrases like \"not expected to cause problems\" or \"unlikely to affect X,\" and I also need to be sensitive to phrases that, while technically negations, aren't directly minimizing a risk – it's all about risk minimization, not just negations.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** This one immediately stood out. \"Human infection is *rare*...\" The word \"rare\" is classic risk downplaying. It's minimizing the likelihood of human infection, and there's no soothing phrase after it. This fits the Q7 definition. **Q7: Yes.**\n*   **Segment 2:** \"There is *no record* of Americans contracting...\" This is a clear case of negating the presence of something - there's no evidence of American contraction.  No calming language follows, so this meets the definition of a bare negation. **Q7: Yes.**\n*   **Segment 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9:** These all lack any negation words whatsoever. So, for these, it's a straightforward \"no.\" **Q7: No.**\n*   **Segment 6:** This one took a little more thought.  \"It was *not clear* how the bird flu virus found its way...\" This is a negation of understanding, not a direct negation of the risk itself. It doesn't downplay the *impact* or *presence* of the virus. So, I will treat this as not fitting the bare negation pattern I am looking for. **Q7: No.**\n*   **Segment 8:** \"...*does not present* a food safety risk...\" This directly negates a potential problem. It's essentially telling the reader that there's no risk to food safety, but with no explicit cue like, \"So you don't need to worry!\". Yes, this is a bare negation. **Q7: Yes.**\n\nIn the end, I've identified three segments (1, 2, and 8) as containing a \"bare negation\" according to Q7's definition. The others did not meet those criteria.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment\": 1,\n    \"q7\": \"yes\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": 2,\n    \"q7\": \"yes\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": 3,\n    \"q7\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": 4,\n    \"q7\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": 5,\n    \"q7\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": 6,\n    \"q7\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": 7,\n    \"q7\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": 8,\n    \"q7\": \"yes\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": 9,\n    \"q7\": \"no\"\n  }\n]\n```\n"
