(Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: \"The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%.\" (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).\n* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: \"Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds.\" (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').\n\n**Key Principle:** \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" \"plummeted\" can be potent verbs on their own (see Q2) if used dramatically. This rule specifically addresses their use when their alarmist nature is confirmed by accompanying details of scale/impact.\n\n**Boundary Requirements (clarified):**\n1. Verb **must appear in the approved list / regex**.  \n2. Must denote realised impact (not a plan or hypothetical).  \n3. Plain outcome verbs (*killed, died, affected, reported*) are excluded—Neutral unless other cues fire.\n\n**Examples of Scale/Impact Indicators:**\n- Numerical quantities: \"millions,\" \"thousands,\" \"50%,\" \"record numbers\"\n- Comparative terms: \"largest,\" \"highest,\" \"most severe,\" \"unprecedented\"\n- Impact descriptors: \"overwhelming,\" \"devastating losses,\" \"widespread damage\"\n\n> **New aspect guard.** The moderate-verb must denote **realised impact** – NOT merely an intention or hypothetical.  \n\n**Regex Pattern (tightened – comment shows exclusion):**\n```regex\n\\b(hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|\n     # ONLY active, realised culling counts\n     (?:were|was)\\s+culled|hitting)\\b\n(?=[^.]{0,40}\\b(?:\\d|million|millions|thousand|thousands|record|largest|unprecedented|severe|significant|overwhelming|devastating|disaster|disasters|emergency|emergencies)\\b)\n```\n# Passive/future forms (\"to be culled\", \"had to be culled\", \"planning to cull\")\n# fall through to Q8 (capability) or Q10 (speculative relief).\n\n**Clarification (v 2.16.2)** — Containment actions  \n\"Birds were *euthanized/depopulated* to prevent spread\" is **Neutral** unless paired with an explicit large-scale impact (e.g., \"euthanized ***millions*** of birds across 10 states\").\n\nIf the parser lemmatises verbs, **keep only the past-tense form** `culled`; exclude the lemma \"cull\" and its gerund unless explicitly preceded by a past-tense auxiliary (\"were/was culling\") that confirms an event already occurred.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` ",

  "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Segments**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with going through these ten segments and determining if they meet the criteria for Q3: a moderate verb paired with scale or impact information.  I've got my rules handy and I'm ready to roll.\n\nFor each segment, I carefully checked for verbs, especially those on the \"moderate verb\" list. Then, I looked closely for any accompanying scale or impact metrics.\n\nIn the first segment, I found nothing that fit. The second segment highlighted some figures (864 people, 456 deaths), but the verbs (\"contracted,\" \"resulting\") weren't on the list.  The third segment had a number (\"25,000 turkeys\"), but the verb (\"is responsible for\") wasn't a moderate one.\n\nSegment four was a tricky one. While \"cull\" does suggest an impact, the verb form, \"planning to cull,\" clearly indicates a future action. The rules specifically note that passive and future forms go to Q8 or Q10.\n\nFive and six yielded no suitable verbs, while seven was about preventative measures. Eight didn't fit, and in nine, although there were mentions of \"shortages\" and \"increase in prices\", the verbs were about potential future impacts.\n\nFinally, in ten, the scale (50 million birds) was significant, but the verbs used (\"killed,\" \"cost\") were explicitly excluded from this analysis.\n\nIn the end, after carefully examining each segment based on the criteria, I found that none of them met the requirements for Q3. So, I will format the output as an array.\n"
