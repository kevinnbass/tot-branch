AND is it distinguishable from a neutral, purely information-seeking question, as detailed in the rules?\n\n**🔍 Q4 Pattern Recognition Table:**\n| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |\n|------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Loaded Questions (Worry/Fear)** | \"Should consumers worry...?\" \"Are we facing a crisis?\" \"Is it safe to...?\" | ✓ |\n| **Loaded Questions (Inaction)** | \"Are we going to stand by while this unfolds?\" \"How long can we ignore this?\" | ✓ |\n| **Neutral Information-Seeking** | \"What are the safety protocols?\" \"When will results be available?\" | → Neutral |\n\n**🔗 See also:** Q1 for intensified language that may appear in questions; Q2 for potent metaphors in questions\n\n**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Alarmist.

Cues: 'system collapsing,' 'truly feel safe anymore?' - rhetorical question implying no).\n  * **Non-Example (Neutral):** Author: \"What are the safety protocols in place?\" (Information-seeking).\n* Use of loaded rhetorical questions by the quoted source or author that are designed to evoke fear, urgency, or strong concern by implying a severe problem or a dire lack of action.\n  * Example (Author-driven): 'How many more animals have to die before we finally act decisively?' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The rhetorical question uses emotive language 'have to die' and implies criticism of inaction, framing the situation as urgent and severe.)\n  * Example (Quote-driven): 'The activist asked, \"Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?\"' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The quoted rhetorical question uses 'disaster unfolds' to frame the situation alarmingly.)\n  * **Example (Rhetorical question from author implying worry):** Author: \"With new variants emerging rapidly, should humans be worried about the next pandemic?\" → Alarmist (if the context suggests this is not a simple information request but a way to frame emerging variants as a worrisome threat).\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – Loaded Q** | \"Should consumers be worried about buying eggs?\" | **Alarmist** | Loaded rhetorical question implying worry |\n\n**Regex Pattern:** `\\b(?:should|can|could|will)\\s+\\w+\\s+(?:be\\s+)?(?:worried|concerned)\\b`\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` ",

  "thoughts": "**Applying Q4: Rhetorical Question Assessment**\n\nOkay, I've got the task. The user wants me to run Q4 against ten different text segments. Q4 is all about identifying those sneaky rhetorical questions designed to crank up the alarm or inject a sense of urgency. My job is to meticulously comb through each segment, spot any questions, and then decide if they're loaded for emotional impact or just neutral information-seeking.\n\nLet's dive in:\n\n*   **seg\\_v5\\_11\\_1001\\_chunk0** through **seg\\_v5\\_14\\_1004\\_chunk0**:  I've reviewed each segment carefully.  No questions at all in the first segment. The second segment also had no questions, and the third segment, and the fourth segment.  The fifth segment didn't have any questions. The sixth segment stated, \"It was not clear how the bird flu virus found its way to the farms.\" which is not a question. The seventh segment. The eighth segment. The ninth segment. The tenth segment. All contained no rhetorical questions.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can confidently answer \"no\" for all ten segments. None of them contain a loaded rhetorical question intended to induce alarm or urgency.\n"
