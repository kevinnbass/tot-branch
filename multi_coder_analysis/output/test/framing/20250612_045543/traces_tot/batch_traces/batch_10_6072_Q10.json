The focus is on the *future possibility*, not a *present reassurance*.\n\n**Examples:**\n* **Neutral:** \"Experts predict that the supply chain issues could ease in the next quarter.\"\n* **Neutral:** \"There is hope that a new treatment may be available next year.\"\n* **Contrast with Reassuring:** If the statement was \"Because these measures are working, restrictions may be short-lived, bringing welcome relief soon,\" the \"because these measures are working\" part, if framed as active present control, might shift it towards Reassuring, depending on potency.\n\n**Critical Distinction:**\n- **Future-focused language alone** = Neutral speculation\n- **Future relief + present safety/control framing** = Potentially Reassuring\n- The key is whether current conditions are explicitly framed as providing present reassurance\n\n**Common Future-Oriented Language (Neutral unless paired with current reassurance):**\n- Modal verbs: \"may,\" \"might,\" \"could,\" \"should\"\n- Predictive language: \"expect to,\" \"predict,\" \"forecast,\" \"anticipate\"\n- Hopeful expressions: \"hope for,\" \"optimistic about,\" \"looking forward to\"\n- Timeline indicators: \"next quarter,\" \"soon,\" \"in the coming months,\" \"eventually\"\n\n**Boundary Analysis:**\nThe segment must speculate about *future* improvement or relief. If it describes *current* positive conditions or *present* safety, it may fall under different rules (Q5-Q6 for reassuring, Q7-Q9 for neutral factual reporting).\n\n**Regex Pattern:** `\\b(may be|could|might|expect.{1,15}improve|predict.{1,15}ease|hope.{1,15}better)\\b`\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` ",

  "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Segments**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to analyze these two segments using the Q10 criteria, which focuses on identifying speculation about future relief or improvement without explicit calming language about the present. This is a pretty straightforward application of our understanding of rhetorical patterns and emotional framing.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n*   **Segment 1: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\"**  Hmm, this one seems pretty clear-cut. It's simply reporting a fact about an event. There's no hint of looking forward to improvement or relief. No, it doesn't speculate about the future. And no, there aren't any explicit attempts to soothe the reader about the current situation. Q10 is a \"no\" for this one.\n\n*   **Segment 2: \"The chief veterinarian for Lublin province, Pawel Piotrowski, confirmed that the deadly H5N8 virus was responsible for the turkey deaths in two farms in the village of Stary Uscimow, which lies 45 kilometers (28 miles) from the borders with Ukraine and Belarus. It was not clear how the bird flu virus found its way to the farms.\"** This segment is similar.  Again, it presents information about past and present events, specifically the confirmation of the virus and the location of the farms. It is not future-oriented, nor does it contain any calming cues. Thus, Q10 is a \"no\" here as well.\n\nTherefore, for both segments, my answer to Q10 is \"no\". And I'll return the results as a JSON array as requested.\n"
