### QUICK DECISION CHECK
• Sentence is a QUESTION starting with **SHOULD / CAN / COULD / WILL / WHAT IF / HOW LONG** **AND** includes **WORRIED / CONCERNED / AFRAID / IGNORE / STAND BY**?  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.
• Regex now pre-catches **"Is it safe to …?"** and **"How many more … have to die?"** rhetorical questions; you can ignore those.

### Question Q4
**Q4: Loaded Rhetorical Question for Alarm**
Does the author or a quoted source pose a loaded rhetorical question that is clearly designed to imply an Alarmist frame, instill fear/urgency, or suggest a worrisome threat (e.g., 'Should consumers worry...?', 'Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?') AND is it distinguishable from a neutral, purely information-seeking question, as detailed in the rules?

**🔍 Q4 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
<!-- Q4.1 -->
| **Loaded Questions (Worry/Fear)** | "Should consumers worry...?" "Are we facing a crisis?" "Is it safe to...?" | ✓ |
<!-- Q4.2 -->
| **Loaded Questions (Inaction)** | "Are we going to stand by while this unfolds?" "How long can we ignore this?" | ✓ |
| **Neutral Information-Seeking** | "What are the safety protocols?" "When will results be available?" | → Neutral |

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Alarmist. No → Proceed to Q5.

**‼ Precedence with Q5** – If the question sentence also contains a *calming keyword* ("safe", "under control", "alarm"), Q5 wins (Reassuring) and Q4 returns **"no"**.

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Examples:**
* **Example (Author-driven, implying worry):** Author: "With new variants emerging rapidly, should humans be worried about the next pandemic?" → Alarmist (if context suggests framing a worrisome threat).
* **Example (Quote-driven, implying disaster):** 'The activist asked, "Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?"' → Alarmist.
* **Critical Distinction:** Carefully distinguish these from neutral, purely information-seeking questions (which are Neutral).

**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**
* Direct questions from the author that use explicitly loaded or emotionally charged language clearly designed to imply an Alarmist frame or instill fear/urgency in the reader.
  * **Example:** **Author:** "With the system collapsing, can anyone truly feel safe anymore?" (Alarmist. Cues: 'system collapsing,' 'truly feel safe anymore?' - rhetorical question implying no).
  * **Non-Example (Neutral):** Author: "What are the safety protocols in place?" (Information-seeking).
* Use of loaded rhetorical questions by the quoted source or author that are designed to evoke fear, urgency, or strong concern by implying a severe problem or a dire lack of action.
  * Example (Author-driven): 'How many more animals have to die before we finally act decisively?' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The rhetorical question uses emotive language 'have to die' and implies criticism of inaction, framing the situation as urgent and severe.)
  * Example (Quote-driven): 'The activist asked, "Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?"' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The quoted rhetorical question uses 'disaster unfolds' to frame the situation alarmingly.)
  * **Example (Rhetorical question from author implying worry):** Author: "With new variants emerging rapidly, should humans be worried about the next pandemic?" → Alarmist (if the context suggests this is not a simple information request but a way to frame emerging variants as a worrisome threat).

**Few-Shot Exemplars:**
