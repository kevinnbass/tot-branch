{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' modifies the risk-adjectives 'infectious' and 'deadly'.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment**\n\nI need to determine if the given text segment triggers the \"Alarmist\" frame based on the decision tree. My first step is to evaluate it against Q1, which looks for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. Scanning the text, I immediately identify \"so infectious\" and \"so deadly.\"  Both phrases follow the pattern of \"intensifier + risk-adjective,\" with \"so\" acting as the intensifier and \"infectious\" and \"deadly\" being the risk-adjectives. Since any single match suffices according to the rules, the answer to Q1 is definitively \"yes.\"  Therefore, the rationale must reflect this crucial finding: \"The text contains 'so infectious and deadly,' fitting the 'intensifier + risk-adjective' pattern.\""}
