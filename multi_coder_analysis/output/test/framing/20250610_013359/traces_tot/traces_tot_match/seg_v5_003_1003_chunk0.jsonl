{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective. It describes a factual event (limited purchases due to an outbreak) without using amplified language.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Intensified or Comparative Risk Adjectives (Q1)**\n\nOkay, here's my assessment of the given text segment, acting as an expert claim-framing coder. The goal is to identify if there's an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective, which is what the decision tree's Q1 asks for.\n\nThe segment is, \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nImmediately, I scan for the target pattern: an intensifier or comparative adjective paired with a risk-adjective. I'm looking for the specific keywords defined in the rules: *intensifiers* like 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely,' etc., and *comparatives* like 'more,' 'less,' 'deadlier,' etc., followed by *risk-adjectives* such as 'deadly,' 'dangerous,' or 'severe.'\n\nReading the segment, it becomes apparent that the pattern simply isn't present. There are no intensifiers or comparatives modifying any adjectives. While the text refers to an \"outbreak,\" implying some level of risk, \"outbreak\" functions as a noun, not an adjective. Therefore, I can confidently answer \"no\" to Q1. The segment lacks the key structure needed to pass this initial step."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language like 'limited' and 'outbreak' without high-potency verbs or potent metaphors.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment against Decision Tree Question Q2**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this text snippet against Question Q2 of the decision tree. My task is to determine if the segment uses high-potency verbs or potent metaphors that are actively framing the situation in an alarming way. I need to be on the lookout for language that amplifies the negative aspects beyond a neutral presentation of the facts.\n\nLet's see, the segment is: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nRight off the bat, I need to scan for those \"red flag\" words or phrases listed in the Q2 criteria.  The verbs here are \"limited\" and \"due to.\" The nouns are: \"buyers\", \"China\", \"Korea\", \"poultry purchases\", \"Indiana\", \"outbreak\", \"commercial turkey farm\".  I'm not seeing anything that jumps out at me as intentionally alarming.\n\n\"Limited\" is pretty neutral. It simply describes an action taken by the buyers, and \"due to\" is a standard causal connector.  \"Outbreak\" is a factual term that describes the situation, but it doesn't try to sensationalize the event.  The segment describes a negative consequence, but it does it without being overly dramatic.  There's no \"ravaged,\" no \"devastated,\" no \"ticking time bomb.\" This is pretty much just a straight reporting of the facts.\n\nSo, the answer to Q2 is definitely \"no.\" We're not dealing with any exaggerated or fear-inducing language here.  I'll need to move on to the next question in the decision tree, but since the prompt only requested my answer for Q2, that's where I'll stop."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a moderate verb from the specified list paired with explicit scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Decision: Evaluating for Moderate Verbs and Significant Scale**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to determine if it aligns with Q3 of our claim framing decision tree. That means I'm checking for two things: a \"moderate verb\" and \"significant scale or impact information.\"\n\nThe sentence is: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nFirst, I scanned for those moderate verbs we defined: things like \"swept across,\" \"plummeted,\" or \"hit.\"  Hmm, I see \"limited,\" which is a verb, but it's not on my list.  \"Outbreak\" is there, but that's a noun.\n\nNext, I looked for scale or impact information: phrases like \"millions culled,\" \"record losses,\" or mentions of percentages or costs.  The text does mention an \"outbreak at a commercial turkey farm.\" However, I don't see anything explicitly quantifying the impact in a way that fits the criteria. It’s more of a descriptive factual account.\n\nSince the segment doesn't contain a moderate verb paired with explicit scale/impact information, my answer to Q3 is **no**. I'm ready to move on, but I'll stick to this answer for now, as that is all I'm prompted for."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no questions, therefore no loaded rhetorical questions.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" My task is to evaluate this against Q4, specifically looking for loaded rhetorical questions designed to spark alarm.\n\nFirst, I had to thoroughly *analyze* the segment. It's a straightforward factual report of a situation – international buyers curtailing purchases because of a poultry outbreak. No hidden agenda, no dramatic framing, just the facts.\n\nNext, I *reviewed Q4* itself. It's looking for questions that are *designed* to be emotionally manipulative, using examples like \"Are we simply going to stand by?\" versus neutral, information-seeking questions.  The key is the *loaded* nature of the question, the intent to create fear or urgency.\n\nThen, the critical step: *comparing* the segment against Q4.  There aren't *any* questions in the segment!  It's just a statement.  Therefore, by Q4's definition, the segment doesn't meet the criteria at all.\n\nThis leads me to the obvious conclusion. The answer is a clear \"no.\" And, the *rationale* is equally clear: the segment contains zero questions.  Therefore, it is impossible for it to contain loaded rhetorical questions implying alarm.\n\nFinally, I'll formulate this all neatly into a JSON object."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports factual events (limited purchases due to an outbreak) but contains no explicit language from the author or a source designed to calm concerns or assure safety.", "thoughts": "**Q5 Evaluation: Absence of Explicit Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess this text snippet – \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there\" – against Q5. This means I need to look for any explicitly reassuring language, anything that's designed to calm concerns or minimize the perceived risk.\n\nI'm reading this and thinking, \"Hm, it's pretty straightforward.\" It's a factual statement about a situation: an outbreak happened, and buyers responded by limiting purchases. There's nothing in here like \"everything is fine,\" \"don't worry,\" or \"the risk is minimal.\" No phrases to suggest that things are under control or that the situation is being managed in a way that minimizes potential harm. It just states the facts, however negative those facts might be.\n\nSo, according to my understanding of Q5 and the explicit calming cues we're looking for, I have to conclude that **this segment doesn't contain any**."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser ('only', 'just') combined with an explicit scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'nationwide').", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Minimizer + Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I'm evaluating this text snippet against Q6 of the decision tree, looking for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern used for reassurance. The snippet reads: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nMy task is to identify a minimizer (like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely\") coupled with an explicit scale contrast (e.g., \"out of thousands,\" \"among millions\").  After a close look, I don't see either. There are no minimizers present, and no scale contrast. I noted that while \"a\" is present, it's not being used in a minimizing capacity as I'd expect. So, I'll answer \"no\" to this question and move on to Q7, as the pattern is absent."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes actions taken ('limited poultry purchases') due to an event ('an outbreak') and does not contain any bare negation pattern.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and the task is to determine if it's a \"bare negation\" according to the decision tree, specifically Q7. That means I need to identify if there's a negation, like \"no\", \"not,\" etc., *without* any kind of calming cue.\n\nThe text reads, \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" Hmm, let me break this down. It clearly describes a situation: buyers restricted purchases. The reason is explicitly stated as an outbreak. My radar is up for negation terms - \"no,\" \"not,\" \"unlikely,\" etc. - followed by phrases about risk, problems, or impact.\n\nI'm not seeing any of that. The language is direct. It states actions taken (\"limited purchases\") and their cause (\"due to an outbreak\"). There's no negation of a problem or downplaying of the risk. It's a factual statement of events and their cause.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q7 is \"no.\" This segment does not contain a bare negation. It's just a straightforward description of events and their underlying cause. Since the prompt only asks for Q7, I don't need to consider proceeding to Q8. I'm ready to move on."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a past event (outbreak) and its consequence (limited purchases), not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Question Q8**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" My task is to determine if this segment is a \"Capability/Preparedness Statement without Active Reassurance\" based on Question Q8.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Q8 is looking for. It wants to know if the segment describes *capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards* without actively reassuring the reader that everything is currently calm or safe. The key is that these actions or statements can be related to hopeful possibilities of what could be in the future, if a plan is successful, or if certain measures are taken.\n\nI start by mentally scanning the segment for keywords related to capability and preparedness, like \"officials,\" \"vaccine,\" \"system,\" \"plan,\" \"protocol,\" \"measure,\" \"safeguard,\" \"capability,\" \"prepare,\" \"develop,\" \"implement,\" \"work,\" and \"contain.\" Immediately, I notice none of these terms are present. The segment simply states that buyers limited purchases due to an outbreak. It describes an effect of a situation: the reaction to an outbreak in the market.\n\nMy analysis quickly shows that the segment reports on a negative event (the outbreak) and its consequence. There are no descriptions of actions taken, systems, capabilities, or preparedness. Thus, the text segment *does not* include the kind of content that Question Q8 is looking for.\n\nI'm confident the segment doesn't fit the premise of Q8 because it is an account of a negative situation and a related consequence. It doesn't describe any actions or future possibilities around capabilities/preparedness. Because it lacks the *type* of content Q8 is interested in, I can't classify it as a \"Capability/Preparedness Statement without Active Reassurance,\" even if the reassurance aspects aren't explicitly mentioned. The premise of the question is simply not present. Therefore, my answer is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'limited poultry purchases' reports an economic action factually without vivid verbs or risk adjectives.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of the Text Segment Against Q9**\n\nAlright, I've got the text segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" My task is to evaluate this against Q9 of the decision tree, which asks if the segment reports prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs and potentially neutral adverbs, *without* vivid/potent verbs, risk adjectives, or explicit framing.\n\nFirst, I break down the segment.  It's about *buyers* limiting *purchases* of poultry from Indiana *because* of an outbreak. It's related to economic activity (purchases), but it doesn't immediately strike me as reporting a *specific* price change or a numerical metric in the way Q9 is designed to identify (like \"prices rose,\" etc.).\n\nHowever, it *does* mention \"poultry purchases,\" which is economic data, essentially. The action described is \"limited purchases.\" Is \"limited\" a standard descriptive verb in the context of economic reporting?  I'm thinking about the examples in the table – \"rose,\" \"declined,\" \"increased,\" \"fell,\" etc.  \"Limited\" isn't explicitly there, but it *describes* an action taken that *affects* an economic metric (poultry purchases). It's essentially saying these purchases were *reduced*.\n\nThe segment doesn't use any vivid or alarmist language. It's just a factual statement about a consequence of an outbreak. There's no \"skyrocketing,\" no \"plummeting,\" and no \"catastrophic losses.\"  It's just reporting.\n\nNow, I have to weigh whether \"limited poultry purchases\" fits the spirit of Q9, which is about *neutral* reporting of economic changes.  The phrase is factual, and the verb \"limited\" could be interpreted as a standard descriptive verb in this context. It's similar to saying \"poultry purchases decreased.\"\n\nIf I consider the intent of Q9 – to catch neutral economic reporting – this seems to fit. It's a factual report about an economic event.  It's not amplified in any way.\n\nSo, I will conclude that \"limited poultry purchases\" is reporting economic data using a standard descriptive verb in a factual manner. I'll interpret \"limited\" as functioning similarly to \"reduced\" or \"decreased\" in this context.  I'm going with a \"yes\" to Q9, leading to a Neutral frame. The decisive cue is \"limited poultry purchases.\"\n\nI'll be ready to move to the next question."}
