{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment for Claim Framing (Q1)**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this text snippet against the first question of our 12-step decision tree for claim framing. Specifically, Q1 wants me to look for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. I'm sharp enough to know the kind of phrases we're looking for here: \"so deadly,\" \"very dangerous,\" \"more severe,\" that sort of thing.\n\nThe text in question is: \"On Tuesday, Kentucky officials expect final test results for a separate suspected outbreak among turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky.\"\n\nLet's break it down: \"On Tuesday\" and \"Kentucky officials expect final test results\" are pretty neutral.  Now, the phrase \"for a separate suspected outbreak\" is interesting.  We *do* have a negative term, \"outbreak,\" but the modifier is \"suspected,\" and that's not what Q1 is after.  \"Suspected\" isn't a direct intensifier, nor is it a comparative word.  \"Outbreak\" itself isn't a risk adjective as defined by Q1. It's more of a general problem. The rest of the sentence is just location information.\n\nSo, according to Q1, are there any of those patterns, like \"so deadly\" or \"more severe\" present? No. I can confidently say the answer to Q1 is \"no.\" This means I'll need to explain the rationale (although the prompt is just asking for the answer). And of course, in the proper JSON format, I'll provide the 'no' answer and the full rationale. Time to move on to Q2."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('expect final test results', 'suspected outbreak') and contains no high-potency verbs or potent metaphors.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"On Tuesday, Kentucky officials expect final test results for a separate suspected outbreak among turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky.\" The task is to analyze it against Question Q2 of that 12-step decision tree. That question, as I understand it, is looking for alarmist language, high-potency verbs, or potent metaphors that are actively framing the situation in an alarming way.\n\nMy immediate thought is to scan for those \"red flag\" words. I see \"expect,\" and while that's not exactly neutral, it's certainly not a verb that *amplifies* anything. It just states an anticipation of an event. Then I see \"suspected outbreak.\" \"Outbreak\" itself is potentially negative, but the addition of \"suspected\" significantly tempers the impact. The context, \"expect final test results,\" further grounds the language in a procedural, factual manner. It's about data and the process of investigation, not about panic or alarm.\n\nI don't see any vivid language like \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" \"skyrocketed,\" or any metaphorical bombs, ticking or otherwise. This is a straightforward reporting of an ongoing investigation. In my expert opinion, the language is factual and neutral.\n\nTherefore, Q2 gets a resounding \"no\" from me. The text doesn't actively frame the situation alarmingly. It's simply reporting on a potential issue and the ongoing investigation."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the verb 'expect' which is not a listed 'moderate verb', and it does not include explicit scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Deconstructing the Text: Q3 Application**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and asked to evaluate it against Q3 of this decision tree. Right, Q3 looks for that specific combination: a \"moderate verb\" *and* some \"significant scale or impact\" information. My initial read of this is, let's see if the text trips either of these.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the segment: \"On Tuesday, Kentucky officials expect final test results for a separate suspected outbreak among turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky.\" Alright, I've got \"expect\" as a potential verb to check.\n\nNow, I flip back to the Q3 \"moderate verb\" list. Hmm, it includes things like \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" and \"plummeted.\"  \"Expect\" isn't there. So that's the first hurdle, crossed with a \"no\".\n\nNext, I need to look for any significant scale or impact. The text mentions an \"outbreak among turkeys in Webster County.\" Okay, location and animal type... but is that significant impact?  It's missing those key indicators from the Q3 requirements, specific numbers, percentages, or those alarmist terms.\n\nTherefore, since the segment doesn't have the elements Q3 looks for, it's a clear \"no\" on this one. It's a straight-forward application. I have my answer."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain any question, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to evaluate this snippet of text against Q4 of that decision tree.  Q4, if I recall correctly, is all about spotting those loaded rhetorical questions designed to spark alarm.  The segment is: \"On Tuesday, Kentucky officials expect final test results for a separate suspected outbreak among turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky.\"  Let me break this down.\n\nIt's a straightforward statement, really. It just states an expectation regarding test results. There's no hint of a question, let alone a rhetorical one that's trying to imply anything negative or alarming.  It's just the facts, as I see it. It is nothing more than information. I am not seeing anything that would suggest it meets Q4's criteria.\n\nSo, the answer to Q4 is clearly a \"no\". I'll format my response as requested."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a factual expectation about test results for a suspected outbreak but contains no explicit calming language or intensified low-risk evaluation.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Reassuring Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"On Tuesday, Kentucky officials expect final test results for a separate suspected outbreak among turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky,\" with Q5 in mind. Q5 wants me to spot any explicit calming language â€“ anything that's trying to reassure the reader, like saying \"don't worry,\" or highlighting positive aspects to downplay the potential risk.\n\nAnalyzing the segment, it's pretty straightforward. It's just a factual statement about when to expect test results for a potential outbreak. No attempt at minimizing the risk or emphasizing safety. It mentions a \"suspected outbreak\" but that's just neutral language. There are no classic \"calming\" phrases in sight.\n\nSo, according to my evaluation, the answer for Q5 is a definitive **no**. Now, I can move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions a 'suspected outbreak' but contains no minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) or scale contrast ('out of X') to frame it reassuringly.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Reassurance: Q6 Criteria**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this text segment to see if it triggers that Q6 reassurance flag. The user wants to know if the segment employs a \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" combo. Let's see...\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the segment: \"On Tuesday, Kentucky officials expect final test results for a separate suspected outbreak among turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky.\" Alright, got it. Now, does this contain any minimizing language? I'm looking for words like 'only,' 'just,' 'merely,' something that downplays the significance. Nope, nothing like that here. Next, I need to check for a scale contrast. Is there a number or event being framed against a larger context, implying a smaller problem? No, not that either.\n\nSo, Q6 demands *both* of those elements. Since I'm not seeing *either* a minimizer *or* a contrasting scale being used, I have to conclude that this segment fails the Q6 test. The answer is definitively \"no.\"\n\nI'll output this as a JSON object with the \"no\" answer and a clear rationale for the decision."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any bare negation or statement of absence.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and my job is to assess it according to Q7. That means I need to quickly identify if there's a \"bare negation\" present, meaning a negative statement without any context that would make it more acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to read the segment: \"On Tuesday, Kentucky officials expect final test results for a separate suspected outbreak among turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky.\" Alright, a pretty straightforward sentence describing an expectation.\n\nNext, I scan for those telltale negative words or phrases. I'm looking for \"no\", \"not\", \"unlikely\", or anything that denies the existence of something. But, I don't see any of those kinds of terms. It's all about expectation and suspicion, not negation.\n\nNow for the judgment: Does this segment *contain* a bare negation? Clearly, it does not. The information describes a *suspected* outbreak, which inherently *expects* some form of confirmation. It's simply stating that they *expect* results, not *expect* a negative result. No negation detected!\n\nSo, in the context of Q7, my answer is \"no\". And according to the logic tree, that means I'm moving on to Q8. This is the correct interpretation, and the analysis is sound."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Describes officials' action ('expect final test results') related to investigating a potential issue, without explicit reassurance.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Neutral Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment and asked to assess it against question Q8 of the decision tree. Q8 is looking for whether the text describes capabilities, preparedness measures, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards *without* explicitly linking them to current calm, safety, or minimized risk.  In other words, does it talk about things being *done* to address a situation, but without saying \"it's okay, you're safe now\"?\n\nThe segment is: \"On Tuesday, Kentucky officials expect final test results for a separate suspected outbreak among turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky.\"  Let's break it down:\n\n*   **\"Kentucky officials expect final test results...\"**:  This highlights an action â€“ the officials are in the process of getting information. It's about ongoing investigation and monitoring.\n*   **Is this a capability, preparedness measure, etc.?**: Definitely. This is part of the process of containing or understanding a potential issue, fitting within the framework of \"officials are working on this\" or \"surveillance is in place.\"  The Q8 table gives examples, and this feels like it falls in line with that.\n*   **Does it reassure?**: Nope. There's no language that implies \"this means you're safe,\" or \"risk is low.\" It's just a statement of a fact-finding step.\n\nBased on Q8's rules and examples, this fits the bill. The segment describes an action the officials are taking to investigate a potential issue, but it does *not* offer any explicit reassurance. It's a capability/preparedness action without the reassurance, which, according to the table, means I should answer \"yes\" to Q8 and assign a Neutral frame.\n\nThe keyword is definitely \"officials expect final test results.\" It's an action being taken to manage a potential issue, and that's the tell. This fits the Neutral categorization."}
