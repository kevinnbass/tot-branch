{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective. Proceeding to Q2.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Q1 - No Intensifiers or Comparatives**\n\nOkay, here's how I see this: the text segment, \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast,\" doesn't trigger Q1. I'm looking for a clear intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. Think \"very dangerous,\" \"more severe,\" or something along those lines.\n\nWhen I break it down, I see no such patterns. \"Wild birds\" is a neutral descriptor. \"Thought to be spreading\" isn't vivid enough, it's just a passive statement. \"The virus\" is, well, the virus, neutral in this context. \"After dozens tested positive\" reports the scope, but \"tested positive\" is a factual statement of state/results, and \"dozens\" is a quantitative measure - not an *intensifier* that amplifies the degree of the risk. Likewise, \"U.S. East Coast\" is just a location.\n\nThere's no \"very deadly,\" no \"more dangerous.\" Therefore, Q1 is a \"no.\" I'll now proceed to Q2, although I haven't needed to evaluate it yet."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verbs 'spreading' and 'tested positive' are moderate and do not meet the criteria for high-potency verbs or potent metaphors.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of the Text Segment for Alarming Framing**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with this text snippet: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\" My task is to analyze it according to the Q2 of the decision tree. That means I need to look for any high-potency verbs or potent metaphors that are actively trying to frame the situation in an alarming way.\n\nFirst, I broke down the segment, focusing on the verbs and key nouns. \"Spreading\" is the most prominent verb, and while it definitely describes transmission, it's not a high-potency verb that would immediately trigger alarm bells. Think \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" or \"skyrocketed\" - those are the kinds of verbs I'm looking for here, and \"spreading\" doesn't fit that profile. \"Tested positive\" is a straightforward, factual statement. \"Dozens\" sets the scale, but it's directly linked to the testing, not a heightened emotional trigger. The other elements like \"virus,\" \"wild birds,\" and \"U.S. East Coast\" are just the necessary components of the sentence.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I have to conclude that Q2 is \"no\". There are no high-potency verbs or potent metaphors present that actively frame the situation alarmingly. I'll need to move on to the next question in the decision tree, Q3, to continue my analysis."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a moderate verb from the specified list paired with significant scale or impact information. 'dozens' is not considered significant scale in this context.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Decision Tree Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text, \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast,\" and I need to evaluate it against Q3 of the decision tree. Q3 is all about identifying whether we have a 'moderate verb' paired with 'significant scale or impact information.' My first step is to break this down.\n\nFirst, I scanned the text for any verbs that could be considered 'moderate verbs' based on the given list: 'swept across,' 'hard hit,' 'soared,' 'plummeted', 'hit', 'surged', 'plunged', 'prompted', 'culled'.  I quickly noticed \"spreading\" and \"tested positive.\"  However, neither \"spreading\" nor \"tested positive\" are on *that* list. So, that's one strike.\n\nNext, I need to check if there's any significant scale or impact information, *even if* a moderate verb were present. The text states \"dozens tested positive.\"  While \"dozens\" is a quantity, it doesn't quite jump out as \"significant scale or impact\" considering the examples provided in the guidelines, like \"millions culled,\" \"record losses,\" or a \"50% increase.\" \"Dozens\" just feels... smaller.\n\nPutting it all together, I have to ask: do I see a moderate verb *from the list* paired with significant scale/impact?  The answer is no.  There's no moderate verb from the list, and the scale mentioned (\"dozens\") doesn't feel significant enough.\n\nSo, for Q3, the answer is a resounding \"no.\"  I'll need to prepare a JSON output with the rationale: the segment doesn't contain the pattern of a moderate verb from the list paired with significant scale/impact."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain a question, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\"  My task is to evaluate this within the context of the decision tree, specifically Q4. Q4, as I understand it, is looking for those loaded rhetorical questions designed to spark alarm.\n\nFirst, I need to identify if there's even a question present. Taking a closer look, it's immediately clear that this is a declarative statement, not a question at all. It's simply relaying information.\n\nSince Q4 is specifically focused on questions, and this segment doesn't contain one, I can confidently answer \"no.\" My rationale will need to clearly state that the segment does not, in fact, contain any form of question, eliminating the possibility of a loaded rhetorical question. This is a straightforward application of the decision criteria."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports negative facts (virus spread, positive tests) but contains no explicit calming language or intensified low-risk evaluation.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and tasked with checking it against Question 5. That's the one about spotting explicit calming language, things like \"no need to worry\" or \"everything's under control.\"  \n\nThe text talks about wild birds spreading a virus and mentions positive test results.  Straight away, that's not exactly sunshine and rainbows.  It's reporting something potentially negative: a virus spreading and confirming cases. Now, my job is to see if they've snuck in any attempts to soothe the audience. I re-read the text carefully, looking for those specific phrases. I'm scanning for any subtle attempts to downplay the situation, maybe some \"don't panic\" type wording.  But, nope, there's nothing. No reassurances, no effort to tell everyone to relax.  So, based on the criteria in Q5, the answer is a clear \"no.\" There's simply no calming language present."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'dozens' but lacks a minimiser ('only', 'just') and an explicit scale contrast ('out of X') to frame it reassuringly.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of Reassurance through Minimization and Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with analyzing this text snippet, \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast,\" against Q6 of my decision tree. That question, as I understand it, is looking for a specific pattern: \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" used to provide reassurance.  Essentially, is the language trying to make a potentially concerning fact sound less serious by framing it within a smaller-than-expected scope?\n\nMy initial read is that the text doesn't hit that mark. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I looked for a minimizer, words like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely\" that would downplay the number.  \"Dozens\" is used, but that's a *quantity*. It describes a count of birds. While \"dozens\" isn't a large number in an abstract sense, it isn't used here as a qualifier to minimize a scale like the words I mentioned.\n\nThen, I scanned for a contrasting scale. A phrase like \"out of thousands\" or \"in a population of millions\" that would put those \"dozens\" into a larger context. I found \"along the U.S. East Coast\" and I'll be honest, it's not enough to be considered a contrast. It's just a geographical location.\n\nFinally, I considered whether the combination of the language was *intended* to reassure. The text doesn't seem to be minimizing in a way that should be reassuring. It clearly states that birds are spreading the virus and that there are dozens of positives in a specific area. \"Dozens\" isn't being framed as a small number in this context.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is \"no.\" This segment does not exhibit the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern for reassurance that Q6 is looking for. We can move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any bare negation cues like 'no', 'not', 'unlikely', etc.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment Against Q7**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with a text snippet and I need to assess whether it contains a \"bare negation\" according to the criteria of Q7. That means looking for negative phrasing *without* a calming cue.\n\nThe text reads: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\"\n\nMy expert eye immediately scans for negation. I'm looking for words like \"not,\" \"no,\" \"unlikely,\" or phrases like \"didn't happen.\"  I also keep an eye out for any obvious mitigating language that would act as a calming cue.\n\nAfter a thorough examination, it's clear: there are *no* negative words present. The sentence describes a situation – birds spreading a virus – but it doesn't negate anything or offer any calming reassurance.\n\nTherefore, applying my expertise and understanding of the prompt, I can definitively state that the answer to Q7 is \"no.\" This means I should proceed to the next question, but since I'm only being asked about Q7, I need to generate the appropriate JSON response for this specific query."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the source and impact of virus spread, not capabilities, preparedness, safeguards, or hopeful future possibilities.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment against Question Q8**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. The user wants me to evaluate the segment: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast\" against Question Q8 of the decision tree. Q8 is specifically looking for descriptions of capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards *without* explicitly connecting them to present safety or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is to break down the segment.  We have \"wild birds...spreading the virus\" – that's a negative, describing a potential spread mechanism. Then we have \"dozens tested positive\" which is clearly also a negative outcome. Nothing about these two parts suggests *capabilities* or *preparedness* as defined by Q8.\n\nI have to carefully consider what Q8 is looking for. It *specifically* asks if the segment describes those positive elements.  I scan the segment again.  No mention of officials working, vaccines, systems, plans, or containment efforts.  Definitely no hopeful future possibilities tied to our current safety.\n\nThe segment describes a *problem* (spread and cases), not a solution or positive preventative measure. My understanding, based on the question, is that it's *not* asking about negative situations, but about positive ones. It's looking for optimistic, forward-looking statements.\n\nThe \"Bedrock Principle\" and \"Symmetry Rule\" come to mind here. Since the text describes negative things, I expect this to be coded Neutral later on, but that's not my concern *right now*.  I must follow the decision tree and only answer Q8.\n\nMy conclusion is clear: the segment doesn't fit Q8's criteria.  The segment doesn't meet the *first* part of Q8's condition, the requirement for *describing* those positive elements. Since it fails to describe capabilities, preparedness, etc., the entire question fails. It doesn't describe the items Q8 is looking for at all.\n\nI've even reviewed the Q8 Pattern Recognition Table and Detailed Rules to double-check. The segment doesn't match any of the patterns listed there.\n\nTherefore, my answer is \"no\". This segment is a negative statement describing a spread event and its consequences. It doesn't describe any capabilities, preparedness, safeguards, or hopeful possibilities as Q8 is defined. The rationale is equally straightforward."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is not reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics as described by Q9.", "thoughts": "**Q9 Evaluation - My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\"  My task is to determine if this aligns with Q9, which focuses on factual reporting of prices or numerical metrics using standard verbs.  Essentially, is this about reporting prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics like costs, profits, etc., and doing so with the kind of verbs Q9 is looking for?\n\nHmmm, this seems pretty straightforward. The segment is discussing wild birds spreading a virus and mentions \"dozens\" testing positive.  While \"dozens\" is a numerical quantity, it's not being used in the context of prices, economic data, or any of the types of metrics Q9 is concerned with. We aren't discussing costs going up or down, profits being made or lost, or any financial figures. It's more of a scientific or medical report.\n\nTherefore, this segment *does not* meet the criteria for Q9. My answer to Q9 must be \"no\".  And because it's a \"no,\" I'll move on to the next step, Q10."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a current suspected mechanism of spread and past test results; it does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q10**\n\nOkay, I'm given a text segment: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\" and asked to evaluate it against Q10 of the decision tree. Q10 is looking for speculation about future relief or improvement *without* an explicit calming cue about the current state.\n\nFirst, I break down the segment. \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus\" describes a current mechanism. Then, \"after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast\" relays a past event that supports the aforementioned current mechanism.\n\nNow, does this sound like it's speculating about future relief? Let's go through the checklist. There's no hint of future easing. I see no modals like \"may\" or \"could\" in a relief context. No predictive terms or optimistic expressions are present. There's no mention of a timeframe either.\n\nBased on my understanding of the segment, it only discusses a current and past situation. It's focused on describing the *mechanism of spread* and supportive evidence of that spread. It's not speculating about the future at all. The entire segment is concerned with the present or past.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q10 is \"no.\"  The segment lacks any language suggesting future improvement or resolution. I can clearly see why this would be the case and it is now ready to move onto the next stage."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any direct quotations or attributed statements from a specific source.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a short segment: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\"  My task, as I understand it, is to assess this against Q11, which concerns itself with dominant frames established *through direct quotations*.\n\nFirst, I need to *scrutinize* the segment. Immediately, I see there are *no* direct quotes present. No \"...\" marks, no attributed statements. This makes the answer a clear-cut case.\n\nQ11 is specifically looking for a *quoted* source that's framing the narrative. Since there *aren't* any quotations, it's impossible for a *quoted* source to be establishing a dominant frame.\n\nTherefore, the answer is unequivocally \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the text segment doesn't contain any direct quotations. I'll construct the JSON object accordingly, providing the 'no' answer and the brief explanation."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports negative facts (virus spread, positive tests) using factual, neutral language ('thought to be spreading', 'dozens tested positive') without explicit framing cues.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: The Text is Neutral**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to analyze this segment – \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast\" – through the lens of Q12 in our 12-step claim framing process. Specifically, I'm checking if it defaults to a *Neutral* frame because it lacks explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues.\n\nI immediately start by systematically searching for those high-priority cues. First, I scan for the usual Alarmist suspects (Q1-Q3): intensifiers, vivid verbs depicting impact, and exaggerated scales or loaded metaphors. Nothing. \"Spreading\" is a standard verb, not a dramatic one. \"Tested positive\" is pure factual reporting. The phrase isn't designed to evoke alarm.\n\nNext, I check for Reassuring cues (Q4), explicit attempts to calm the reader. Again, nothing. No \"don't worry,\" no \"under control\" language.\n\nNow, with those high-priority framing cues absent, I lean into the Neutral criteria. This feels like a classic \"Default\" scenario (Q6) because the segment focuses on factual reporting. It directly aligns with the Q12 examples: we have \"factual descriptions of phenomena,\" \"factual reporting,\" and a neutral metric (\"dozens\"). The use of the epistemic modal \"thought to be\" adds some nuance, acknowledging uncertainty, but it's not paired with any framing that amplifies the potential threat.\n\nThe segment reports a negative fact – virus spread and positive tests – but it does so without resorting to alarmist language. It's a plain statement of a potentially concerning situation.  The fact that it is a factual presentation leads to the conclusion that this is a neutral frame and I would answer yes to Q12. It's the \"Severe Fact, Neutral Presentation\" scenario detailed in the rules. Therefore, I'm confidently calling this *Neutral*."}
