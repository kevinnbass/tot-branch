{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the phrase 'highly lethal', which is an intensifier ('highly') modifying a risk-adjective ('lethal').", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"They [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\"  My task is to apply Q1 of the decision tree to this segment. Q1, as I understand it, looks for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nI immediately spot the phrase \"highly lethal bird flu.\"  I know \"highly\" is an intensifier, and \"lethal\" clearly functions as a risk-adjective, signifying something deadly.  This perfectly fits the pattern we're looking for: `Intensifier + Risk-Adjective`.  Specifically, it's a direct match to examples like \"highly lethal.\"\n\nSince the segment contains the pattern specified by Q1, my conclusion is that the answer to Q1 is definitively \"yes.\"  The decisive cue here is, without a doubt, \"highly lethal\".  And, based on my understanding of the Precedence Ladder, a \"yes\" to Q1 automatically classifies the frame as Alarmist, which means I needn't proceed further down the decision tree.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment contains the phrase \\\"highly lethal,\\\" which matches the pattern `Intensifier + Risk-Adjective` as defined in Q1.  The decisive cue is \\\"highly lethal\\\".\"\n}\n```"}
