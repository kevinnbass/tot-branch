{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a factual outcome (deaths) but does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, let me take a look at this. The user wants me to assess this text snippet against the first question in the decision tree: does it contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective? They've provided a segment: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\"\n\nMy approach is straightforward. First, I need to identify any risk-adjectives from the established list: 'deadly,' 'dangerous,' 'severe,' 'catastrophic,' 'brutal,' 'contagious,' 'virulent,' and 'destructive'. Then, I'll scan the segment to see if any of these are preceded by an intensifier or comparative like 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely,' 'highly,' 'frighteningly,' 'particularly,' 'more,' 'less,' 'deadlier,' 'safer,' 'higher,' or 'lower.'\n\nImmediately, I see that the segment focuses on the *outcome* of the bird flu outbreak – the deaths of turkeys. Neither \"bird flu\" nor \"deaths\" qualify as risk-adjectives. The number \"25,000\" refers to the scale of the impact, not a description of the disease's inherent risk.\n\nI've carefully reviewed the entire text, and I can confidently say that there's no instance of an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective. The segment simply states a factual event. Therefore, my answer to Q1 is \"no.\" I'll format the response as JSON as requested."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses factual language ('say', 'is responsible for', 'deaths') and numbers ('at least 25,000 turkeys') without high-potency verbs or potent metaphors.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment: Q2 Evaluation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and need to assess it based on Q2 of this decision tree. Q2 is all about spotting alarmist language – specifically, high-potency verbs or potent metaphors.  Essentially, am I seeing anything that's trying to frame this situation in a particularly negative or dramatic way?\n\nLooking at the segment, I'm breaking down the language.  \"Authorities say\" – that's just a reporting verb. Neutral. \"Is responsible for the deaths\" – again, pretty straightforward and causal. It's stating a fact.  \"Deaths\" – that's the outcome, the fact. And \"at least 25,000 turkeys\" - that's a number, a factual description of the scale.\n\nNone of these elements jump out at me as intentionally trying to amp up the emotion.  There's no \"ravaged\" or \"devastated.\"  No \"time bomb\" or \"nightmare scenario\" type metaphors. The language is factual and descriptive.  Bird flu caused these deaths, and here's the number.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is clear: This segment *does not* contain a high-potency verb or a potent metaphor.  My answer to Q2 is definitely \"no\".  Now, I need to format that into the required JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment lacks high-potency verbs or potent metaphors. The language is factual and descriptive, using neutral reporting verbs and factual nouns/phrases to communicate the cause and outcome of the situation.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a negative fact ('deaths') and its scale ('at least 25,000 turkeys') but does not use one of the specified 'moderate verbs' from the Q3 list to describe the event.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys...\" and my task is to determine if it meets the criteria of Q3 in a framing analysis decision tree. Q3, as I understand it, is looking for a \"moderate verb\" coupled with significant scale or impact information, where that verb denotes *realized* impact, not intention.\n\nLet's dissect this. The segment describes bird flu causing the deaths of turkeys, which is indeed an event with clear scale: \"at least 25,000 turkeys.\"  The verb phrase is \"is responsible for the deaths of,\" which effectively means \"caused\" or \"killed.\" But the list of approved \"moderate verbs\" for Q3 doesn't include \"caused\" or \"killed.\" It lists verbs like \"hit,\" \"swept,\" \"surged,\" \"plummeted,\" etc.  I can't find *any* of those verbs in the segment. The regex confirms this: it's designed to flag those specific verbs, and it comes up empty.\n\nEven though \"at least 25,000 turkeys\" *is* significant impact information, the *key* requirement – the moderate verb – is missing. The rule is clear: *both* conditions must be met.  The verb has to be one of the listed verbs in order for Q3 to apply. Because the first condition, the presence of a \"moderate verb,\" is not satisfied, I have to conclude that Q3 does *not* apply.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q3 is \"no.\" My rationale focuses on the absence of a moderate verb from the defined list, even though the segment describes a negative event with clear scale. The framing analysis decision tree dictates I move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement reporting facts and does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Loaded Rhetoric**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and asked to apply a specific rule from the decision tree—Q4, which targets loaded rhetorical questions that create a sense of alarm. My initial approach is to immediately scan the text for any question marks, as that's the obvious starting point.\n\nThe text reads: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\" Right away, I see this is a straightforward declarative sentence reporting a factual situation. There isn't a single question mark in sight, which is the first, and quite definitive, indicator that we're dealing with a \"no\" for Q4.\n\nHowever, I need to go a step deeper. Even without a direct question, the text could potentially *imply* an alarm through its structure or word choice. I carefully consider the phrasing. The information provided is about a large number of turkey deaths due to bird flu. This information is designed to inform the public of the situation. It doesn't use emotionally charged language. The language used is purely factual. It conveys the information without trying to manipulate the reader's emotions.\n\nTherefore, after thoroughly analyzing the text, I can confidently answer \"no\" to Q4. The segment does not contain any loaded rhetorical questions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The text segment is a declarative statement reporting a factual situation. It does not contain any questions, nor does it employ rhetorical devices to imply alarm or urgency.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (turkey deaths from bird flu) but contains no explicit calming language from the authorities or author.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Absence of Explicit Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with this text snippet: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\" My task is to assess whether it contains any explicit calming cues, as defined by Question Q5.\n\nFirst, I break down the text. It's reporting a negative event – a large-scale bird flu outbreak causing significant turkey deaths. The source of the information is identified as \"Authorities\".\n\nNow, I look at Q5. The crucial element here is the presence of language *explicitly* communicating current safety, control, or significantly minimized present risk. Think phrases like \"no cause for alarm\", \"fully under control\", or statements downplaying the risk, like saying it's \"very low\" or that the public should \"rest easy.\"\n\nComparing the text to Q5, the problem is pretty clear. The text provides a straightforward, factual report. It doesn't offer any reassurances, minimize the risk for humans, or state the situation is under control. It simply states the facts: the bird flu, the deaths, and the location.\n\nTherefore, the answer is a clear \"no.\" The segment lacks the *explicit* calming language Q5 is looking for. It's a news report, not a reassuring public health announcement. My rationale is the text's neutral presentation of a negative event, devoid of any phrases that explicitly frame the situation as safe or controlled for the public. I'd represent this in a JSON object with \"no\" as the answer and the lack of explicitly calming language as the supporting justification."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a large number ('at least 25,000') and lacks both a minimiser ('only', 'just') and a scale contrast ('out of thousands') required for this rule.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Reassuring Minimisers & Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I need to check this text snippet against Question 6 of the decision tree, specifically looking for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern used for reassurance. Let's see...\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the segment, which is: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\"\n\nNext, I'll scan for a *minimiser*. I'm looking for words like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" etc. Hmm... \"at least 25,000\" seems like a significant number; it's *not* being minimized. No minimiser words present.\n\nNow, on to the *scale contrast*. I'm expecting something like \"out of millions\" or \"nationwide\" to put the 25,000 into perspective. While the text specifies a location (\"near the country's borders\"), it doesn't provide the wider context needed for scale contrast.\n\nGiven that Question 6 requires *both* a minimiser and a scale contrast to be present and working together to convey reassurance, and neither element is found here, the answer to Q6 is definitely \"no\".\n\nTherefore, the JSON object will look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment does not contain the required combination of a minimiser and a scale contrast.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes deaths but contains no 'bare negation' phrases like 'not expected', 'unlikely', or 'no cases'.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Bare Negation in the Text Segment**\n\nAlright, I've got the text segment: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\" My task is to determine if this segment triggers Question 7 of the decision tree, which hinges on the presence of a \"bare negation\" lacking a reassuring context.\n\nI've carefully scanned the text, and I'm looking for specific negation patterns, like \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no cases,\" or similar phrases that imply something *isn't* happening or *won't* happen. I'm also mindful of the absence of explicit calming cues that might follow, which would influence the final answer.\n\nThe segment clearly describes a negative outcome: a large number of turkey deaths due to bird flu. However, the text doesn't explicitly state what *isn't* the case or what *won't* occur. It's a straightforward statement of a negative fact. There are no instances of the targeted negation patterns.\n\nTherefore, since I haven't detected any of the predefined \"bare negation\" phrases, and the text doesn't convey any negation pattern in this sense, the answer to Question 7 is definitively \"no.\" It's a simple, factual statement about the deaths, but it doesn't contain a negative frame that would trigger the Q7 rule. I'll proceed accordingly, knowing that I'm now ready to proceed to the next question in the decision tree (Q8)."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a past event (deaths) and its cause, but does not describe capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q8**\n\nOkay, here's my assessment. The user has given me this text segment: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\" My task is to evaluate this against Question Q8 of the 12-step decision tree. Specifically, I'm checking if this segment describes capabilities, preparedness, hopeful future possibilities, or implemented safeguards, *without* framing them with active reassurance.\n\nBased on the question's premise, I'm looking for language related to those specific elements. I need to spot words or phrases that suggest abilities, plans, resources, improvements on the horizon, or actions taken to protect. After a close read, I see the text only reports a factual occurrence: the deaths of turkeys and the attributed cause, bird flu.\n\nMy thinking is that the segment does *not* contain any of the content that Q8 is looking for. It doesn't discuss any capabilities of the authorities, any preparation they have in place, any future improvements, or any safeguards they've implemented. The mention of \"Authorities\" doesn't describe *what* they are doing. This is purely factual reporting about an event.\n\nTherefore, since the segment lacks the specific subject matter Q8 is concerned with, the question itself doesn't apply. I cannot answer \"yes\" because there is nothing in the text to evaluate against the second part of the question.  The initial condition of the question is not satisfied.\n\nLogically, I should answer \"no\" to Q8 and move to the next question, Q9. This aligns with the decision tree logic: if a question's condition is not met, the answer is \"no\".\n\nTo be extra certain, I double-checked the Q8 rule and examples. The rule is clear: it's looking for specific types of content, then checking for active reassurance framing *of that content*.  The segment simply doesn't contain any of the elements listed in the Q8 table. There is no language of development, response, preparedness, or future possibilities. It's a plain statement of fact.\n\nSo, in conclusion, my answer to Q8 is definitively \"no\" because the segment fails to contain any of the content that the question is designed to assess. My response will reflect this reasoning."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a death count, not prices, economic data, or financial metrics using standard descriptive verbs like 'rose' or 'declined'.", "thoughts": "**Q9 Analysis: Bird Flu Deaths Report**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text snippet, and the prompt wants me to evaluate it against Q9.  I know Q9 is all about spotting when a piece is using standard verbs to report prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics.  My initial thought is to figure out whether the text describes economic data or a similar metric.\n\nThe segment says, \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys...\"  My main focus is on the numerical information, \"25,000 turkeys.\" This *is* a numerical count, but the wording is about the *deaths* related to a bird flu event.\n\nNow, Q9 is concerned with language that *reports economic data* and changes in that data (e.g., prices).  The text doesn't use standard financial verbs like \"rose,\" \"declined,\" \"increased,\" or \"fell.\"  It doesn't include any vivid or alarming language about the number, either.\n\nThe core of Q9 is related to how price information or financial data is presented. My immediate impression is that this particular number - the number of deaths - is not the *economic data* type the question is looking for.\n\nI'm checking the specific rules. Does it fit the pattern Q9 describes? The pattern is *economic* or *price* reporting using the verbs mentioned. \"Deaths of\" isn't one of those verbs. It's reporting a consequence of an event, which is the death toll. So, while it's a number, and it's factual, it's not the same kind of data Q9 targets.\n\nLet's carefully revisit Q9. I need to make sure I've addressed *every* aspect. The text has a numerical metric, but *it's not* the kind of metric (prices, economic data). The verbs used are not the kinds of verbs that describe changes (rose, fell, etc.). It lacks any alarmist language.\n\nMy conclusion is that this segment *doesn't* meet Q9's criteria.  The segment reports a factual death toll and does not fall within the guidelines of reporting economic data with the corresponding verb types. It isn't the type of economic analysis that Q9 targets. So, the answer to Q9 is \"no.\"  I'm ready to move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a past event (deaths of turkeys) and does not contain speculation about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment against Decision Tree Question Q10**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and need to determine if it meets the criteria outlined in Q10 of this decision tree. Q10 is looking for speculation about future relief or improvement *without* an explicit calming cue about the present. My task is to ascertain if the segment hints at some positive shift on the horizon.\n\nLet's dive in: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\"\n\nRight away, this is a report of a past event: the deaths of turkeys, attributed to bird flu. This segment details a negative situation that has *already* transpired. There's no language of uncertainty about the future, no mention of possible mitigation, or a projected time frame for things to get better. I'm not seeing any cues like \"may lessen,\" \"could see an upturn,\" or \"expect stabilization.\" It's just a straightforward statement of fact.\n\nBased on my understanding of Q10, a \"yes\" answer means a \"Neutral\" frame. Since the segment doesn't speculate about future relief or improvement, my answer is \"no.\" This means I need to move on to the next question in the decision tree, Q11. My analysis is that the current segment does not speculate about future relief or improvement, which dictates a \"no\" response. This is clearly a case of reporting what *has* happened, not predicting what *will* happen."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment attributes information to 'Authorities' but does not contain a direct quotation with explicit framing language.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for a Directly Quoted Alarmist or Reassuring Frame**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\" My task is to determine if this segment triggers Q11 of my decision tree, specifically if it contains a *directly quoted source* delivering a dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame.\n\nMy first step is always to scan for those telltale quotation marks. They're the key to unlocking this particular decision point. Here, I see the attribution to \"Authorities in eastern Poland,\" but there are no actual direct quotes used. It's a statement of fact, reported by a source, not a direct quote of that source's words.\n\nSince there are no direct quotes to analyze, I can immediately conclude that Q11 is a \"no\" for this segment. I don't need to delve into analyzing potential frames because there aren't any frames *from a direct quote*. I can confidently move on to the next question in my process."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Severe fact (deaths) reported factually without explicit alarmist or reassuring framing language.", "thoughts": "**Q12 Analysis: Neutral Framing Confirmed**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to apply the Q12 rule to this text segment. My primary task here is to determine if, after considering all the previous framing rules (Q1-Q11), the presentation of the information leans towards alarmism or reassurance, or if it remains neutral.\n\nThe provided segment, \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus,\" presents a clear fact: a significant number of turkey deaths are attributed to bird flu. My immediate focus is to analyze the language used.\n\nI'm checking for alarmist cues first. I'm looking for intensifiers, exaggerated scale descriptions, and loaded metaphors that might amplify the impact. The phrase \"deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys\" certainly describes a severe situation. However, the use of \"at least\" is a standard quantifier, not necessarily an alarmist framing device in this context. It's a precise statement, not an exaggeration. The number itself is significant, yes, but the *presentation* of the number is factual. There are no vivid verbs like \"decimated\" or \"wiped out\" to heighten the emotional impact.\n\nNext, I look for reassuring cues. I need to see if there's any explicit language designed to calm concerns or minimize the perceived risk. Phrases like \"no need to worry\" or \"under control\" are what I'm looking for. There are none.\n\nIn light of this, it's clear the text defaults to the Q12 rule, the \"default-to-neutral\" rule. The severe fact, the large number of deaths, is presented factually. There's no framing, alarmist or reassuring, employed. This makes Q12 a \"yes\" answer. I consider the text to be neutral."}
