{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains the risk-adjective 'deadly' but it is not modified by an intensifier or comparative adjective as required by Q1.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Segment for Claim Framing (Q1)**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants me to assess a text segment against the first question of a decision tree for claim framing. Specifically, I need to check if the segment contains an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.  I've been given a list of risk-adjectives and intensifiers/comparatives, and a clear pattern to look for: `(intensifier|comparative)\\s+(risk-adjective)`.\n\nI've carefully read the segment, \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation,\" keeping that pattern in mind.\n\nInitially, I see phrases like \"food safety risk,\" which uses a risk word, but it's not being modified by an intensifier or comparative.  Next, I noticed \"deadly to domestic fowl.\"  \"Deadly\" *is* a risk-adjective, no question. However, it's not preceded by any of those intensifiers or comparatives I'm looking for. It's preceded by \"being,\" which is part of the verb phrase \"potential of being.\"\n\nI moved through the rest of the text, \"threatens to spark shortages\" and \"further increase in prices.\" While these describe negative outcomes, they don't involve a risk-adjective.  \"Further\" modifies \"increase\", not a risk adjective, and the context guard for vivid language applies to \"soaring inflation.\" I need to ignore descriptions of background conditions like that.\n\nAfter a thorough scan, I must conclude that the pattern I'm looking for, `(intensifier|comparative)\\s+(risk-adjective)`, is not present in the segment. Specifically, \"deadly\" appears, but it lacks the necessary intensifier or comparative.  Therefore, my answer for Q1 is \"no.\" I haven't found the specific construction that the question is asking me to identify.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verbs 'threatens to spark' are not listed as high-potency verbs in Q2. 'soaring' modifies 'inflation', which is a background condition explicitly excluded by the Q2 context guard.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment for Q2**\n\nMy initial task was to assess the provided text segment against the criteria outlined in Q2 of the decision tree. Q2 is specifically concerned with identifying alarmist language, looking for elements like high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert\" near a threat word.\n\nI carefully dissected the segment: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\"\n\nFirst, I identified potential negative facts and impacts, such as the potential for the virus being deadly to fowl and the possibility of shortages and increased prices. However, my focus had to remain on the *language* used to describe these potential impacts.\n\nThe crucial parts were \"threatens to spark\" and \"amid soaring inflation.\"  I referenced the provided list of high-potency verbs for Q2, which included examples like \"ravaged,\" \"skyrocketed,\" and \"crippling.\"  \"Threatens to spark\" did not appear on that list. While it suggests a negative outcome is *possible*, the verb itself doesn't carry the same level of intensity or urgency as the listed examples.  It's a moderate verb indicating potential, rather than a strong assertion of harm.\n\nRegarding \"soaring inflation,\" the decision tree explicitly states that \"amid **soaring inflation**\" is considered a contextual background condition, and should be ignored for Alarmist coding, in accordance with the context guard.\n\nTherefore, since the text does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert\" that meet the specific criteria outlined in Q2, my answer must be \"no.\"\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'threatens to spark' which is a future/hypothetical verb, not denoting realised impact. 'Soaring' describes background inflation, not the virus's direct impact on cases/deaths/culling.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Decision: No Alarmist Cue**\n\nOkay, I've got this. My task is to evaluate this text segment and see if it triggers the \"Alarmist\" flag in Q3 of our decision tree.  I'm looking for a moderate verb paired with significant scale or impact.\n\nFirst, I identified the relevant section of text. Then, I scanned it for the moderate verbs we've defined, like \"hit,\" \"surged,\" or \"feared.\" I found a few: \"threatens to spark,\" \"increase,\" and \"soaring.\"\n\nNow, the tricky part. \"Threatens to spark\" sounds like it's *hypothetical* and future-oriented, which the rule says is a no-go for Q3. These future-focused verbs are actually for Q8 and Q10 and aren't about *realized impact*, which is what Q3 needs. \"Increase\" is a neutral verb, not on the list. \n\nAs for \"soaring,\" that's on the list, but it's used to describe *inflation*, which is a background condition. The rule is specific here: vivid language describing a background condition doesn't trigger an Alarmist cue. We're looking for vivid language about the virus's direct *impact*. Even if we considered \"soaring\" to describe the virus's impact on prices, it is still not a past-tense verb denoting *realized* impact.\n\nI did see potential impact mentioned in the text: shortages and an increase in prices. But that doesn't matter because the verbs describing them are not moderate verbs that apply *realized impact*.\n\nTherefore, I have to conclude that none of the verbs meet the Q3 criteria for a moderate verb denoting *realised impact* paired with scale/impact. The answer to Q3 is definitely \"no\".\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Provided Text**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and my job is to analyze it according to question Q4, which focuses on loaded rhetorical questions designed to induce alarm. My expert intuition is immediately engaged.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the passage. Reading it quickly, I see it's about a virus and its impact on food safety and supply chains. It highlights potential negative consequences: harm to poultry, shortages, and price increases. That's the basic gist.\n\nNow, Q4: it's looking specifically for *rhetorical questions*. I'm thinking, \"Does the author try to inject fear by asking questions, knowing the audience is already worried?\" My training kicks in. I need to be *meticulous*.\n\nI go back to the text, this time laser-focused on question marks and phrases that subtly function as questions. Scanning, scanning... nope. It's all declarative. Statements, not questions. There's nothing like, \"Are we doomed?\" or \"Won't someone think of the children?\"\n\nThe text *describes* potential problems, but doesn't *ask* about them in a way that implies alarm or urgency. It's a risk assessment, not a panic-inducer.\n\nTherefore, applying my expert knowledge of rhetorical devices and persuasive language, my conclusion is clear: the text does *not* contain a loaded rhetorical question. The answer to Q4 is unequivocally \"no.\" This calls for a clear JSON output outlining my rationale.\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'does not present a food safety risk' states a conditional positive fact but lacks explicit calming language or intensified low-risk framing required for Q5.", "thoughts": "**Q5 Decision: Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I've got it. The user wants me to assess a text segment against Question 5 of the decision tree, which is looking for *explicit calming cues* about safety, control, or risk minimization. My initial thoughts are that I'm looking for language that goes beyond simple statements of fact; I need to see active reassurance. I'm focusing on phrases like \"no cause for alarm,\" \"rest assured,\" or intensified low-risk statements.\n\nNow, let's break down this segment: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\"\n\nMy primary focus here is that phrase: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked.\" On its face, it *is* a positive statement - it asserts no food safety risk under specific conditions. But here's the crucial part: does it meet the *explicit* calming criteria of Q5? The Q5 definition and examples are really clear on this point. I'm not seeing the explicit calming language that the question calls for. I'm looking for more than a straightforward statement.\n\nEssentially, \"does not present a food safety risk\" is a bare negation/positive fact combination without explicit calming amplification. We're not seeing phrases like \"excellent news,\" \"we're confident,\" or even a qualified link to safety from an official source. It's a conditional statement, not an active reassurance. It's like saying \"this isn't *that* bad,\" rather than actively stating \"it is safe\".\n\nThe rest of the segment dives into potential negative consequences - dead poultry, shortages, price hikes. That further strengthens my view that this part doesn't contain an explicit calming cue. I see an emphasis on potential threats, not on reassuring statements of safety and control.\n\nTherefore, because the phrase \"does not present a food safety risk\" doesn't include the explicit calming language required by Q5, I have to conclude that the answer is \"no.\" This is not an explicit calming cue based on the decision rules.\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text does not contain the required 'minimiser + scale contrast' pattern (e.g., 'only one out of thousands') to trigger Q6.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for the Q6 Pattern: No Minimizer, No Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and need to determine if it aligns with Q6 of the decision tree. Q6, as I understand it, is looking for a specific rhetorical pattern: a \"minimizer\" coupled with an explicit \"scale contrast\" that would, in effect, downplay a potential negative.  I'm looking for language like \"only\" or \"just\" *along with* something that gives a large-scale perspective, like \"out of millions\" or \"nationwide\".\n\nFirst, I scrutinized the text: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\"  I carefully searched for the telltale signs.\n\nNext, I looked for the minimizers. I was specifically on the lookout for words like \"only\", \"just\", \"merely\", or quantifiers that suggest a limited scope like \"a single\" or \"a few.\"  Unfortunately, these weren't present.\n\nThen I shifted my focus to the scale contrasts. I looked for phrases that would establish a broader context, something like \"out of thousands of cases\" or \"nationwide concern.\"  No such phrases were in sight, either.\n\nThe rule, of course, requires *both* elements: a minimizer *and* a scale contrast, working in concert to reassure.  Since neither is present in this text, Q6 doesn't apply. I'm going to have to conclude that the answer is \"no.\"  I'll need to formulate a clear rationale, explaining that the specific pattern (minimizer + scale contrast) that Q6 identifies is absent from the text.\n"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'does not present a food safety risk' is a bare negation without an explicit calming cue.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment Regarding Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\" My task is to determine if this contains a \"bare negation\" (a negative statement about risk) without any explicit calming cues, following Q7 rules.\n\nFirst, I identified the negation: \"does not present a food safety risk.\" This clearly qualifies as a \"Risk Negation.\" Now, I need to check for any calming cues that might follow, but I see \"as long as food is properly cooked.\" That's a conditional statement, not a reassurance. It doesn't tell the consumer to *not* worry or that there's nothing to fear, it only states a condition in order to avoid the risk mentioned.\n\nReviewing Q7, the rule specifies that risk negations are Neutral unless they are paired with explicit calming language. This segment has a risk negation but no reassuring or calming cues. Therefore, the answer to Q7 is definitely \"yes,\" and according to the rules, the frame will be Neutral.\n\nHere's the JSON output I'd generate:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment includes the phrase \\\"does not present a food safety risk,\\\" which is a Risk Negation. Since there is no accompanying explicit calming cue, the answer to Q7 is 'yes'.\"\n}\n```\n"}
