The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)\n\n**Clarification on \"deadly,\" \"fatal,\" \"lethal\":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist.

  "thoughts": "**Applying Q1: Intensifiers, Comparatives, and \"Deadly from the Start\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with applying Question 1 (Q1) to these ten text segments. Q1 focuses on identifying the presence of intensifiers or comparative adjectives that directly modify risk-adjectives, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\". My expertise allows me to quickly zero in on potential red flags, considering the nuances of language and context.\n\nHere's how I approached each segment:\n\n*   **Segments 1-5:** In these segments, the language describes the situation, but lacks the necessary intensification or the fixed idiom to trigger Q1. \"Rare\" and factual descriptions are not the target. Actions taken, like blocking access, don't themselves imply intensified threat.\n*   **Segment 6:** While the text mentions \"deadly H5N8 virus,\" this is a factual description of the virus itself, not an intensified descriptor.  \"Deadly\" used descriptively does not trigger the rule, but it is a good indicator to watch out for.\n*   **Segment 7:** Similar to the earlier segments, the descriptions of \"sick birds\" and \"unusual bird deaths\" are factual statements about the situation, not intensified characterizations of the threat.\n*   **Segment 8:** \"Very low\" is present, but \"low\" is a low-risk adjective and \"very\" is an intensifier, which actually indicates a reassuring (Q4) statement.\n*   **Segment 9:** This segment presents a few interesting points. The use of \"deadly to domestic fowl\" is factual, not intensified.  While \"threatens to spark\" is a concerning phrase, the vivid verbs listed in Q2 are not present. \"Soaring inflation\" is a background condition, not a direct measure of the threat being described, and is therefore ignored in this analysis.\n*   **Segment 10:** The segment gives factual information about the impact of the virus (\"killed 50 million birds\"). These are metrics, not intensified language.\n\nIn all ten segments, the application of Q1 resulted in a \"no\" for each. I will now output the JSON array with the segment IDs, answers, and rationales as specified. The key lies in understanding that Q1 specifically looks for intensified language directly modifying a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom, and not the mere mention of risk. Context is very important.\n"
