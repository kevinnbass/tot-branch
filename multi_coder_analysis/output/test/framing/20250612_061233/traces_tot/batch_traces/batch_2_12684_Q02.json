Context and the 'Principle of Cue Sufficiency' are key.)**\n\n**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**\n* Authorial use of vivid, active verbs or metaphors to describe the spread or impact of a threat, especially when combined with its scale or severity, thereby emphasizing its uncontrolled, rapid, or overwhelming nature. Example: Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)\n\n**Alarmist - Examples:**\n* \"The economic impact of the subject on the agricultural sector is a ticking time-bomb for food security,\" said the analyst. (Alarmist → The analyst's quote uses a potent metaphor \"ticking time-bomb,\" framing the economic impact with fear/urgency.)\n* Author: \"Political inaction is steering us towards a catastrophic crisis related to the subject.\" (Alarmist → Author's framing of political aspect through loaded language like \"catastrophic crisis,\" assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Author-driven, vivid metaphor & intensifier):**\n  * Author: \"The virus is a raging inferno, tearing through populations with terrifying speed, leaving devastation in its wake.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses vivid metaphor 'raging inferno,' 'tearing through,' 'terrifying speed,' and 'devastation in its wake.' Decisive cues: 'raging inferno,' 'terrifying speed'.\"\n* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: \"The disease ravaged poultry flocks across three states, leading to immense economic losses.\" (Alarmist → 'Ravaged' + 'across three states' + 'immense economic losses' create a strong alarmist frame).\n* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: \"Confirmed cases soared past one million, overwhelming healthcare systems.\" (Alarmist → 'Soared past one million' + 'overwhelming healthcare systems' creates a strong alarmist frame).\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – High-potency verb** | \"An outbreak ravaged farms across three states.\" | **Alarmist** | \"ravaged\" (vivid, destructive verb) |\n| **Alarmist – Superlative-negative-noun** | \"The H5N1 wave is now considered the most expensive animal-health disaster in U.S. history.\" | **Alarmist** | \"most expensive...disaster\" (superlative + negative noun) |\n| **Alarmist – Critical alert phrase** | \"State authorities remain on high alert for new cases.\" | **Alarmist** | \"on high alert\" (critical alert phrase) |\n\n**Boundary guard:** If the verb is \"hit / hitting / swept / surged\" but the segment gives no numbers, adjectives or metaphors that convey magnitude, treat it as Neutral.

  "thoughts": "**Q2 Assessment: A Thorough Analysis of Ten Text Segments**\n\nMy task was to carefully analyze ten text segments, each representing a distinct piece of information. The goal? To determine if any of these segments contained specific linguistic cues that trigger Q2 analysis. These cues are my usual indicators of emotionally charged or potentially misleading language that needs further scrutiny. I was looking for:\n\n*   High-potency verbs: Words like \"ravaged,\" \"skyrocketed,\" or \"crippling,\" which convey strong emotional impact.\n*   Potent metaphors: Figurative language that paints a vivid, potentially alarming picture.\n*   Superlative + negative nouns: Phrases like \"the worst nightmare\" that combine extreme adjectives with negative concepts.\n*   \"On high alert\" plus a threat word: This combination suggests heightened concern and potential danger.\n\nI systematically reviewed each segment, scrutinizing the language used. I paid close attention to verbs, looking for those that packed an emotional punch. I also considered the presence of metaphors and looked for superlative adjectives paired with negative nouns. Finally, I kept an eye out for the phrase \"on high alert\" in conjunction with any threatening terminology.\n\nAfter a meticulous review of all ten segments, my conclusion is clear: none of them contain the specific cues necessary to trigger Q2 analysis. There were no high-potency verbs, impactful metaphors, or the targeted superlative-negative noun combinations. While some segments contained potentially alarming information (e.g., about bird flu outbreaks), the language itself did not meet the specific criteria for Q2. Therefore, for all ten segments, the answer is \"no.\" This means I do not need to apply Q2 analysis to any of these segments.\n"
