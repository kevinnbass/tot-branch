The negation alone is insufficient for Reassuring framing.\n\n\n\n**Key Principle:** A bare negation simply denies or downplays a risk/problem factually. To become Reassuring, it needs an additional linguistic layer that explicitly interprets this negation as a reason for calm or safety.\n\n**Examples:**\n* **Neutral (Bare Negation):** \"Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe.\"\n* **Reassuring (Bare Negation + Calming Cue):** \"Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe, meaning current health measures remain effective and there's no need for additional public concern.\"\n\n### Additional example\n* \"The cases **do not present an immediate public-health concern**.\" → Neutral (bare negation).\n\n**CLARIFICATION** – \"will **not** enter the food system\" and similar bare-negation\nstatements remain **Neutral** unless followed by an explicit calming cue\n(e.g., \"…so consumers can rest easy\").

  "thoughts": "**My Assessment of 'Bare Negations' for Q7**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of the nine segments based on Q7's criteria. The goal is to identify if a segment contains a \"bare negation\" regarding a risk or problem – essentially, a statement that downplays or denies the risk without explicitly reassuring the audience.\n\nIn **Segment 1**, the phrase \"Human infection is *rare*\" is a clear instance of downplaying risk, and there's no additional language to provide reassurance. So, *Yes* to Q7.\n\n**Segment 2** presents an \"evidence negation\" with \"There is *no record* of Americans contracting...\" without offering comfort to the audience. Therefore, it's also a *Yes*.\n\n**Segments 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9** are straightforward – no negation or risk-downplaying language at all, leading to a *No* for Q7.\n\nIn **Segment 6**, the phrase \"It was *not clear*\" negates knowledge of how the virus spread, but *doesn't* directly address the risk itself. Based on the examples and the focus on the risk statement's characteristics, I'm going with *No*.\n\nFinally, **Segment 8** contains \"The virus *does not present a food safety risk*,\" which clearly negates a potential problem. Though it offers a condition, it *doesn't* offer explicit comforting language. Thus, it's a *Yes* to Q7.\n\nSo, in summary, the Q7 answers are:\n\n*   Segment 1: Yes\n*   Segment 2: Yes\n*   Segment 3: No\n*   Segment 4: No\n*   Segment 5: No\n*   Segment 6: No\n*   Segment 7: No\n*   Segment 8: Yes\n*   Segment 9: No\n"
