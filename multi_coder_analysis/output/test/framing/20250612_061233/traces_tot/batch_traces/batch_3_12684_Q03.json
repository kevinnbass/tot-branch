(Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: \"The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%.\" (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).\n* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: \"Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds.\" (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').\n\n**Key Principle:** \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" \"plummeted\" can be potent verbs on their own (see Q2) if used dramatically. This rule specifically addresses their use when their alarmist nature is confirmed by accompanying details of scale/impact.\n\n**Boundary Requirements (clarified):**\n1. Verb **must appear in the approved list / regex**.  \n2. Must denote realised impact (not a plan or hypothetical).  \n3. Plain outcome verbs (*killed, died, affected, reported*) are excluded—Neutral unless other cues fire.\n\n**Examples of Scale/Impact Indicators:**\n- Numerical quantities: \"millions,\" \"thousands,\" \"50%,\" \"record numbers\"\n- Comparative terms: \"largest,\" \"highest,\" \"most severe,\" \"unprecedented\"\n- Impact descriptors: \"overwhelming,\" \"devastating losses,\" \"widespread damage\"\n\n> **New aspect guard.** The moderate-verb must denote **realised impact** – NOT merely an intention or hypothetical.  \n\n**Regex Pattern (tightened – comment shows exclusion):**\n```regex\n\\b(hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|\n     # ONLY active, realised culling counts\n     (?:were|was)\\s+culled|hitting)\\b\n(?=[^.]{0,40}\\b(?:\\d|million|millions|thousand|thousands|record|largest|unprecedented|severe|significant|overwhelming|devastating|disaster|disasters|emergency|emergencies)\\b)\n```\n# Passive/future forms (\"to be culled\", \"had to be culled\", \"planning to cull\")\n# fall through to Q8 (capability) or Q10 (speculative relief).\n\n**Clarification (v 2.16.2)** — Containment actions  \n\"Birds were *euthanized/depopulated* to prevent spread\" is **Neutral** unless paired with an explicit large-scale impact (e.g., \"euthanized ***millions*** of birds across 10 states\").\n\nIf the parser lemmatises verbs, **keep only the past-tense form** `culled`; exclude the lemma \"cull\" and its gerund unless explicitly preceded by a past-tense auxiliary (\"were/was culling\") that confirms an event already occurred.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` ",

  "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Segments**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with going through these ten segments and determining if Q3 applies. That means I need to look for sentences that feature a \"moderate\" verb coupled with information about the scale or impact. I've been given a list of those moderate verbs, which is helpful.\n\nLet's dive in:\n\n1.  **Segment 1:**  Nope. No moderate verbs, and nothing about impact. Easy pass.\n2.  **Segment 2:**  Not a match. While there *is* impact information (864 people, 456 deaths), the verbs used are simple factual reports: \"contracted,\" \"resulting.\" Not moderate verbs.\n3.  **Segment 3:**  Again, no. \"Is responsible for\" is the key phrase, and that isn't on my moderate verb list. We have \"at least 25,000 turkeys\" as an impact, but wrong verb.\n4.  **Segment 4:**  Another \"no.\" The relevant verb, \"planning to cull,\" is in a future/planned tense. My instructions say to only focus on *realized* impacts here. This falls to another question in the workflow, Q10.\n5.  **Segment 5:**  No, because \"were blocking\" isn't a moderate verb, and the 'affected area' is a background context, not a specific impact measurement.\n6.  **Segment 6:**  Not a yes. Though the impact is implied (\"turkey deaths in two farms\"), none of the verbs are the right ones.\n7.  **Segment 7:**  Nope. Nothing here about scale or impact, and the verbs are all action-oriented, not describing the effect of a virus.\n8.  **Segment 8:**  Nope. Although there is a risk, the 'very low' risk is more Q5.\n9.  **Segment 9:**  This one *almost* got me. The impact is there (\"shortages,\" \"increase in prices\"), but \"threatens to spark\" is a future, not a present/past tense verb denoting impact.\n10. **Segment 10:**  This is a definite no. \"Killed\" and \"cost\" are verbs describing the impact, but my instructions specifically say to exclude them. And the 50 million birds etc. is the magnitude.\n\nSo, after going through each segment, it's clear: none of them meet the Q3 criteria. I'll format the output as a JSON array as instructed.\n"
