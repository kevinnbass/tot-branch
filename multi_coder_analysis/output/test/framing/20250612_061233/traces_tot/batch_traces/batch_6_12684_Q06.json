  "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Q6 (Minimiser + Scale Contrast for Reassurance)**\n\nOkay, here's the rundown of my analysis, applying Q6 ('Minimiser + Scale Contrast for Reassurance') to each text segment. My primary focus is to identify if the segments employ both a minimiser (like 'only' or 'just') and a clear scale contrast to downplay significance and create a reassuring effect.\n\nMy initial approach involved a quick scan for the minimiser tokens. It's a quick check to see if those key words are present. Following that, I look for an explicit or implicitly indicated scale contrast. If both elements are present, and they seem to be working in concert, I mark the segment as fulfilling Q6. If either is missing, or they don't function together as intended, it's a \"no\" for that segment.\n\n*   **Segment 1:** The statement mentions that human infection is \"rare,\" but that's an adjective, not a minimiser. There's no scale contrast either, so no Q6.\n*   **Segment 2:** This segment presents a contrast between \"Americans\" and \"worldwide\" cases, but there is no minimiser used with the numbers, so again, no Q6.\n*   **Segments 3-8:** Across these segments, I found no minimisers. The numbers are often presented without that kind of qualification. No Q6 here.\n*   **Segment 9:** It does mention \"50 million birds\" and a contrast, \"across 15 states.\" However, there's no minimiser preceding the 50 million, so still, no Q6.\n\nIn short, none of these segments meet the criteria for Q6. No instances of the reassurance technique were detected. Therefore, all answers will be \"no\", with the standard rationale (absence of both a minimiser and a scale contrast working in tandem). The JSON output is ready.\n"
