Context and the 'Principle of Cue Sufficiency' are key.)**\n\n**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**\n* Authorial use of vivid, active verbs or metaphors to describe the spread or impact of a threat, especially when combined with its scale or severity, thereby emphasizing its uncontrolled, rapid, or overwhelming nature. Example: Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)\n\n**Alarmist - Examples:**\n* \"The economic impact of the subject on the agricultural sector is a ticking time-bomb for food security,\" said the analyst. (Alarmist → The analyst's quote uses a potent metaphor \"ticking time-bomb,\" framing the economic impact with fear/urgency.)\n* Author: \"Political inaction is steering us towards a catastrophic crisis related to the subject.\" (Alarmist → Author's framing of political aspect through loaded language like \"catastrophic crisis,\" assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Author-driven, vivid metaphor & intensifier):**\n  * Author: \"The virus is a raging inferno, tearing through populations with terrifying speed, leaving devastation in its wake.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses vivid metaphor 'raging inferno,' 'tearing through,' 'terrifying speed,' and 'devastation in its wake.' Decisive cues: 'raging inferno,' 'terrifying speed'.\"\n* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: \"The disease ravaged poultry flocks across three states, leading to immense economic losses.\" (Alarmist → 'Ravaged' + 'across three states' + 'immense economic losses' create a strong alarmist frame).\n* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: \"Confirmed cases soared past one million, overwhelming healthcare systems.\" (Alarmist → 'Soared past one million' + 'overwhelming healthcare systems' creates a strong alarmist frame).\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – High-potency verb** | \"An outbreak ravaged farms across three states.\" | **Alarmist** | \"ravaged\" (vivid, destructive verb) |\n| **Alarmist – Superlative-negative-noun** | \"The H5N1 wave is now considered the most expensive animal-health disaster in U.S. history.\" | **Alarmist** | \"most expensive...disaster\" (superlative + negative noun) |\n| **Alarmist – Critical alert phrase** | \"State authorities remain on high alert for new cases.\" | **Alarmist** | \"on high alert\" (critical alert phrase) |\n\n**Boundary guard:** If the verb is \"hit / hitting / swept / surged\" but the segment gives no numbers, adjectives or metaphors that convey magnitude, treat it as Neutral. Alarmist fires only when a concrete scale/impact phrase is coupled.\n\n**⚠ Context caveat for \"soaring/soared/soar\":**  \nTreat \"amid **soaring inflation**\" or any usage where *soaring* modifies a **background, macro context** (inflation, interest-rates, temperatures, etc.) as **contextual — ignore for Alarmist coding**.  \nOnly count it when the vivid verb modifies a **direct impact noun** of the threat (cases, prices, losses, deaths, production, shortages …).\n\n**Regex Pattern (refined):**  \n```regex\n\\b(?:  # high-potency verbs that always count\n      ravaged|devastated|skyrocketed|plummeted|crashed|nosedived|\n      tanked|slaughtered|exploding|raging|tearing\\sthrough|\n      overwhelmed|crippling|\n      # soared/soaring ONLY when followed within 20 chars by an impact noun\n      soar(?:ed|ing)?(?=[^.]{0,20}\\b\n            (?:cases?|prices?|costs?|loss(?:es)?|deaths?|fatalities|\n             production|output|supply|shortages?)\\b)|\n      # NEW (superlative-negative-noun) patterns\n      (?:most|record(?:-breaking)?|worst)\\s+\\w{0,12}?\\s+\n            (?:disaster|crisis|outbreak|catastrophe|calamity)|\n             # NEW (critical-alert phrase – fires only when threat keyword is nearby)\n       (?:                                     # critical‑alert phrase (bidirectional)\n         on\\s+high\\s+alert(?=[^.]{0,40}\\b(?:outbreak|virus|flu|disease|h5n1|threat|danger|risk)\\b)|\n         (?:outbreak|virus|flu|disease|h5n1|threat|danger|risk)\\b[^.]{0,40}on\\s+high\\s+alert\n       )\n) \\b\n```\n\nThis keeps prior behaviour for existing vivid verbs while ensuring\n\"soaring\" is only Alarmist when it amplifies the **event's realised impact**,\nnot when it sets a macro-economic backdrop (\"amid soaring inflation\").\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` ",

  "thoughts": "**Q2 Evaluation Summary**\n\nAs requested, I've assessed 55 text segments according to the Q2 rules, focusing on high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, and the \"on high alert\" + threat word pattern.\n\nMy process involved a careful, line-by-line examination of each segment. I was particularly attentive to the \"soaring\" caveat (impact on a direct noun, not background context) and the \"on high alert\" requirement (nearby threat word). I've mentally noted the relevant aspects for each segment.\n\nI found two segments that meet the Q2 criteria and therefore suggest an Alarmist frame. These are:\n\n*   **seg_v5_23_101_chunk0**: This segment contains the high-potency verb \"ravaged\" and uses \"soared\" to modify a noun directly impacted (\"prices\").\n*   **seg_v5_38_101_chunk0**: This segment employs the superlative + negative noun combination \"most destructive\".\n\nAll other segments were found *not* to contain any Q2 cues.  My primary focus was to accurately identify and provide a rationale for each decision. My output will be a JSON array as specified, ready for further processing.\n"
