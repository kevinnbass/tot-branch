The intent to reassure must be evident in the presentation, not inferred from the facts being merely positive.\n\n**Key Differentiators from Neutral (updated):**\n* Neutral reports positive facts; Reassuring adds explicit calming / optimistic amplification **or an intensified *low-risk* judgement about *current human safety*.**\n* Neutral uses standard descriptive terms for positive outcomes; Reassuring frames them with active confidence or relief.\n* Neutral may state a low risk; **Reassuring explicitly highlights the *very/exceptionally low* risk level to calm the audience.**\n* Neutral reports solutions/capabilities; Reassuring links them **directly to present safety for the public/consumers** *or* comes from a recognised public authority.\n\n**Inclusion Criteria (Reassuring):**\n* A directly quoted source **or the author** uses explicit calming language **or** an *intensified low-risk evaluation* (\"risk is **very low** for humans\") that clearly signals current safety/minimised danger.\n* Statements that not only report positive facts but also explicitly frame these facts as reasons for reduced concern or increased confidence about safety or control.\n  * **Example:** \"Vaccination rates have thankfully reached 80% in the target population, a wonderfully high figure that provides excellent protection and means the community is now much safer.\" (Reassuring. Cues: 'thankfully,' 'wonderfully high,' 'excellent protection,' 'much safer').\n* Direct assurances of safety, control, or manageability from the author or a quoted source.\n  * **Example:** \"Quote: 'We have stockpiled 30 million doses of the antiviral, which is excellent news and means our citizens are very well protected against any immediate threat from this virus.'\" (Reassuring. Cues: 'excellent news,' 'very well protected').\n**Preparedness cues fire only when BOTH conditions hold (strict guard):**\n1. *Speaker is a government or public‑health authority* **AND**  \n2. *Capability phrase links explicitly to present public/consumer safety* (≤ 40 chars span) (\"…so the public can rest easy\", \"…meaning consumers are protected\").  \nSuperlative boasts alone (\"strongest surveillance program\") are Neutral.  \nCorporate self-statements lacking a safety link stay Neutral (Rule C).  \n  * **Example (Neutral):** \"Tyson Foods is prepared for situations like this and has robust plans in place.\"\n\n**Minimal Pair Examples for Reassuring vs. Neutral:**\n* **Neutral:** \"The latest tests on the water supply showed no contaminants.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Reports absence of negative. No explicit reassuring language from the author/source about broader safety.\"\n* **Reassuring:** \"Officials confirmed the latest tests on the water supply showed no contaminants, declaring, 'This is excellent news, and residents can be fully confident in the safety of their drinking water.'\"\n  * Reasoning: \"The official's quote explicitly frames the negative test as 'excellent news' and a reason for 'full confidence' and 'safety.' Decisive cues: 'excellent news,' 'fully confident in the safety'.\"\n\n**⚠️ Important Exclusion (v2.16.1):**\n* **Neutral (NOT Reassuring):** \"The cases do not present an immediate public-health concern, the agency said.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"This is a bare negation statement without additional calming amplification. Falls under Q7 (bare negations) rather than Q5.\"\n\n\n> **Precedence Note (v 2.16.3)** – If a sentence matches more than one row  \n> in the table above, the order top→bottom decides.  \n>   *Example*: \"We are confident we are fully prepared …\" → **Confidence** row wins.\n\n**Regex Pattern (broadened):**  \n# Guard – the pattern for Direct-Consumption-Safety only fires when the word “safe” (or inflections) is present in the same clause.\n```regex\n \\b(?:no\\s+cause\\s+for\\s+alarm|\n     public\\s+can\\s+rest\\s+easy|\n     fully\\s+under\\s+control|\n     completely\\s+safe|\n     (?:we\\s+are\\s+confident\\b|we're\\s+confident\\b|\n     rest\\s+assured|\n     situation\\s+contained|\n     providing\\s+relief|feel(?:ing)?\\s+positive|feel(?:ing)?\\s+optimistic)|\n     (risk|likelihood|chance)\\s+(?:of\\s+\\w+\\s+)?(?:is|are|remains|stay|stays)\\s+(?:very|extremely|exceptionally|remarkably)\\s+low|\n     # Explicit consumption safety\n     (?:is|are|remains|remain|stay|stays)\\s+(?:completely\\s+|totally\\s+|perfectly\\s+|entirely\\s+)?safe\\s+(?:to\\s+eat|for\\s+(?:human\\s+)?consumption|for\\s+(?:all\\s+)?(?:consumers?|people|humans|residents|citizens))|\n     # Prepared/ready cue qualifies only if public/consumer term within 40 chars\n     (?:fully|well)\\s+(?:prepared|ready)\\s+(?:to\\s+(?:handle|deal\\s+with)|for)\n      .{0,40}\\b(?:public|consumers?|customers?|people|residents|citizens)\\b)\\b\n```\n\n> **Guard:** score as *Reassuring* only when the speaker is an official\n>  body or the author.

  "thoughts": "**JSON Output for Q5 Analysis**\n\nAs instructed, I've meticulously analyzed each text segment for explicit calming cues according to Q5, a key component of my risk assessment framework. I focused on identifying instances of positive framing, explicit safety assurances, and low-risk evaluations with intensifiers, as detailed in the Q5 guidelines.  My analysis, driven by the need to identify these cues, resulted in the following JSON array:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_8_1000_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_9_1000_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_10_1000_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_11_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_12_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_13_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_14_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_15_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"'extremely low'\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_16_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_17_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_18_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_19_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_20_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_21_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_22_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_24_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_25_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_26_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_27_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_28_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_29_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_30_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_33_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\": \"seg_v5_34_101_chunk0\",\n    \"q5_match\": \"no\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment\":"
