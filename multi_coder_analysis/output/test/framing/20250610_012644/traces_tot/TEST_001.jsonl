{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'deadly'.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Alarmist Frame Detected**\n\nOkay, I'm working with the segment \"The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled,\" and I'm assessing it against Q1 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if it contains an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. I see \"so,\" which is clearly an intensifier, and \"deadly,\" which is a risk-adjective. The intensifier \"so\" *does* directly modify \"deadly.\"  This fits the \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj\" pattern in the Q1 rulebook and aligns with the \"Alarmist â€“ Intensifier + adjective\" example. Since the answer to Q1 is \"yes,\" I'll frame this as *Alarmist*. My JSON output will be `{\"answer\": \"yes\", \"rationale\": \"The cue 'so deadly' indicates an alarmist frame.\"}`. The Precedence Ladder dictates this response."}
