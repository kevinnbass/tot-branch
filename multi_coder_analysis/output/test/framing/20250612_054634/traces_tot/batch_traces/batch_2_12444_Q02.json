Context and the 'Principle of Cue Sufficiency' are key.)**\n\n**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**\n* Authorial use of vivid, active verbs or metaphors to describe the spread or impact of a threat, especially when combined with its scale or severity, thereby emphasizing its uncontrolled, rapid, or overwhelming nature. Example: Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)\n\n**Alarmist - Examples:**\n* \"The economic impact of the subject on the agricultural sector is a ticking time-bomb for food security,\" said the analyst. (Alarmist → The analyst's quote uses a potent metaphor \"ticking time-bomb,\" framing the economic impact with fear/urgency.)\n* Author: \"Political inaction is steering us towards a catastrophic crisis related to the subject.\" (Alarmist → Author's framing of political aspect through loaded language like \"catastrophic crisis,\" assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Author-driven, vivid metaphor & intensifier):**\n  * Author: \"The virus is a raging inferno, tearing through populations with terrifying speed, leaving devastation in its wake.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses vivid metaphor 'raging inferno,' 'tearing through,' 'terrifying speed,' and 'devastation in its wake.' Decisive cues: 'raging inferno,' 'terrifying speed'.\"\n* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: \"The disease ravaged poultry flocks across three states, leading to immense economic losses.\" (Alarmist → 'Ravaged' + 'across three states' + 'immense economic losses' create a strong alarmist frame).\n* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: \"Confirmed cases soared past one million, overwhelming healthcare systems.\" (Alarmist → 'Soared past one million' + 'overwhelming healthcare systems' creates a strong alarmist frame).\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – High-potency verb** | \"An outbreak ravaged farms across three states.\" | **Alarmist** | \"ravaged\" (vivid, destructive verb) |\n| **Alarmist – Superlative-negative-noun** | \"The H5N1 wave is now considered the most expensive animal-health disaster in U.S. history.\" | **Alarmist** | \"most expensive...disaster\" (superlative + negative noun) |\n| **Alarmist – Critical alert phrase** | \"State authorities remain on high alert for new cases.\" | **Alarmist** | \"on high alert\" (critical alert phrase) |\n\n**Boundary guard:** If the verb is \"hit / hitting / swept / surged\" but the segment gives no numbers, adjectives or metaphors that convey magnitude, treat it as Neutral.

  "thoughts": "**Q2 Application: A Thorough Evaluation**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with a meticulous review of ten text segments, applying Q2 to each. My focus is on identifying any instances of high-potency verbs, impactful metaphors, superlative and negative noun combinations, or the \"on high alert\" phrase coupled with a word indicating threat.\n\nI went through each segment meticulously:\n\n1.  **seg_v5_11_1001_chunk0**: Nothing there. It just states basic information about the rarity of infection.\n2.  **seg_v5_12_1001_chunk0**: This one offers statistics but uses neutral language. \"Contracted\" and \"resulting\" don't meet the criteria. \"Highly pathogenic\" is a technical term, not a cue.\n3.  **seg_v5_1_1_chunk0**: \"Responsible for the deaths\" is a factual statement, not a high-potency verb.\n4.  **seg_v5_2_1_chunk0**: \"Cull\" is a technical term used in veterinary practices and doesn't fit the bill.\n5.  **seg_v5_3_1_chunk0**:  \"Blocking access\" and \"affected\" are fairly neutral phrases.\n6.  **seg_v5_4_1_chunk0**: \"Deadly\" is an adjective, not a verb or metaphor. \"Responsible for the turkey deaths\" is a plain statement of fact, and \"found its way\" is a benign turn of phrase.\n7.  **seg_v5_11_1004_chunk0**: This segment primarily discusses preventative measures and reporting. Nothing that stands out.\n8.  **seg_v5_12_1004_chunk0**:  \"Contracting\" is not high-potency. \"Very low\" is a reassuring cue, relevant to another criteria set.\n9.  **seg_v5_13_1004_chunk0**: \"Deadly\" again, but as an adjective. \"Threatens to spark\" is a verb phrase, but not strong enough. \"Soaring inflation\" is noted, but contextually separate.\n10. **seg_v5_14_1004_chunk0**:  \"Killed\" is factual.\n\nMy conclusion is clear: none of these segments contain the specific, high-impact cues I was looking for. Therefore, the answer for all ten segments is \"no.\"  I've thoroughly applied Q2 and found no instances of the targeted language.\n"
