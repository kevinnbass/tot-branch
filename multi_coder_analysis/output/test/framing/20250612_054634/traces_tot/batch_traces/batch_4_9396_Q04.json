(Rationale: The rhetorical question uses emotive language 'have to die' and implies criticism of inaction, framing the situation as urgent and severe.)\n  * Example (Quote-driven): 'The activist asked, \"Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?\"' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The quoted rhetorical question uses 'disaster unfolds' to frame the situation alarmingly.)\n  * **Example (Rhetorical question from author implying worry):** Author: \"With new variants emerging rapidly, should humans be worried about the next pandemic?\" → Alarmist (if the context suggests this is not a simple information request but a way to frame emerging variants as a worrisome threat).\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – Loaded Q** | \"Should consumers be worried about buying eggs?\" | **Alarmist** | Loaded rhetorical question implying worry |\n\n**Regex Pattern:** `\\b(?:should|can|could|will)\\s+\\w+\\s+(?:be\\s+)?(?:worried|concerned)\\b`\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` ",

  "thoughts": "**Applying Q4: Rhetorical Question Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with reviewing ten text segments and determining whether each contains a loaded rhetorical question that's meant to trigger alarm or fear, as per Q4. This is a straightforward task, really. My expertise comes into play in quickly identifying such rhetorical devices, which I know often involve emotional appeals and implied threats.\n\nI went through each segment meticulously:\n\n1.  **seg\\_v5\\_11\\_1001\\_chunk0:** No question, so no issue.\n2.  **seg\\_v5\\_12\\_1001\\_chunk0:** No question, moving on.\n3.  **seg\\_v5\\_1\\_1\\_chunk0:** Nope, no questions here.\n4.  **seg\\_v5\\_2\\_1\\_chunk0:** Another clean segment, no questions.\n5.  **seg\\_v5\\_3\\_1\\_chunk0:** Nothing to flag, no questions.\n6.  **seg\\_v5\\_4\\_1\\_chunk0:** Ah, this one *mentions* uncertainty (\"It was not clear...\"), but it's a statement, not a question aimed at the reader. A common mistake non-experts would make. This doesn't meet the criteria of a loaded rhetorical question, so it's a \"no.\"\n7.  **seg\\_v5\\_11\\_1004\\_chunk0:** No questions, nothing to analyze.\n8.  **seg\\_v5\\_12\\_1004\\_chunk0:** No questions again.\n9.  **seg\\_v5\\_13\\_1004\\_chunk0:** No loaded rhetorical questions here.\n10. **seg\\_v5\\_14\\_1004\\_chunk0:** And the last one is also clear.\n\nUltimately, after careful review, I found *zero* instances of a loaded rhetorical question designed to provoke alarm or urgency within any of the ten segments. My answer for all segments is \"no.\" This data is complete.\n"
