(Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: \"The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%.\" (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).\n* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: \"Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds.\" (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').\n\n**Key Principle:** \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" \"plummeted\" can be potent verbs on their own (see Q2) if used dramatically. This rule specifically addresses their use when their alarmist nature is confirmed by accompanying details of scale/impact.\n\n**Boundary Requirements (clarified):**\n1. Verb **must appear in the approved list / regex**.  \n2. Must denote realised impact (not a plan or hypothetical).  \n3. Plain outcome verbs (*killed, died, affected, reported*) are excluded—Neutral unless other cues fire.\n\n**Examples of Scale/Impact Indicators:**\n- Numerical quantities: \"millions,\" \"thousands,\" \"50%,\" \"record numbers\"\n- Comparative terms: \"largest,\" \"highest,\" \"most severe,\" \"unprecedented\"\n- Impact descriptors: \"overwhelming,\" \"devastating losses,\" \"widespread damage\"\n\n> **New aspect guard.** The moderate-verb must denote **realised impact** – NOT merely an intention or hypothetical.  \n\n**Regex Pattern (tightened – comment shows exclusion):**\n```regex\n\\b(hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|\n     # ONLY active, realised culling counts\n     (?:were|was)\\s+culled|hitting)\\b\n(?=[^.]{0,40}\\b(?:\\d|million|millions|thousand|thousands|record|largest|unprecedented|severe|significant|overwhelming|devastating|disaster|disasters|emergency|emergencies)\\b)\n```\n# Passive/future forms (\"to be culled\", \"had to be culled\", \"planning to cull\")\n# fall through to Q8 (capability) or Q10 (speculative relief).\n\n**Clarification (v 2.16.2)** — Containment actions  \n\"Birds were *euthanized/depopulated* to prevent spread\" is **Neutral** unless paired with an explicit large-scale impact (e.g., \"euthanized ***millions*** of birds across 10 states\").\n\nIf the parser lemmatises verbs, **keep only the past-tense form** `culled`; exclude the lemma \"cull\" and its gerund unless explicitly preceded by a past-tense auxiliary (\"were/was culling\") that confirms an event already occurred.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` ",

  "thoughts": "**Evaluating Segments for Moderate Verbs and Impact**\n\nOkay, I've got a task: go through 10 text segments and check them against Q3, which means I'm looking for a moderate verb paired with information about scale or impact. I'm using the provided rules and regex to guide me. Let's see how I approach each segment:\n\n1.  **Segment 1:** This one's easy. No moderate verbs, and no impact information. No match.\n\n2.  **Segment 2:** I see several verbs, but none are on the moderate list. They're more about factual reporting. While there's scale/impact (\"864 people,\" \"456 deaths\"), the verbs don't qualify.  No match.\n\n3.  **Segment 3:**  \"Is responsible for\" is not on the list, even though \"at least 25,000 turkeys\" sounds like an impact.  Not a match.\n\n4.  **Segment 4:**  \"Were planning to cull\" is a plan, not something that's happened yet. Rule dictates that passive and future forms fall into Q8 or Q10. Not a match.\n\n5.  **Segment 5:**  \"Were blocking\" - no scale/impact tied to the verb. The \"affected area\" describes the context, not an impact metric. Not a match.\n\n6.  **Segment 6:**  More reporting verbs that don't qualify. The scale/impact is \"turkey deaths in two farms,\" but not with the right kind of verb.  Not a match.\n\n7.  **Segment 7:**  Again, just verbs about what people \"should\" do, or are doing, with no impact. No match.\n\n8.  **Segment 8:**  \"Contracting\" and \"found\" - again, no.  \"Very low\" is a cue for something else (Q5), but doesn't change the Q3 outcome. No match.\n\n9.  **Segment 9:** \"Threatens to spark\" - that's potential, not something that's happened yet. \"Shortages,\" \"further increase\" sound like impacts, but the verb is about potential. Not a match.\n\n10. **Segment 10:**  \"Killed\" and \"cost\" are explicitly excluded from the list. Although the impact is there (\"50 million birds,\" \"$1 billion\"), the verbs don't fit. Not a match.\n\nSo, after going through each segment, it's a \"no\" on Q3 for all of them. I'll format my output as a JSON array as instructed.\n"
