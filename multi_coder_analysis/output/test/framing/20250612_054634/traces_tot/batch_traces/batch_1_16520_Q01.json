The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)\n\n**Clarification on \"deadly,\" \"fatal,\" \"lethal\":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, \"deadly\" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.\n\n**Minimal Pair Examples:**\n* **Neutral:** \"The virus is contagious.\"\n* **Alarmist (Author):** \"The virus is frighteningly contagious, spreading like wildfire.\" (Cue: 'frighteningly,' 'spreading like wildfire').\n\n**New Comparative Minimal Pair Example:**\n* **Alarmist:** \"Scientists warn the virus is becoming deadlier each season.\"\n* **Neutral:** \"Scientists track how the virus becomes more common each season.\"\n\n**⚠ TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  \nA term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. \"lethal dose 50\").  \n**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – Intensifier + adjective** | \"The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.\" | **Alarmist** | \"so deadly\" (intensifier + risk adjective) |\n| **Alarmist – Deadly-from-outset idiom** | \"H5N1 is deadly from the start, vets warn.\" | **Alarmist** | \"deadly from the start\" (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom) |\n\n**Regex Pattern  (v2.16.2):**\n```regex\n # Ignore the fixed scientific term \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\"\n \\b(?:(?:highly(?!\\s+pathogenic\\s+avian(?:\\s+flu|\\s+influenza)?))\n     |very|deadlier|more|extremely|severely|so|particularly|frighteningly)  \n     (?:\\s+\\w+){0,3}\\s+\n # Risk-adj list (adding infectious, transmissible) while pruning ECON adjective \"volatile\"\n (deadly|lethal|dangerous|severe|catastrophic|brutal|contagious|virulent|destructive|infectious|transmissible)\\b|\n # NEW (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom)\n \\bdeadly\\s+from\\s+(?:the\\s+)?(?:start|outset)\\b\n```\n\n**EXCLUSION — \"volatile\"**  \nWhen \"volatile\" modifies *prices/markets/rates* it is treated as an **economic metric** (see Q9) and never triggers Q1.\n\n> **Technical-term guard** – \"highly pathogenic\" used as part of the formal\n> disease name (HPAI) is **Neutral** unless further alarmist cues appear.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` ",

  "thoughts": "**Applying Rule Q1 to the Text Segments**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with analyzing ten text segments to see if they meet the criteria for Rule Q1: do they contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\"? Let's break it down:\n\n*   **Segment 1-5:** These segments were pretty straightforward. They discussed various aspects of bird flu, including infection rates, actions taken by authorities, and general descriptions. There were no instances of intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives, nor the specified idiom. The mention of \"rare\" in Segment 1 doesn't count because it refers to a low-risk adjective. **Answer: No for all.**\n\n*   **Segment 6:** This one mentioned the \"deadly H5N8 virus.\" However, \"deadly\" itself is not automatically flagged; it has to be intensified or part of the specified idiom. It's used factually in this context, so it doesn't trigger Q1. **Answer: No.**\n\n*   **Segment 7:** This segment discussed preventative measures and reporting sick birds. There were no intensifiers or comparatives that met the rule. **Answer: No.**\n\n*   **Segment 8:** This stated that the risk of contracting bird flu is \"very low.\" Although it contains an intensifier, \"very\" modifies \"low,\" which is a low-risk adjective. This suggests a reassurance more like Q4. **Answer: No.**\n\n*   **Segment 9:** This segment contained \"deadly to domestic fowl.\" It's factually used and not intensified. Also \"threatens\" is used which is not on the list of vivid verbs from Q2. There's also \"soaring inflation\". which is an unrelated background condition, not a direct qualifier of the risk. **Answer: No.**\n\n*   **Segment 10:** This mentioned factual figures like \"killed 50 million birds\" and \"cost... nearly $1 billion.\" This information is a measure of impact, and not intensified language about the threat itself. **Answer: No.**\n\nSo, after a thorough examination, it looks like none of the segments triggered Rule Q1. I'll now build the JSON array, providing each segment's ID, my \"no\" answer, and the rationale for each.\n"
