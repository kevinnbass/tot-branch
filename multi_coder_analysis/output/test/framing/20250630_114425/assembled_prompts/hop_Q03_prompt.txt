# === GLOBAL BEDROCK PRINCIPLE (DO NOT DELETE) ===
# You are an expert claim-framing coder following a mandatory 12-step decision tree.
# Your analysis must be grounded *only* in the provided text and rules.
# You will be asked one question at a time.
#
# Bedrock Principle: CODE THE PRESENTATION, NOT THE FACTS.
# The frame is determined by explicit linguistic choices, not the objective severity of the facts.
# A severe fact presented factually is Neutral. A reassuring fact presented factually is Neutral.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  SYMMETRY RULE  (central, referenced not repeated)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------
#  Alarmist ≠ "any negative fact"; Reassuring ≠ "any positive fact".
#  • **Alarmist fires only when a negative / hazardous fact is explicitly
#    amplified** (intensifier, vivid verb, scale exaggeration, loaded metaphor).
#  • **Reassuring fires only when a positive / low-risk fact is explicitly
#    framed for calm or safety** ("public can rest easy", "risk is *very* low",
#    "fully under control", "only 1 out of 1 000 cases", etc.).
#  • Positive or low-risk facts stated neutrally → **Neutral**.
#  • Negative or high-risk facts stated neutrally → **Neutral**.
#
#  🔄 **ACTIVE-RHETORIC PRINCIPLE** — a cue fires only when the
#  wording itself frames perception (intensifier, minimiser, "safe", etc.).
#  Stating a good/bad fact neutrally ≡ Neutral.

# === NEW CROSS‑HOP PRINCIPLE – SEMANTIC CONTEXT HANDLING ===
# Where a *quantifier / denominator* or *impact scale* lands in an
# **immediately adjacent clause or sentence** that is inseparable from
# the first (e.g. "Only three samples were irregular. Out of 5 000 that
# is a tiny share.") the model **may treat the pair as one rhetorical
# unit**.  Use this leeway **only when**  
# • the second clause is ≤ 20 characters away after the period/dash, **and**  
# • it unambiguously quantifies the *same* event.  
# Regex cannot reason over adjacency; the LLM must decide.

# === TECH_TERM_GUARD  (canonical, single source of truth) ===
# The biomedical collocations below are neutral taxonomic labels and
# NEVER count as intensifiers:  
#     "highly pathogenic (avian) influenza", "HPAI",
#     "highly pathogenic / virulent / contagious / transmissible"
# when occurring ≤ 3 tokens before a pathogen name.  A separate alarm
# cue must fire for Alarmist coding.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Context guard for vivid language
> A vivid verb/adjective that colours a **background condition**  
> (e.g. "amid **soaring** inflation", "during a **plunging** market")  
> is **ignored** for Alarmist coding.  
> Alarmist cues fire only when the vivid language depicts the threat's
> **own realised impact** (cases, deaths, prices, losses, shortages, etc.).

> **Context guard for psychological verbs**
> *Spark, stoke, reignite,* or *raise fears* describe a **public reaction**, not the realised impact of the threat itself.
> Treat them as **Neutral** unless the sentence either  
> (a) uses a vivid intensifier (*"mass panic"*, *"public alarm"*) **or**  
> (b) couples the verb with a concrete scale of realised harm  
> (e.g. "sparked panic **after** 5 million birds died").
> Plain "reigniting fears of another outbreak" is Neutral.

#
# ⇩ Precedence Ladder (authoritative; other hops now *reference* this ID)
# Precedence Ladder: If multiple cues appear, the highest-ranking rule (lowest Q number) determines the frame.
# 1. INTENSIFIER + RISK-ADJECTIVE -> Alarmist
# 2. VIVID-VERB -> Alarmist
# 3. MODERATE-VERB + SCALE/METRIC -> Alarmist
# 4. EXPLICIT CALMING -> Reassuring  
#    (Inside Q5 the row order Confidence > Preparedness > Low-Risk > Amplification)
#   • Direct food-safety assurances ("safe to eat/for consumption") belong here.
# 5. BARE NEGATION / CAPABILITY -> Neutral
# 6. DEFAULT -> Neutral
# If a segment simultaneously triggers an Alarmist cue **and** a Reassuring cue,
# the presentation is **mixed** → code **Neutral** (see Q12 default rule).
# **Technical‑term guard is absolute** – "highly pathogenic (avian) influenza"
# and similar taxonomy never functions as an intensifier, even inside quotes.

#  MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP DECISION PROCESS  (applies to every hop)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------
#  1. Start with Q1 and evaluate strictly against its rule text.
#  2. **If** your answer is **"yes"**:  
#       • Emit the frame dictated by the Precedence Ladder.  
#       • **Immediately STOP** evaluating lower-numbered hops.  
#       • Proceed to the self-audit checks below.  
#  3. Else → move to the next hop (Q {n + 1}) and repeat.
#
#  ✅ The 6-point self-audit checklist has been moved to a shared
#  **GLOBAL_FOOTER.txt** fragment that is appended *after* the
#  `YOUR JSON REPLY` stub inside every hop prompt so the model
#  reads it immediately before generating its answer.

### QUICK DECISION CHECK
• Contains MODERATE VERB (**HIT / SWEPT / SOARED / SURGED / PLUMMETED / PROMPTED / SPIKED / PEAKED / JUMPED / SHOT UP / HARD HIT**) **AND** explicit SCALE token (digit / MILLION / THOUSAND / % / RECORD / UNPRECEDENTED) in same sentence?  
• Ignore if action is only *planned* (e.g. "to consider culling").  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: The region was severely hit by the virus, resulting in record losses.
## Question: Does the author/source use moderate verbs paired with significant scale/impact information?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"'severely hit' with 'record losses' combines moderate verb with explicit large-scale impact."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: The outbreak hit several farms in the area.
## Question: Does the author/source use moderate verbs paired with significant scale/impact information?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'hit several farms' lacks specific scale/impact details to confirm alarmist framing."}

# NO example (moderate verb + vague impact → Neutral)
## Input Segment: The outbreak is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down.
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'hitting the market' + 'supplies are down' gives no number or record-type scale; stays Neutral."}

=== USER TASK ===
### Segment (StatementID: seg_v5_19_269_chunk0)
'The initial strain then adapted and became endemic in the human population, giving rise to the seasonal flu viruses,' said Professor Massimo Palmarini, director of the Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow University.

### Question Q3
**Q3: Moderate Verbs + Scale/Impact**
Does the author or a quoted source use a 'moderate verb' (e.g., 'swept across,' 'hard hit,' 'soared,' 'plummeted') AND is this verb explicitly paired with information detailing significant scale or impact (e.g., 'millions culled,' 'record losses,' 'overwhelming systems'), as detailed in the rules?

**🔍 Q3 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
<!-- Q3.1 -->
| **Moderate Verb (past-tense)** **+ Scale** | "swept across + millions culled," "hard hit + record losses," "soared + overwhelming systems," **"spiked + record‑high prices," "peaked + doubled costs," "jumped + 27 percent,"** | ✓ |
<!-- Q3.2 -->
| **Moderate Verb (past-tense)** **+ Quantity** | "surged + 50 % increase," "plummeted + largest decline," "hit + thousands affected" | ✓ |
| **Moderate Verb (present/future/plan)** *(e.g. "**planning to cull**", "could hit")* | → **Neutral** |

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Alarmist. No → Proceed to Q4.

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Containment override reminder** – If the sentence already contains a containment verb (cull, slaughter …) **do not** fire Q3. The containment rule handles the scale separately.

**Alarmist - Examples:**
* Author: "The region was severely hit by the virus, resulting in record losses." (Alarmist → Author's use of "severely hit" and "record losses" to describe large-scale harm, assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* Author: 'From Wyoming to Maine, the highly contagious bird flu swept across farms and backyard flocks, prompting millions of chickens and turkeys to be culled.' (Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: "The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%." (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).
* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: "Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds." (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').

**Boundary Requirements:**
1. Verb **must appear in the approved list / regex**.  
2. The scale indicator may sit in a *tight* follow‑on clause joined by
   semicolon, dash or full stop **when the meaning is contiguous**
   (e.g. "plummeted — a 50 % drop in one week").  Use judgment: if a
   human instantly links the two, accept it.  Otherwise require same
   sentence. Generic phrases like "supplies are down / have dropped" are **not enough**.
3. Must denote realised impact (not a plan or hypothetical).
4. Plain outcome verbs (*killed, died, affected, reported*) are excluded—Neutral unless other cues fire.
5. **Containment override (strict).** If the same sentence contains a
   containment verb (*culled, destroyed, euthanised, depopulated*) the
   clause is **Neutral**, even when preceded by *swept, hit, surged* or a
   numeric scale; Alarmist fires only when an **additional** vivid verb or
   metaphor appears.
6. Sentences about **financial or trade metrics** (exports, imports, sales, production) are treated as factual price/metric reporting → Neutral, not Alarmist here.

**Examples of Scale/Impact Indicators:**
- Numerical quantities: "millions," "thousands," "50%," "record numbers"
- Comparative terms: "largest," "highest," "most severe," "unprecedented"
- Impact descriptors: "overwhelming," "devastating losses," "widespread damage"

> **New aspect guard.** The moderate-verb must denote **realised impact** – NOT merely an intention or hypothetical.  

**Clarification** — Containment actions  
Containment verbs ("were/was culled, destroyed, euthanized, depopulated") are **Neutral even with large numbers** *unless* the author adds additional vivid or emotive language (e.g., "brutally destroyed 3 million birds").

► NEW NOTE – 2025-06-18
Containment verbs (culled, euthanised, destroyed, depopulated) **always neutralise** a preceding ModerateVerb + Scale pattern. Do NOT fire Q3 unless an additional vivid/emotive cue is present.

**⚠ Containment-Override Exception:**
The containment-override is **suspended** if the scale is described with extreme language (e.g., "brutally destroyed 3 million", "devastating culling of millions"). In such cases, Q3 can still fire for the extreme framing of the scale itself.

✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**
1. If you answered **"yes"**, STOP processing further questions.
2. Quote decisive cue(s) in the *rationale*.
3. No Alarmist on neutrally stated **bad** facts.
4. No Reassuring on neutrally stated **good / low-risk** facts.
5. First "yes" only – no double hits / overrides.
6. Output must be pure JSON and **nothing else**.

🔧 **Implementation hint** – add a regression test where  
Input: "We are confident our systems are ready." → expect Q5 = yes, Reassuring.

*Re-read this list; fix any violation before sending.*
# 7. If you reach **Q12** and still cannot assign a frame with certainty,
#    return an **Unknown** label:
#        { "answer":"unknown",
#          "rationale":"Q12 reached with no decisive cues; frame unresolved" }
#    Down-stream evaluation will skip these rows.
