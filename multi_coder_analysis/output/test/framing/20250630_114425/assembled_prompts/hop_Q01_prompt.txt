# === GLOBAL BEDROCK PRINCIPLE (DO NOT DELETE) ===
# You are an expert claim-framing coder following a mandatory 12-step decision tree.
# Your analysis must be grounded *only* in the provided text and rules.
# You will be asked one question at a time.
#
# Bedrock Principle: CODE THE PRESENTATION, NOT THE FACTS.
# The frame is determined by explicit linguistic choices, not the objective severity of the facts.
# A severe fact presented factually is Neutral. A reassuring fact presented factually is Neutral.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  SYMMETRY RULE  (central, referenced not repeated)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------
#  Alarmist ≠ "any negative fact"; Reassuring ≠ "any positive fact".
#  • **Alarmist fires only when a negative / hazardous fact is explicitly
#    amplified** (intensifier, vivid verb, scale exaggeration, loaded metaphor).
#  • **Reassuring fires only when a positive / low-risk fact is explicitly
#    framed for calm or safety** ("public can rest easy", "risk is *very* low",
#    "fully under control", "only 1 out of 1 000 cases", etc.).
#  • Positive or low-risk facts stated neutrally → **Neutral**.
#  • Negative or high-risk facts stated neutrally → **Neutral**.
#
#  🔄 **ACTIVE-RHETORIC PRINCIPLE** — a cue fires only when the
#  wording itself frames perception (intensifier, minimiser, "safe", etc.).
#  Stating a good/bad fact neutrally ≡ Neutral.

# === NEW CROSS‑HOP PRINCIPLE – SEMANTIC CONTEXT HANDLING ===
# Where a *quantifier / denominator* or *impact scale* lands in an
# **immediately adjacent clause or sentence** that is inseparable from
# the first (e.g. "Only three samples were irregular. Out of 5 000 that
# is a tiny share.") the model **may treat the pair as one rhetorical
# unit**.  Use this leeway **only when**  
# • the second clause is ≤ 20 characters away after the period/dash, **and**  
# • it unambiguously quantifies the *same* event.  
# Regex cannot reason over adjacency; the LLM must decide.

# === TECH_TERM_GUARD  (canonical, single source of truth) ===
# The biomedical collocations below are neutral taxonomic labels and
# NEVER count as intensifiers:  
#     "highly pathogenic (avian) influenza", "HPAI",
#     "highly pathogenic / virulent / contagious / transmissible"
# when occurring ≤ 3 tokens before a pathogen name.  A separate alarm
# cue must fire for Alarmist coding.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Context guard for vivid language
> A vivid verb/adjective that colours a **background condition**  
> (e.g. "amid **soaring** inflation", "during a **plunging** market")  
> is **ignored** for Alarmist coding.  
> Alarmist cues fire only when the vivid language depicts the threat's
> **own realised impact** (cases, deaths, prices, losses, shortages, etc.).

> **Context guard for psychological verbs**
> *Spark, stoke, reignite,* or *raise fears* describe a **public reaction**, not the realised impact of the threat itself.
> Treat them as **Neutral** unless the sentence either  
> (a) uses a vivid intensifier (*"mass panic"*, *"public alarm"*) **or**  
> (b) couples the verb with a concrete scale of realised harm  
> (e.g. "sparked panic **after** 5 million birds died").
> Plain "reigniting fears of another outbreak" is Neutral.

#
# ⇩ Precedence Ladder (authoritative; other hops now *reference* this ID)
# Precedence Ladder: If multiple cues appear, the highest-ranking rule (lowest Q number) determines the frame.
# 1. INTENSIFIER + RISK-ADJECTIVE -> Alarmist
# 2. VIVID-VERB -> Alarmist
# 3. MODERATE-VERB + SCALE/METRIC -> Alarmist
# 4. EXPLICIT CALMING -> Reassuring  
#    (Inside Q5 the row order Confidence > Preparedness > Low-Risk > Amplification)
#   • Direct food-safety assurances ("safe to eat/for consumption") belong here.
# 5. BARE NEGATION / CAPABILITY -> Neutral
# 6. DEFAULT -> Neutral
# If a segment simultaneously triggers an Alarmist cue **and** a Reassuring cue,
# the presentation is **mixed** → code **Neutral** (see Q12 default rule).
# **Technical‑term guard is absolute** – "highly pathogenic (avian) influenza"
# and similar taxonomy never functions as an intensifier, even inside quotes.

#  MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP DECISION PROCESS  (applies to every hop)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------
#  1. Start with Q1 and evaluate strictly against its rule text.
#  2. **If** your answer is **"yes"**:  
#       • Emit the frame dictated by the Precedence Ladder.  
#       • **Immediately STOP** evaluating lower-numbered hops.  
#       • Proceed to the self-audit checks below.  
#  3. Else → move to the next hop (Q {n + 1}) and repeat.
#
#  ✅ The 6-point self-audit checklist has been moved to a shared
#  **GLOBAL_FOOTER.txt** fragment that is appended *after* the
#  `YOUR JSON REPLY` stub inside every hop prompt so the model
#  reads it immediately before generating its answer.
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 

### QUICK DECISION CHECK
• Contains INTENSIFIER (**SO / VERY / EXTREMELY / HIGHLY / FRIGHTENINGLY / MORE / DEADLIER**) **AND** RISK‑ADJ (**DEADLY / DANGEROUS / SEVERE / CATASTROPHIC / LETHAL / CONTAGIOUS / VIRULENT / DESTRUCTIVE**) in the **same clause**?  
• Skip if it's the taxonomic phrase **"highly pathogenic (avian) influenza / HPAI"**.  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.
## Question: Does the segment contain an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"The intensifier 'so' modifies the risk-adjective 'deadly'."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: A highly pathogenic form of bird flu was detected.
## Question: Does the segment contain an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'highly pathogenic' is a technical term, not an authorial intensifier on a general risk-adjective."}

=== USER TASK ===
### Segment (StatementID: seg_v5_20_269_chunk0)
'The initial strain then adapted and became endemic in the human population, giving rise to the seasonal flu viruses,' said Professor Massimo Palmarini, director of the Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow University. 'This [process of adaptation and becoming endemic] is why it is important to detect human cases of avian influenza as quickly as possible and make sure that we give as little opportunity as possible to the virus to be transmitted further and mutate.'

### Question Q1
**Q1: Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective**
Does the segment feature an intensifier (e.g., 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely') or a comparative adjective (e.g., 'more,' 'deadlier') directly modifying a risk-adjective (e.g., 'deadly,' 'dangerous,' 'severe,' 'catastrophic') as defined in the detailed rules?

**🔍 Q1 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
<!-- Q1.1 -->
| **Intensifier + Risk-Adj** | "so deadly," "very dangerous," "extremely severe," "highly lethal," "frighteningly contagious" | ✓ |
<!-- Q1.2 -->
| **Comparative + Risk-Adj** | "more deadly," "deadlier," "more dangerous," "less safe," "increasingly severe" | ✓ |
<!-- Q1.3 -->
| **Fixed Lethal-from-Outset Idiom** | "deadly from the start," "deadly from the outset" | ✓ |
| **Base Risk-Adj (alone)** | "deadly," "dangerous," "severe" (without intensifier) | → Neutral |

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**
**Outcome when Yes :** Label = Alarmist  
**Outcome when No  :** Return `{ "answer":"no", "rationale": … }`

| If you see… | Frame | Quick test |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective** | Alarmist | **Any single match is sufficient (Precedence #1)** |
| - so/very/extremely/highly/frighteningly/particularly + deadly/lethal/dangerous/brutal/severe/contagious/virulent/destructive | | |
| - more/less/deadlier/safer/higher/lower + same risk adjectives | | |

**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**
* Authorial use of intensifiers (e.g., 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely,' 'incredibly,' 'particularly,' 'frighteningly') coupled with high-valence negative adjectives (e.g., 'destructive,' 'contagious') to describe the subject or its characteristics. The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)

**Clarification on "deadly," "fatal," "lethal":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, "deadly" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.

**Minimal Pair Examples:**
* **Neutral:** "The virus is contagious."
* **Alarmist (Author):** "The virus is frighteningly contagious, spreading like wildfire." (Cue: 'frighteningly,' 'spreading like wildfire').

**Comparative Minimal Pair Example:**
* **Alarmist:** "Scientists warn the virus is becoming deadlier each season."
* **Neutral:** "Scientists track how the virus becomes more common each season."

**⚠ TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  
A term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. "lethal dose 50").  
**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**

*(See **TECH_TERM_GUARD** in `global_header.txt`.)*

**Few-Shot Exemplars:**
| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Alarmist – Intensifier + adjective** | "The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled." | **Alarmist** | "so deadly" (intensifier + risk adjective) |
| **Alarmist – Deadly-from-outset idiom** | "H5N1 is deadly from the start, vets warn." | **Alarmist** | "deadly from the start" (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom) |
| **NON-EXAMPLE** | "Experts are *more worried* now." | **Neutral** | comparative + psychological adjective |

**EXCLUSION — "volatile"**  
When "volatile" modifies *prices/markets/rates* it is treated as an **economic metric** and never triggers Q1.

> **Technical-term guard** – "highly pathogenic" used as part of the formal
> disease name (HPAI) is **Neutral** unless further alarmist cues appear.

#  -----------------------------------------------------------
✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**
1. If you answered **"yes"**, STOP processing further questions.
2. Quote decisive cue(s) in the *rationale*.
3. No Alarmist on neutrally stated **bad** facts.
4. No Reassuring on neutrally stated **good / low-risk** facts.
5. First "yes" only – no double hits / overrides.
6. Output must be pure JSON and **nothing else**.

🔧 **Implementation hint** – add a regression test where  
Input: "We are confident our systems are ready." → expect Q5 = yes, Reassuring.

*Re-read this list; fix any violation before sending.*
# 7. If you reach **Q12** and still cannot assign a frame with certainty,
#    return an **Unknown** label:
#        { "answer":"unknown",
#          "rationale":"Q12 reached with no decisive cues; frame unresolved" }
#    Down-stream evaluation will skip these rows.
