#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (auto-appended to every hop)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------
✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**
1. If you answered **"yes"**, STOP processing further questions.
2. Quote decisive cue(s) in the *rationale*.
3. No Alarmist on neutrally stated **bad** facts.
4. No Reassuring on neutrally stated **good / low-risk** facts.
5. First "yes" only – no double hits / overrides.
6. Output must be pure JSON and **nothing else**.

🔧 **Implementation hint** – add a regression test where  
Input: "We are confident our systems are ready." → expect Q5 = yes, Reassuring.

*Re-read this list; fix any violation before sending.*
# 7. If you reach **Q12** and still cannot assign a frame with certainty,
#    return an **Unknown** label:
#        { "answer":"unknown",
#          "rationale":"Q12 reached with no decisive cues; frame unresolved" }
#    Down-stream evaluation will skip these rows.

# === GLOBAL BEDROCK PRINCIPLE (DO NOT DELETE) ===
# You are an expert claim-framing coder following a mandatory 12-step decision tree.
# Your analysis must be grounded *only* in the provided text and rules.
# You will be asked one question at a time.
#
# Bedrock Principle: CODE THE PRESENTATION, NOT THE FACTS.
# The frame is determined by explicit linguistic choices, not the objective severity of the facts.
# A severe fact presented factually is Neutral. A reassuring fact presented factually is Neutral.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  SYMMETRY RULE  (central, referenced not repeated)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------
#  Alarmist ≠ "any negative fact"; Reassuring ≠ "any positive fact".
#  • **Alarmist fires only when a negative / hazardous fact is explicitly
#    amplified** (intensifier, vivid verb, scale exaggeration, loaded metaphor).
#  • **Reassuring fires only when a positive / low-risk fact is explicitly
#    framed for calm or safety** ("public can rest easy", "risk is *very* low",
#    "fully under control", "only 1 out of 1 000 cases", etc.).
#  • Positive or low-risk facts stated neutrally → **Neutral**.
#  • Negative or high-risk facts stated neutrally → **Neutral**.
#
#  🔄 **ACTIVE-RHETORIC PRINCIPLE** — a cue fires only when the
#  wording itself frames perception (intensifier, minimiser, "safe", etc.).
#  Stating a good/bad fact neutrally ≡ Neutral.

# === NEW CROSS‑HOP PRINCIPLE – SEMANTIC CONTEXT HANDLING ===
# Where a *quantifier / denominator* or *impact scale* lands in an
# **immediately adjacent clause or sentence** that is inseparable from
# the first (e.g. "Only three samples were irregular. Out of 5 000 that
# is a tiny share.") the model **may treat the pair as one rhetorical
# unit**.  Use this leeway **only when**  
# • the second clause is ≤ 20 characters away after the period/dash, **and**  
# • it unambiguously quantifies the *same* event.  
# Regex cannot reason over adjacency; the LLM must decide.

# === TECH_TERM_GUARD  (canonical, single source of truth) ===
# The biomedical collocations below are neutral taxonomic labels and
# NEVER count as intensifiers:  
#     "highly pathogenic (avian) influenza", "HPAI",
#     "highly pathogenic / virulent / contagious / transmissible"
# when occurring ≤ 3 tokens before a pathogen name.  A separate alarm
# cue must fire for Alarmist coding.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Context guard for vivid language
> A vivid verb/adjective that colours a **background condition**  
> (e.g. "amid **soaring** inflation", "during a **plunging** market")  
> is **ignored** for Alarmist coding.  
> Alarmist cues fire only when the vivid language depicts the threat's
> **own realised impact** (cases, deaths, prices, losses, shortages, etc.).

> **Context guard for psychological verbs**
> *Spark, stoke, reignite,* or *raise fears* describe a **public reaction**, not the realised impact of the threat itself.
> Treat them as **Neutral** unless the sentence either  
> (a) uses a vivid intensifier (*"mass panic"*, *"public alarm"*) **or**  
> (b) couples the verb with a concrete scale of realised harm  
> (e.g. "sparked panic **after** 5 million birds died").
> Plain "reigniting fears of another outbreak" is Neutral.

#
# ⇩ Precedence Ladder (authoritative; other hops now *reference* this ID)
# Precedence Ladder: If multiple cues appear, the highest-ranking rule (lowest Q number) determines the frame.
# 1. INTENSIFIER + RISK-ADJECTIVE -> Alarmist
# 2. VIVID-VERB -> Alarmist
# 3. MODERATE-VERB + SCALE/METRIC -> Alarmist
# 4. EXPLICIT CALMING -> Reassuring  
#    (Inside Q5 the row order Confidence > Preparedness > Low-Risk > Amplification)
#   • Direct food-safety assurances ("safe to eat/for consumption") belong here.
# 5. BARE NEGATION / CAPABILITY -> Neutral
# 6. DEFAULT -> Neutral
# If a segment simultaneously triggers an Alarmist cue **and** a Reassuring cue,
# the presentation is **mixed** → code **Neutral** (see Q12 default rule).
# **Technical‑term guard is absolute** – "highly pathogenic (avian) influenza"
# and similar taxonomy never functions as an intensifier, even inside quotes.
#
# You MUST reply in JSON format ONLY. Your entire response must be a single JSON object.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP DECISION PROCESS  (applies to every hop)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------
#  1. Start with Q1 and evaluate strictly against its rule text.
#  2. **If** your answer is **"yes"**:  
#       • Emit the frame dictated by the Precedence Ladder.  
#       • **Immediately STOP** evaluating lower-numbered hops.  
#       • Proceed to the self-audit checks below.  
#  3. Else → move to the next hop (Q {n + 1}) and repeat.
#
#  ✅ The 6-point self-audit checklist has been moved to a shared
#  **GLOBAL_FOOTER.txt** fragment that is appended *after* the
#  `YOUR JSON REPLY` stub inside every hop prompt so the model
#  reads it immediately before generating its answer.

### QUICK DECISION CHECK
• Contains INTENSIFIER (**SO / VERY / EXTREMELY / HIGHLY / FRIGHTENINGLY / MORE / DEADLIER**) **AND** RISK‑ADJ (**DEADLY / DANGEROUS / SEVERE / CATASTROPHIC / LETHAL / CONTAGIOUS / VIRULENT / DESTRUCTIVE**) in the **same clause**?  
• Skip if it's the taxonomic phrase **"highly pathogenic (avian) influenza / HPAI"**.  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.
## Question: Does the segment contain an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"The intensifier 'so' modifies the risk-adjective 'deadly'."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: A highly pathogenic form of bird flu was detected.
## Question: Does the segment contain an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'highly pathogenic' is a technical term, not an authorial intensifier on a general risk-adjective."}

=== USER TASK ===
### Segment (StatementID: {{statement_id}})
{{segment_text}}

### Question Q1
**Q1: Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective**
Does the segment feature an intensifier (e.g., 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely') or a comparative adjective (e.g., 'more,' 'deadlier') directly modifying a risk-adjective (e.g., 'deadly,' 'dangerous,' 'severe,' 'catastrophic') as defined in the detailed rules?

**🔍 Q1 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
<!-- Q1.1 -->
| **Intensifier + Risk-Adj** | "so deadly," "very dangerous," "extremely severe," "highly lethal," "frighteningly contagious" | ✓ |
<!-- Q1.2 -->
| **Comparative + Risk-Adj** | "more deadly," "deadlier," "more dangerous," "less safe," "increasingly severe" | ✓ |
<!-- Q1.3 -->
| **Fixed Lethal-from-Outset Idiom** | "deadly from the start," "deadly from the outset" | ✓ |
| **Base Risk-Adj (alone)** | "deadly," "dangerous," "severe" (without intensifier) | → Neutral |

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**
**Outcome when Yes :** Label = Alarmist  
**Outcome when No  :** Return `{ "answer":"no", "rationale": … }`

| If you see… | Frame | Quick test |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective** | Alarmist | **Any single match is sufficient (Precedence #1)** |
| - so/very/extremely/highly/frighteningly/particularly + deadly/lethal/dangerous/brutal/severe/contagious/virulent/destructive | | |
| - more/less/deadlier/safer/higher/lower + same risk adjectives | | |

**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**
* Authorial use of intensifiers (e.g., 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely,' 'incredibly,' 'particularly,' 'frighteningly') coupled with high-valence negative adjectives (e.g., 'destructive,' 'contagious') to describe the subject or its characteristics. The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)

**Clarification on "deadly," "fatal," "lethal":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, "deadly" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.

**Minimal Pair Examples:**
* **Neutral:** "The virus is contagious."
* **Alarmist (Author):** "The virus is frighteningly contagious, spreading like wildfire." (Cue: 'frighteningly,' 'spreading like wildfire').

**Comparative Minimal Pair Example:**
* **Alarmist:** "Scientists warn the virus is becoming deadlier each season."
* **Neutral:** "Scientists track how the virus becomes more common each season."

**⚠ TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  
A term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. "lethal dose 50").  
**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**

*(See **TECH_TERM_GUARD** in `global_header.txt`.)*

**Few-Shot Exemplars:**
| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Alarmist – Intensifier + adjective** | "The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled." | **Alarmist** | "so deadly" (intensifier + risk adjective) |
| **Alarmist – Deadly-from-outset idiom** | "H5N1 is deadly from the start, vets warn." | **Alarmist** | "deadly from the start" (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom) |
| **NON-EXAMPLE** | "Experts are *more worried* now." | **Neutral** | comparative + psychological adjective |

**EXCLUSION — "volatile"**  
When "volatile" modifies *prices/markets/rates* it is treated as an **economic metric** and never triggers Q1.

> **Technical-term guard** – "highly pathogenic" used as part of the formal
> disease name (HPAI) is **Neutral** unless further alarmist cues appear.

### Question Q2
**Q2: High-Potency Verb/Metaphor**
Does the author or a quoted source employ a high-potency verb (e.g., 'ravaged,' 'skyrocketed,' 'crippling') or a potent metaphor (e.g., 'ticking time-bomb,' 'nightmare scenario') to describe the event or its impacts, where such language actively frames the situation alarmingly, as detailed in the rules?

**Outcome:**
**Outcome when Yes :** Label = Alarmist
**Outcome when No  :** Return `{ "answer":"no", "rationale": … }`

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Containment override reminder** – If the sentence already contains a containment verb (cull, slaughter …) **do not** fire Q2. Let it drop to Q3, which handles the scale rule.

**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**
* Authorial use of vivid, active verbs or metaphors to describe the spread or impact of a threat, especially when combined with its scale or severity, thereby emphasizing its uncontrolled, rapid, or overwhelming nature. Example: Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)
* Superlative **or intensifier** preceding a **harm noun**
  (mortality, losses, disaster, outbreak, crisis, toll, etc.)
  communicates scale the same way a superlative does; treat it as
  Alarmist under Q2 unless a higher‑precedence cue fires.

**Alarmist - Examples:**
* "The economic impact of the subject on the agricultural sector is a ticking time-bomb for food security," said the analyst. (Alarmist → The analyst's quote uses a potent metaphor "ticking time-bomb," framing the economic impact with fear/urgency.)
* Author: "Political inaction is steering us towards a catastrophic crisis related to the subject." (Alarmist → Author's framing of political aspect through loaded language like "catastrophic crisis," assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* **Example (Author-driven, vivid metaphor & intensifier):**
  * Author: "The virus is a raging inferno, tearing through populations with terrifying speed, leaving devastation in its wake."
  * Reasoning: "Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses vivid metaphor 'raging inferno,' 'tearing through,' 'terrifying speed,' and 'devastation in its wake.' Decisive cues: 'raging inferno,' 'terrifying speed'."
* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: "The disease ravaged poultry flocks across three states, leading to immense economic losses." (Alarmist → 'Ravaged' + 'across three states' + 'immense economic losses' create a strong alarmist frame).
* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: "Confirmed cases soared past one million, overwhelming healthcare systems." (Alarmist → 'Soared past one million' + 'overwhelming healthcare systems' creates a strong alarmist frame).

**Few-Shot Exemplars:**
| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Alarmist – High-potency verb** | "An outbreak ravaged farms across three states." | **Alarmist** | "ravaged" (vivid, destructive verb) |
| **Alarmist – Vivid symptom verb** | "Ducks **writhed on the ground**, convulsing before death." | **Alarmist** | "writhed", "convulsing" |
| **Alarmist – Superlative-negative-noun** | "The H5N1 wave is now considered the most expensive animal-health disaster in U.S. history." | **Alarmist** | "most expensive...disaster" (superlative + negative noun) |
| **Alarmist – Critical alert phrase** | "State authorities remain on high alert for new cases." | **Alarmist** | "on high alert" (critical alert phrase) |
| **Neutral – price trend** | "Egg prices have been *trending sharply higher* in recent weeks." | **Neutral** | ordinary price verb |

**Boundary guard:** If the verb is "hit / hitting / swept / surged" but the segment gives no numbers, adjectives or metaphors that convey magnitude, treat it as Neutral. Alarmist fires only when a concrete scale/impact phrase is coupled.

**⚠ Context caveat for "soaring/soared/soar":**  
Treat "amid **soaring inflation**" or any usage where *soaring* modifies a **background, macro context** (inflation, interest-rates, temperatures, etc.) as **contextual — ignore for Alarmist coding**.  
Only count it when the vivid verb modifies a **direct impact noun** of the threat (cases, prices, losses, deaths, production, shortages …).

**⚠ Emotional reactions alone ≠ vivid language:** Simple emotional descriptors without vivid verbs/metaphors stay Neutral.
- ✗ "very sad" (bare emotion)
- ✓ "devastating heartbreak" (vivid + emotion)

→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: The region was severely hit by the virus, resulting in record losses.
## Question: Does the author/source use moderate verbs paired with significant scale/impact information?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"'severely hit' with 'record losses' combines moderate verb with explicit large-scale impact."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: The outbreak hit several farms in the area.
## Question: Does the author/source use moderate verbs paired with significant scale/impact information?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'hit several farms' lacks specific scale/impact details to confirm alarmist framing."}

# NO example (moderate verb + vague impact → Neutral)
## Input Segment: The outbreak is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down.

=== USER TASK ===
### Segment (StatementID: {{statement_id}})
{{segment_text}}

### Question Q3
**Q3: Moderate Verbs + Scale/Impact**
Does the author or a quoted source use a 'moderate verb' (e.g., 'swept across,' 'hard hit,' 'soared,' 'plummeted') AND is this verb explicitly paired with information detailing significant scale or impact (e.g., 'millions culled,' 'record losses,' 'overwhelming systems'), as detailed in the rules?

**🔍 Q3 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
<!-- Q3.1 -->
| **Moderate Verb (past-tense)** **+ Scale** | "swept across + millions culled," "hard hit + record losses," "soared + overwhelming systems," **"spiked + record‑high prices," "peaked + doubled costs," "jumped + 27 percent,"** | ✓ |
<!-- Q3.2 -->
| **Moderate Verb (past-tense)** **+ Quantity** | "surged + 50 % increase," "plummeted + largest decline," "hit + thousands affected" | ✓ |
| **Moderate Verb (present/future/plan)** *(e.g. "**planning to cull**", "could hit")* | → **Neutral** |

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Alarmist. No → Proceed to Q4.

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Containment override reminder** – If the sentence already contains a containment verb (cull, slaughter …) **do not** fire Q3. The containment rule handles the scale separately.

**Alarmist - Examples:**
* Author: "The region was severely hit by the virus, resulting in record losses." (Alarmist → Author's use of "severely hit" and "record losses" to describe large-scale harm, assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* Author: 'From Wyoming to Maine, the highly contagious bird flu swept across farms and backyard flocks, prompting millions of chickens and turkeys to be culled.' (Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: "The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%." (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).
* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: "Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds." (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').

**Boundary Requirements:**
1. Verb **must appear in the approved list / regex**.  
2. The scale indicator may sit in a *tight* follow‑on clause joined by
   semicolon, dash or full stop **when the meaning is contiguous**
   (e.g. "plummeted — a 50 % drop in one week").  Use judgment: if a
   human instantly links the two, accept it.  Otherwise require same
   sentence. Generic phrases like "supplies are down / have dropped" are **not enough**.
3. Must denote realised impact (not a plan or hypothetical).
4. Plain outcome verbs (*killed, died, affected, reported*) are excluded—Neutral unless other cues fire.
5. **Containment override (strict).** If the same sentence contains a
   containment verb (*culled, destroyed, euthanised, depopulated*) the
   clause is **Neutral**, even when preceded by *swept, hit, surged* or a
   numeric scale; Alarmist fires only when an **additional** vivid verb or
   metaphor appears.
6. Sentences about **financial or trade metrics** (exports, imports, sales, production) are treated as factual price/metric reporting → Neutral, not Alarmist here.

**Examples of Scale/Impact Indicators:**
- Numerical quantities: "millions," "thousands," "50%," "record numbers"
- Comparative terms: "largest," "highest," "most severe," "unprecedented"
- Impact descriptors: "overwhelming," "devastating losses," "widespread damage"

> **New aspect guard.** The moderate-verb must denote **realised impact** – NOT merely an intention or hypothetical.  

**Clarification** — Containment actions  
Containment verbs ("were/was culled, destroyed, euthanized, depopulated") are **Neutral even with large numbers** *unless* the author adds additional vivid or emotive language (e.g., "brutally destroyed 3 million birds").

► NEW NOTE – 2025-06-18
Containment verbs (culled, euthanised, destroyed, depopulated) **always neutralise** a preceding ModerateVerb + Scale pattern. Do NOT fire Q3 unless an additional vivid/emotive cue is present.

**⚠ Containment-Override Exception:**
The containment-override is **suspended** if the scale is described with extreme language (e.g., "brutally destroyed 3 million", "devastating culling of millions"). In such cases, Q3 can still fire for the extreme framing of the scale itself.
