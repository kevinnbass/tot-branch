No. Is there a moderate verb paired with scale? No, because the verb is not on the list. I also consider other rules.

Q3, as I recall, wants me to identify if there's a \""moderate verb\"" from that specific list, paired with some explicit information about \""scale or impact.\""\n\nFirst, I quickly scanned the text and identified the potential candidates: \""deaths,\"" \""deemed,\"" and \""sparking.\"" Right away, I'm noting that \""deaths\"" is a noun and \""deemed\"" isn't on the moderate verb list. \""Sparking\"" is interesting, though \u2013 it's a psychological verb.\n\nNow, according to the rule for psychological verbs, \""sparking\"" is neutral unless it's paired with something very specific: either a vivid intensifier of public reaction (like \""mass panic\"") or a concrete scale of *realised harm*. I see that it's linked to \""a federal investigation,\"" which, while significant, isn't a scale of realised harm. It's an action in response, not the direct impact itself. Therefore, \""sparking\"" seems neutral here.\n\nNext, I have to look for that explicit \""scale or impact.\"" \""Dozens of seals\"" is a quantity, but is it linked to a moderate verb from *that* list? \""Dozens\"" is modifying \""deaths,\"" which isn't a verb from the target list, so it's not a match. Then, \""'unusual mortality event'\"" is a label. It's not a quantitative scale in the way Q3 is asking about, like \""millions culled\"" or \""record losses.\"" Similarly, \""federal investigation\"" is just an action taken and \""strandings\"" is a description.\n\nSo, am I finding a pairing? \""Sparking\"" is, but \""sparking\"" is treated as neutral here. \""Dozens\"" is linked to \""deaths,\"" which isn't a moderate verb. Based on this analysis, I'm confident in my conclusion: No, this sentence doesn't satisfy Q3. Even though there are elements like \""dozens\"" and \""sparking,\"" the specific pattern of a moderate verb *and* paired scale/impact *as defined* by the tree isn't met. The \""sparking\"" here is neutral, and the quantity \""dozens\"" is paired with the noun \""deaths,\"" not one of the designated verbs.\n""}]"
