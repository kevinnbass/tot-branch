The rationale will be based on the segment reporting the detection but with no forward-looking language.\n""}, {""Q"": 11, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""The quoted phrase \""highly pathogenic\"" is a technical term explicitly excluded from framing cues by the technical-term override rule in Q11. No other quoted or attributed language provides a dominant frame."", ""thoughts"": ""**Analyzing for Framing Cues in a Text Segment (Q11)**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: `A \""highly pathogenic\"" form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).` My task is to evaluate this against Q11 of the decision tree, specifically looking for a dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame conveyed through direct quotes or attributed statements.\n\nFirst, I need to identify any quoted or attributed text. I see that the phrase `\""highly pathogenic\""` is attributed to the USDA. Now, the crucial part: does this attribution provide a clear framing cue? I need to consult the Q11 rule, and thankfully, it has a specific provision for terms like this. It states that terms such as *\""highly pathogenic\""* are exempt if they're part of a whitelisted biomedical collocation. The rationale is that these are treated as neutral, technical terms, and not intended to be \""framing cues\"".\n\nSince the cited text is `\""highly pathogenic\""`, it matches exactly with the exemption. Therefore, this quote does not provide an Alarmist or Reassuring frame.  My conclusion for Q11 is \""no.\""  The segment does not contain a quoted source that provides a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame. I'll proceed to Q12, even though I've only needed to answer the current question. I need to output this as a JSON object with the rationale I just went through.\n""}, {""Q"": 12, ""answer"": ""yes"", ""rationale"": ""The segment reports a factual detection and classification ('highly pathogenic' is a technical term) from an official source using neutral language. No explicit framing cues remain."", ""thoughts"": ""**Q12 Analysis: Neutral Framing Confirmed**\n\nOkay, so I've gone through the usual 11 questions, and now I'm at Q12. The text segment is: \""A 'highly pathogenic' form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\""\n\nMy job now is to determine if, after all the other questions, there are *no* remaining explicit framing cues and the presentation is purely factual.  If so, it's a Neutral frame by default.\n\nLooking at it closely, there's nothing jumping out at me as an alarmist or reassuring cue that wasn't covered in previous steps. I mean, \""highly pathogenic\"" *sounds* serious, right? But the \""Bedrock Principle\"" and the guard for technical terms clearly state that this is a technical classification. It's not functioning as an intensifier or a framing cue; it's simply a factual descriptor from the USDA.  \""Bird flu,\"" \""detected,\"" \""backyard flock,\"" \""Suffolk County, New York\"" -- all factual, locational, and descriptive. And \""according to the USDA\"" is simply an attribution.\n\nI've already run through Q1 through Q11. There are no intensifiers (Q1), no vivid verbs depicting impact (Q2), no moderately negative verbs with alarming metrics (Q3), no explicit calming language (Q4), no bare negation (Q5). No capability statements (Q6) and no framing through sources (Q7-Q11).\n\nMy pattern recognition table for Q12 also confirms this. \""Technical Descriptions\"" are classified as Neutral and that fits this perfectly.  The segment reports a factual event: the detection of a severe virus strain. That event is presented using purely factual and descriptive language, without any linguistic choices intended to amplify alarm or offer reassurance.\n\nTherefore, Q12 is a \""yes.\"" This fits the criteria for Neutral framing. The author, or the source quoted (the USDA), has presented potentially negative information factually.\n""}]"
