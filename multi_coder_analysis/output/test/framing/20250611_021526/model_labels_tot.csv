Q11 focuses on whether the text segment contains any *dominant* Alarmist or Reassuring frame signaled by a direct quote or attributed statement. In other words, is there quoted or attributed language that *explicitly* uses framing cues \u2013 either positive or negative, alarmist or reassuring?\n\nLooking at the segment:  `A \""highly pathogenic\"" form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).`  I immediately identify that the phrase `\""highly pathogenic\""` is attributed to the USDA. This looks promising. Now, I need to determine if this phrase acts as an alarmist or reassuring frame.\n\nHowever, Q11 is *smart*. The instructions include a technical-term override, which gives me pause. It tells me to ignore the cue if the adjective is immediately preceded (\u2264 3 tokens) by whitelisted biomedical collocations such as *\""highly pathogenic\""*. Bingo! My phrase matches the override exactly.  The rationale states that Q1's technical-term guard has a higher precedence and treats these as neutral taxonomy, not intensification.\n\nTherefore, because the cited text contains only the technical term \""highly pathogenic\"", and because this has been classified as neutral in this context, the segment *doesn't* offer a dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame via a quote or attributed statement. My answer to Q11 is \""no\"". This means I would move on to Q12 if I were still working through the decision tree.\n""}, {""Q"": 12, ""answer"": ""yes"", ""rationale"": ""The segment reports a factual detection and classification ('highly pathogenic' is a technical term) from an official source using neutral language. No explicit framing cues remain."", ""thoughts"": ""**My Assessment: Neutral Framing**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants me to classify this segment based on my 12-step decision tree, starting at Q12. Essentially, I need to double-check if I missed any Alarmist or Reassuring cues in the previous steps.  Given my expertise, this should be straightforward.\n\nHere's the segment: `A \""highly pathogenic\"" form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).`\n\nMy initial instinct, and I confirmed it through Q1-Q11, is that this is *Neutral*.  Now I need to ensure there are no lingering framing cues.\n\nLooking closer, \""highly pathogenic\"" initially jumps out.  However, and this is crucial, it's a *technical term*, a classification provided by the USDA.  My Bedrock Principle explicitly states that technical terms, no matter how potentially concerning they sound, don't function as intensifiers in this context. It's simply the USDA *classifying* the strain. It's presented factually.  The rest of the segment - \""form of bird flu,\"" \""was detected,\"" \""in a backyard flock,\"" \""in Suffolk County,\"" and \""according to the USDA\"" - are all purely factual descriptions. No vivid verbs, no explicit calming language, no capability statements, nothing to amplify alarm or provide reassurance.\n\nEssentially, we have a factual event \u2013 detection of a *specific* type of bird flu \u2013 reported using neutral, descriptive language. The framing is Neutral, and Q12 is a definite \""Yes\"". My rationale for this conclusion is the absence of framing cues in addition to the use of technical language and factual reporting.\n""}]"
