{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'deadly'.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of \"The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.\"**\n\nOkay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I focused on the provided segment. Then, I quickly spotted \"so\" and \"deadly.\" My task was to determine if an intensifier or comparative directly modifies a risk-adjective. \"So\" clearly modifies \"deadly,\" and from my understanding of the rules, \"so\" is an intensifier, and \"deadly\" is indeed a risk-adjective. This creates the \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj\" pattern. Since this is a direct match, according to the Q1 Pattern Recognition Table and the Precedence rules, this pattern falls under Alarmist language, and is Precedence #1. Therefore, the answer is yes. The decisive cue is that the intensifier 'so' modifies the risk-adjective 'deadly'."}
