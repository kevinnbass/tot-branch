{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' modifies the risk-adjective 'infectious'.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segments for Alarmist Framing**\n\nMy task was to act as an expert claim-framing coder, focusing *only* on the first stage of a 12-step decision tree (Q1). Q1 specifically looks for the presence of an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\".  If a segment triggered Q1, I classified it as \"Alarmist\" and moved on. Otherwise, I proceeded to the next text segment.\n\nHere's my thought process for each segment:\n\n*   **Segments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10:**  In these segments, I meticulously examined each phrase for intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives. I carefully checked against my knowledge of risk-related terms. In none of these did I find the specific pattern of an intensifier directly altering a risk-adjective. My expertise led me to recognize that terms like \"rare,\" \"highly pathogenic\" (in this context, a technical term), \"large outbreaks,\" \"killed,\" and \"immediate public health concern\" didn't fit the specific Q1 criteria. I could see the presence of cues for questions later in the decision tree, like Q4/Q5, but Q1 was not triggered. For these, I answered \"no.\"\n\n*   **Segment 8:** This was the crucial segment. Here, I found the phrase \"so infectious.\" The intensifier \"so\" was directly modifying the risk-adjective \"infectious,\" which immediately triggered the Q1 threshold. I classified this as \"yes,\" indicating an Alarmist frame. My judgment was based on my firm understanding of the established rules.\n"}
