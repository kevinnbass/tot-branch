#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (auto-appended to every hop)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------
✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**
1. If you answered **"yes"**, STOP processing further questions.
2. Quote decisive cue(s) in the *rationale*.
3. No Alarmist on neutrally stated **bad** facts.
4. No Reassuring on neutrally stated **good / low-risk** facts.
5. First "yes" only – no double hits / overrides.
6. Output must be pure JSON and **nothing else**.

🔧 **Implementation hint** – add a regression test where  
Input: "We are confident our systems are ready." → expect Q5 = yes, Reassuring.

*Re-read this list; fix any violation before sending.*
# 7. If you reach **Q12** and still cannot assign a frame with certainty,
#    return an **Unknown** label:
#        { "answer":"unknown",
#          "rationale":"Q12 reached with no decisive cues; frame unresolved" }
#    Down-stream evaluation will skip these rows.

# === GLOBAL BEDROCK PRINCIPLE (DO NOT DELETE) ===
# You are an expert claim-framing coder following a mandatory 12-step decision tree.
# Your analysis must be grounded *only* in the provided text and rules.
# You will be asked one question at a time.
#
# Bedrock Principle: CODE THE PRESENTATION, NOT THE FACTS.
# The frame is determined by explicit linguistic choices, not the objective severity of the facts.
# A severe fact presented factually is Neutral. A reassuring fact presented factually is Neutral.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  SYMMETRY RULE  (do not delete)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------
#  Alarmist ≠ "any negative fact"; Reassuring ≠ "any positive fact".
#  • **Alarmist fires only when a negative / hazardous fact is explicitly
#    amplified** (intensifier, vivid verb, scale exaggeration, loaded metaphor).
#  • **Reassuring fires only when a positive / low-risk fact is explicitly
#    framed for calm or safety** ("public can rest easy", "risk is *very* low",
#    "fully under control", "only 1 out of 1 000 cases", etc.).
#  • Positive or low-risk facts stated neutrally → **Neutral**.
#  • Negative or high-risk facts stated neutrally → **Neutral**.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Context guard for vivid language
> A vivid verb/adjective that colours a **background condition**  
> (e.g. "amid **soaring** inflation", "during a **plunging** market")  
> is **ignored** for Alarmist coding.  
> Alarmist cues fire only when the vivid language depicts the threat's
> **own realised impact** (cases, deaths, prices, losses, shortages, etc.).

> **Context guard for psychological verbs**
> *Spark, stoke, reignite,* or *raise fears* describe a **public reaction**, not the realised impact of the threat itself.
> Treat them as **Neutral** unless the sentence either  
> (a) uses a vivid intensifier (*“mass panic”*, *“public alarm”*) **or**  
> (b) couples the verb with a concrete scale of realised harm  
> (e.g. “sparked panic **after** 5 million birds died”).
> Plain “reigniting fears of another outbreak” is Neutral.

# Precedence Ladder: If multiple cues appear, the highest-ranking rule (lowest Q number) determines the frame.
# 1. INTENSIFIER + RISK-ADJECTIVE -> Alarmist
# 2. VIVID-VERB -> Alarmist
# 3. MODERATE-VERB + SCALE/METRIC -> Alarmist
# 4. EXPLICIT CALMING -> Reassuring  
#    (Inside Q5 the row order Confidence > Preparedness > Low-Risk > Amplification)
#   • Direct food-safety assurances (“safe to eat/for consumption”) belong here.
# 5. BARE NEGATION / CAPABILITY -> Neutral
# 6. DEFAULT -> Neutral
# **Technical‑term guard is absolute** – "highly pathogenic (avian) influenza"
# and similar taxonomy never functions as an intensifier, even inside quotes.

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.
## Question: Does the segment contain an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"The intensifier 'so' modifies the risk-adjective 'deadly'."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: A highly pathogenic form of bird flu was detected.
## Question: Does the segment contain an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'highly pathogenic' is a technical term, not an authorial intensifier on a general risk-adjective."}

=== USER TASK ===
### Segment (StatementID: {{statement_id}})
{{segment_text}}

### Question Q1
**Q1: Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective**
Does the segment feature an intensifier (e.g., 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely') or a comparative adjective (e.g., 'more,' 'deadlier') directly modifying a risk-adjective (e.g., 'deadly,' 'dangerous,' 'severe,' 'catastrophic') as defined in the detailed rules?

**🔍 Q1 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Intensifier + Risk-Adj** | "so deadly," "very dangerous," "extremely severe," "highly lethal," "frighteningly contagious" | ✓ |
| **Comparative + Risk-Adj** | "more deadly," "deadlier," "more dangerous," "less safe," "increasingly severe" | ✓ |
| **Fixed Lethal-from-Outset Idiom** | "deadly from the start," "deadly from the outset" | ✓ |
| **Base Risk-Adj (alone)** | "deadly," "dangerous," "severe" (without intensifier) | → Neutral |

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**
**Outcome when Yes :** Label = Alarmist  
**Outcome when No  :** Return `{ "answer":"no", "rationale": … }`

| If you see… | Frame | Quick test |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective** | Alarmist | **Any single match is sufficient (Precedence #1)** |
| - so/very/extremely/highly/frighteningly/particularly + deadly/lethal/dangerous/brutal/severe/contagious/virulent/destructive | | |
| - more/less/deadlier/safer/higher/lower + same risk adjectives | | |

**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**
* Authorial use of intensifiers (e.g., 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely,' 'incredibly,' 'particularly,' 'frighteningly') coupled with high-valence negative adjectives (e.g., 'destructive,' 'contagious') to describe the subject or its characteristics. The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)

**Clarification on "deadly," "fatal," "lethal":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, "deadly" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.

**Minimal Pair Examples:**
* **Neutral:** "The virus is contagious."
* **Alarmist (Author):** "The virus is frighteningly contagious, spreading like wildfire." (Cue: 'frighteningly,' 'spreading like wildfire').

**Comparative Minimal Pair Example:**
* **Alarmist:** "Scientists warn the virus is becoming deadlier each season."
* **Neutral:** "Scientists track how the virus becomes more common each season."

**⚠ TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  
A term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. "lethal dose 50").  
**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**

**Few-Shot Exemplars:**
| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Alarmist – Intensifier + adjective** | "The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled." | **Alarmist** | "so deadly" (intensifier + risk adjective) |
| **Alarmist – Deadly-from-outset idiom** | "H5N1 is deadly from the start, vets warn." | **Alarmist** | "deadly from the start" (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom) |

**EXCLUSION — "volatile"**  
When "volatile" modifies *prices/markets/rates* it is treated as an **economic metric** and never triggers Q1.

> **Technical-term guard** – "highly pathogenic" used as part of the formal
> disease name (HPAI) is **Neutral** unless further alarmist cues appear.

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: An outbreak ravaged farms across three states.
## Question: Does the author/source employ a high-potency verb or potent metaphor?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"The high-potency verb 'ravaged' actively frames the situation alarmingly."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: The outbreak affected farms in several states.

### Segment (StatementID: {{statement_id}})
{{segment_text}}

### Question Q2
**Q2: High-Potency Verb/Metaphor**
Does the author or a quoted source employ a high-potency verb (e.g., 'ravaged,' 'skyrocketed,' 'crippling') or a potent metaphor (e.g., 'ticking time-bomb,' 'nightmare scenario') to describe the event or its impacts, where such language actively frames the situation alarmingly, as detailed in the rules?

**🔍 Q2 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **High-Potency Verbs** | "ravaged," "devastated," "skyrocketed," "plummeted," "crashed," "nosedived," "tanked," "crippling," "unleashed," "slaughtered" | ✓ |
| **Superlative + Negative Noun** | "most expensive disaster," "worst crisis," "record outbreak," "record-breaking catastrophe" | ✓ |
| **Critical Alert Phrase**(**same sentence must name a threat: outbreak, virus, flu, risk, danger …**) | "on high alert" (threat can appear **before or after** in ≤ 40 chars) | ✓ |
| **Potent Metaphors** | "ticking time-bomb," "nightmare scenario," "raging inferno," "powder keg," "house of cards" | ✓ |
| **Moderate Verbs (alone)** | "hit," "swept," "surged" (without scale/impact details) | → Neutral |

**Outcome:**
**Outcome when Yes :** Label = Alarmist
**Outcome when No  :** Return `{ "answer":"no", "rationale": … }`

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**
* Authorial use of vivid, active verbs or metaphors to describe the spread or impact of a threat, especially when combined with its scale or severity, thereby emphasizing its uncontrolled, rapid, or overwhelming nature. Example: Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)

**Alarmist - Examples:**
* "The economic impact of the subject on the agricultural sector is a ticking time-bomb for food security," said the analyst. (Alarmist → The analyst's quote uses a potent metaphor "ticking time-bomb," framing the economic impact with fear/urgency.)
* Author: "Political inaction is steering us towards a catastrophic crisis related to the subject." (Alarmist → Author's framing of political aspect through loaded language like "catastrophic crisis," assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* **Example (Author-driven, vivid metaphor & intensifier):**
  * Author: "The virus is a raging inferno, tearing through populations with terrifying speed, leaving devastation in its wake."
  * Reasoning: "Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses vivid metaphor 'raging inferno,' 'tearing through,' 'terrifying speed,' and 'devastation in its wake.' Decisive cues: 'raging inferno,' 'terrifying speed'."
* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: "The disease ravaged poultry flocks across three states, leading to immense economic losses." (Alarmist → 'Ravaged' + 'across three states' + 'immense economic losses' create a strong alarmist frame).
* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: "Confirmed cases soared past one million, overwhelming healthcare systems." (Alarmist → 'Soared past one million' + 'overwhelming healthcare systems' creates a strong alarmist frame).

**Few-Shot Exemplars:**
| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Alarmist – High-potency verb** | "An outbreak ravaged farms across three states." | **Alarmist** | "ravaged" (vivid, destructive verb) |
| **Alarmist – Superlative-negative-noun** | "The H5N1 wave is now considered the most expensive animal-health disaster in U.S. history." | **Alarmist** | "most expensive...disaster" (superlative + negative noun) |
| **Alarmist – Critical alert phrase** | "State authorities remain on high alert for new cases." | **Alarmist** | "on high alert" (critical alert phrase) |

**Boundary guard:** If the verb is "hit / hitting / swept / surged" but the segment gives no numbers, adjectives or metaphors that convey magnitude, treat it as Neutral. Alarmist fires only when a concrete scale/impact phrase is coupled.

**⚠ Context caveat for "soaring/soared/soar":**  
Treat "amid **soaring inflation**" or any usage where *soaring* modifies a **background, macro context** (inflation, interest-rates, temperatures, etc.) as **contextual — ignore for Alarmist coding**.  
Only count it when the vivid verb modifies a **direct impact noun** of the threat (cases, prices, losses, deaths, production, shortages …).

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: The region was severely hit by the virus, resulting in record losses.
## Question: Does the author/source use moderate verbs paired with significant scale/impact information?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"'severely hit' with 'record losses' combines moderate verb with explicit large-scale impact."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: The outbreak hit several farms in the area.
## Question: Does the author/source use moderate verbs paired with significant scale/impact information?

=== USER TASK ===
### Segment (StatementID: {{statement_id}})
{{segment_text}}

### Question Q3
**Q3: Moderate Verbs + Scale/Impact**
Does the author or a quoted source use a 'moderate verb' (e.g., 'swept across,' 'hard hit,' 'soared,' 'plummeted') AND is this verb explicitly paired with information detailing significant scale or impact (e.g., 'millions culled,' 'record losses,' 'overwhelming systems'), as detailed in the rules?

**🔍 Q3 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Moderate Verb (past-tense)** **+ Scale** | "swept across + millions culled," "hard hit + record losses," "soared + overwhelming systems," | ✓ |
| **Moderate Verb (past-tense)** **+ Quantity** | "surged + 50 % increase," "plummeted + largest decline," "hit + thousands affected" | ✓ |
| **Moderate Verb (present/future/plan)** *(e.g. "**planning to cull**", "could hit")* | → **Neutral** |

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Alarmist. No → Proceed to Q4.

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Alarmist - Examples:**
* Author: "The region was severely hit by the virus, resulting in record losses." (Alarmist → Author's use of "severely hit" and "record losses" to describe large-scale harm, assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* Author: 'From Wyoming to Maine, the highly contagious bird flu swept across farms and backyard flocks, prompting millions of chickens and turkeys to be culled.' (Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: "The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%." (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).
* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: "Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds." (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').

**Boundary Requirements:**
1. Verb **must appear in the approved list / regex**.  
2. Must denote realised impact (not a plan or hypothetical).  
3. Plain outcome verbs (*killed, died, affected, reported*) are excluded—Neutral unless other cues fire.
4. Containment verbs (“were/was culled, destroyed, euthanized, depopulated”) are **Neutral even with large numbers** *unless* paired with vivid/emotive language.
5. Sentences about **financial or trade metrics** (exports, imports, sales, production) are treated as factual price/metric reporting → Neutral, not Alarmist here.

**Examples of Scale/Impact Indicators:**
- Numerical quantities: "millions," "thousands," "50%," "record numbers"
- Comparative terms: "largest," "highest," "most severe," "unprecedented"
- Impact descriptors: "overwhelming," "devastating losses," "widespread damage"

> **New aspect guard.** The moderate-verb must denote **realised impact** – NOT merely an intention or hypothetical.  

**Clarification** — Containment actions  
Containment verbs (“were/was culled, destroyed, euthanized, depopulated”) are **Neutral even with large numbers** *unless* the author adds additional vivid or emotive language (e.g., “brutally destroyed 3 million birds”).

### Segment (StatementID: {{statement_id}})
{{segment_text}}

### Question Q4
**Q4: Loaded Rhetorical Question for Alarm**
Does the author or a quoted source pose a loaded rhetorical question that is clearly designed to imply an Alarmist frame, instill fear/urgency, or suggest a worrisome threat (e.g., 'Should consumers worry...?', 'Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?') AND is it distinguishable from a neutral, purely information-seeking question, as detailed in the rules?

**🔍 Q4 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Loaded Questions (Worry/Fear)** | "Should consumers worry...?" "Are we facing a crisis?" "Is it safe to...?" | ✓ |
| **Loaded Questions (Inaction)** | "Are we going to stand by while this unfolds?" "How long can we ignore this?" | ✓ |
| **Neutral Information-Seeking** | "What are the safety protocols?" "When will results be available?" | → Neutral |

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Alarmist. No → Proceed to Q5.

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Examples:**
* **Example (Author-driven, implying worry):** Author: "With new variants emerging rapidly, should humans be worried about the next pandemic?" → Alarmist (if context suggests framing a worrisome threat).
* **Example (Quote-driven, implying disaster):** 'The activist asked, "Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?"' → Alarmist.
* **Critical Distinction:** Carefully distinguish these from neutral, purely information-seeking questions (which are Neutral).

**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**
* Direct questions from the author that use explicitly loaded or emotionally charged language clearly designed to imply an Alarmist frame or instill fear/urgency in the reader.
  * **Example:** **Author:** "With the system collapsing, can anyone truly feel safe anymore?" (Alarmist. Cues: 'system collapsing,' 'truly feel safe anymore?' - rhetorical question implying no).
  * **Non-Example (Neutral):** Author: "What are the safety protocols in place?" (Information-seeking).
* Use of loaded rhetorical questions by the quoted source or author that are designed to evoke fear, urgency, or strong concern by implying a severe problem or a dire lack of action.
  * Example (Author-driven): 'How many more animals have to die before we finally act decisively?' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The rhetorical question uses emotive language 'have to die' and implies criticism of inaction, framing the situation as urgent and severe.)
  * Example (Quote-driven): 'The activist asked, "Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?"' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The quoted rhetorical question uses 'disaster unfolds' to frame the situation alarmingly.)
  * **Example (Rhetorical question from author implying worry):** Author: "With new variants emerging rapidly, should humans be worried about the next pandemic?" → Alarmist (if the context suggests this is not a simple information request but a way to frame emerging variants as a worrisome threat).

### Question Q5
**Q5: Explicit Calming Cue for Reassurance**
Does the author or a quoted source provide an explicit calming cue (e.g., 'no cause for alarm,' 'public can rest easy,' 'situation is fully contained,' 'excellent news and means citizens are very well protected') that directly communicates current safety, control, or significantly minimized present risk, as detailed in the Reassuring frame criteria?

**🔍 Q5 Pattern Recognition Table (expanded):**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Reassuring** |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Direct Safety Assurances** | "no cause for alarm," "public can rest easy," "completely safe," "fully under control" | ✓ |

| **Bare Positive Facts** | "no cases reported," "tests negative," "no problems detected" | → Neutral (unless paired with calming cue) |
| **"Fortunately for consumers …" cue** | "Fortunately for consumers …" | ✓ |

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Reassuring. No → Proceed to Q6.

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Definition: Reassuring** (Key Elements)
Statement, either through a directly quoted source or the author's own presentation, demonstrably employs explicit language, tone, or rhetorical devices specifically chosen by the author or quoted source to actively calm audience concerns, minimize perceived current risk, emphasize safety/control, or highlight positive aspects in a way designed to reduce worry regarding the subject or its impacts. The intent to reassure must be evident in the presentation, not inferred from the facts being merely positive.

**Key Differentiators from Neutral:**
* Neutral reports positive facts; Reassuring adds explicit calming / optimistic amplification **or an intensified *low-risk* judgement about *current human safety*.**
* Neutral uses standard descriptive terms for positive outcomes; Reassuring frames them with active confidence or relief.
* Neutral may state a low risk; **Reassuring explicitly highlights the *very/exceptionally low* risk level to calm the audience.**
* Neutral reports solutions/capabilities; Reassuring links them **directly to present safety for the public/consumers** *or* comes from a recognised public authority.

**Inclusion Criteria (Reassuring):**
* A directly quoted source **or the author** uses explicit calming language **or** an *intensified low-risk evaluation* ("risk is **very low** for humans") that clearly signals current safety/minimised danger.
* Statements that not only report positive facts but also explicitly frame these facts as reasons for reduced concern or increased confidence about safety or control.
  * **Example:** "Vaccination rates have thankfully reached 80% in the target population, a wonderfully high figure that provides excellent protection and means the community is now much safer." (Reassuring. Cues: 'thankfully,' 'wonderfully high,' 'excellent protection,' 'much safer').
* Direct assurances of safety, control, or manageability from the author or a quoted source.
  * **Example:** "Quote: 'We have stockpiled 30 million doses of the antiviral, which is excellent news and means our citizens are very well protected against any immediate threat from this virus.'" (Reassuring. Cues: 'excellent news,' 'very well protected').
**Preparedness cues fire only when BOTH conditions hold (strict guard):**
1. *Speaker is a government or public‑health authority* **AND**  
2. *Capability phrase links explicitly to present public/consumer safety* (≤ 40 chars span) ("…so the public can rest easy", "…meaning consumers are protected").  
Superlative boasts alone ("strongest surveillance program") are Neutral.  
Corporate self-statements lacking a safety link stay Neutral.  
  * **Example (Neutral):** "Tyson Foods is prepared for situations like this and has robust plans in place."

**Minimal Pair Examples for Reassuring vs. Neutral:**
* **Neutral:** "The latest tests on the water supply showed no contaminants."
  * Reasoning: "Reports absence of negative. No explicit reassuring language from the author/source about broader safety."
* **Reassuring:** "Officials confirmed the latest tests on the water supply showed no contaminants, declaring, 'This is excellent news, and residents can be fully confident in the safety of their drinking water.'"
  * Reasoning: "The official's quote explicitly frames the negative test as 'excellent news' and a reason for 'full confidence' and 'safety.' Decisive cues: 'excellent news,' 'fully confident in the safety'."

**⚠️ Important Exclusion:**
* **Neutral (NOT Reassuring):** "The cases do not present an immediate public-health concern, the agency said."
  * Reasoning: "This is a bare negation statement without additional calming amplification."

### Segment (StatementID: {{statement_id}})

### Question Q6
**Q6: 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' for Reassurance**
Does the author or a quoted source use a 'minimiser' (e.g., 'only,' 'just,' 'merely') in conjunction with a 'scale contrast' (e.g., 'one barn out of thousands,' 'a few cases among millions') to actively downplay an event or its significance, thereby framing it reassuringly, as detailed in the rules? (Both elements must be present and work together).

**🔍 Q6 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Reassuring** |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Minimiser + Scale Contrast**(**minimiser token AND explicit denominator must both be present**) | "only one barn out of thousands," "just 3 out of 5 000 samples," "merely a few among millions" | ✓ |
| **Minimiser + Explicit Comparison** | "only affecting a single facility nationwide," "just one case among the entire population" | ✓ |
| **Minimiser without Scale** | "only three samples showed irregularity" (no "out of X") | → Neutral (missing contrast element) |
| **Scale without Minimiser** | "one barn among thousands" (no "only/just/merely/**a single/few**") | → Neutral (missing minimising element) |

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Reassuring. No → Proceed to Q7.

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Few-Shot Exemplars:**
| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Reassuring – Minimiser + contrast** | "Only one barn was infected out of thousands nationwide." | **Reassuring** | "Only...out of thousands" (minimizer + scale contrast) |

**Detailed Requirements:**
For this rule to apply, the statement must contain both:
1. **Minimizing word** (like 'only,' 'just,' 'merely,' 'a single,' 'few')
2. **Explicit or clearly implied contrasting larger scale or context** that makes the minimized number seem insignificant

> **Clarification** A **bare numeral (e.g., "1", "one") is *not* a minimiser**  
> unless it is **preceded by** one of the lexical cues above.  
> - Example (Neutral): "One barn among thousands was infected."  
> - Example (Reassuring): "Only one barn among thousands was infected."

The combination should create an overall reassuring effect about the limited scope or impact of an issue.

**Examples:**
* **Reassuring:** "While there were concerns, only 3 out of 5,000 tested samples showed any irregularity, indicating the problem is not widespread." → Reassuring.
* **Non-Example (Missing Contrast):** "Only 3 samples showed irregularity." → Could be Neutral if the "out of X" contrast is missing and no other reassuring cues are present.

**Guard clause** – If no *minimiser token* **or** no explicit denominator is found, fall through to **Q7 bare‑negation**.

### Question Q7
**Q7: Bare Negation without Explicit Calming Cue**
Does the segment merely state a 'bare negation' (e.g., 'not expected to cause problems,' 'unlikely to affect X,' 'no human cases detected,' 'tests were negative') WITHOUT any accompanying explicit calming cue from the author/source that actively frames this as reassuring about the broader situation, as detailed in the rules?

**🔍 Q7 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Neutral** |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Expectation Negations** | "not expected to cause problems," "unlikely to affect consumers," "not anticipated to impact" | ✓ |
| **Evidence Negations** | "no evidence of transmission," "no human cases detected," "tests were negative" | ✓ |
| **Risk Negations** | "doesn't pose a risk," "will not impact food supply," "not expected to enter" | ✓ |
| **Capability Negations** | "viruses do not transmit easily," "cannot survive in," "does not spread through" | ✓ |
| **Bare Negation + Calming Cue** | "no cases detected, so consumers can be confident," "unlikely to affect supply, keeping risk very low" | → Reassuring |

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Neutral. No → Proceed to Q8.

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**⚠️ Additional problematic phrasings that remain NEUTRAL:**
- "unlikely to affect consumers"
- "no evidence of transmission"  
- "doesn't pose a risk to humans"
- "not expected to cause problems"
- "will not impact food supply"

**Reassurance requires a second clause that explicitly spells out calm/safety.**

**Examples:**
* **Neutral (Bare Negation):** "Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe."
* **Reassuring (Bare Negation + Calming Cue):** "Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe, meaning current health measures remain effective and there's no need for additional public concern."

### Additional example
* "The cases **do not present an immediate public-health concern**." → Neutral (bare negation).

**CLARIFICATION** – "will **not** enter the food system" and similar bare-negation
statements remain **Neutral** unless followed by an explicit calming cue
(e.g., "…so consumers can rest easy").

### Question Q11 (**Quote-presence hard-guard**)
**Q11: Primacy of Framed Quotations – Dominant Quote Check**

Does a directly quoted source within the segment provide a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame (per detailed definitions in `step-0-meta-details` and specific frame definitions) that is not overridden or equally balanced by other quotes or strong authorial counter-framing, as per the "Guidance Note: Primacy of Framed Quotations"?

**🔍 Q11 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **Outcome** |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Alarmist – Dominant Quote** | "extremely concerning and requires immediate action." | **Alarmist** | dominant alarm |
| **Alarmist – Intensified High-Risk** | "definitely considered a period of high risk" | **Alarmist** | intensified risk assessment |
| **Neutral – Bare risk-adj in quote** | "This virus is deadly to birds." | **Neutral** | base risk adjective without intensifier |
| **Dominant Reassuring Quote** | "no cause for alarm," "excellent news," "very well protected" | → Reassuring |
| **Balanced/Mixed Quotes** | "concerning, but viruses do not transmit easily" | → Neutral |
| **Neutral Quotes Only** | "officials are monitoring," "tests are ongoing" | → Proceed to Q12 |

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Guidance Note: Primacy of Framed Quotations (SUPERSEDES PREVIOUS QUOTE RULES)**
**Technical-term override**  
Before deciding that a quoted risk-adjective is Alarmist under Q11,  
**skip** the cue if the adjective is immediately preceded (≤ 3 tokens) by the
whitelisted biomedical collocations:  
*"highly pathogenic"*, *"highly pathogenic avian"*, *"HPAI"*.  
Rationale: Q1 technical-term guard has higher precedence and treats these
as neutral taxonomy, not intensification.

**Preparedness safety-link check**  
When a quote says *"fully/well prepared (ready) to handle/deal with …"* **but** lacks an explicit public/consumer safety link within 40 chars (e.g., "so consumers are safe"), treat it as **Neutral** rather than Reassuring.

Core Principle: If a direct quotation (or a clearly attributed statement from a specific source) within the segment carries a distinct Alarmist or Reassuring frame, the segment's Dim1_Frame MUST reflect the frame of that quotation/attributed statement. This principle applies even if the author's narrative surrounding the quote is Neutral. The frame is determined by the language and tone used by the quoted source itself.

### Question Q12
**Q12: Default to Neutral / Final Comprehensive Check**
After applying all preceding checks, are there NO remaining explicit and sufficient Alarmist or Reassuring framing cues from either the author or any quoted source? Is the presentation of any severe/positive facts purely factual and descriptive, leading to a Neutral frame by default as per the "Default-to-Neutral Rule"?

**🔍 Q12 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Neutral** |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Factual Reporting** | "documented 500,000 job losses," "reported 15 cases," "detected in 3 locations" | ✓ |
| **Technical Descriptions** | "high mortality rate," "R-value of 2.1," "lethal dose 50" | ✓ |
| **Standard Procedures** | "officials are monitoring," "tests are ongoing," "surveillance continues" | ✓ |
| **Neutral Metrics** | "prices rose 5%," "rates declined," "levels increased" | ✓ |
| **Remaining Framing Cues** | Any missed intensifiers, potent verbs, explicit calming language | → Re-evaluate Q1-Q11 |

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Neutral. No → *(This path suggests a cue type potentially missed or a nuanced case. Re-evaluate based on comprehensive Alarmist/Reassuring inclusion criteria not fitting simple top-level questions.)*

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Default-to-Neutral Rule (Strictly Presentation-Focused)**
Heuristic: In the absence of explicit emotional language, specific framing cues (e.g., loaded adjectives, urgent tone, calming words), or a distinct rhetorical tone from EITHER the segment's author OR any directly quoted source within the segment, Neutral is the appropriate code for Dim1_Frame. 

**Crucial Clarification:** This rule applies if both the author's presentation and the presentation by any quoted sources are neutral.

* If a segment reports objectively severe facts, and both the author and any quoted source commenting on these facts use neutral, factual language without added alarmist rhetoric, the Dim1_Frame is Neutral.
* Similarly, if a segment reports objectively positive facts, and both the author and any quoted source use neutral, factual language without added reassuring rhetoric, the Dim1_Frame is Neutral.
* The focus remains on the presentation by the author and by any quoted sources.

**Definition: Neutral** (Synthesized from principles, common pitfalls, and examples)
A segment is Neutral if it presents information factually without significant, explicit linguistic or rhetorical cues from the author or quoted sources that are designed to evoke strong fear, urgency (Alarmist), or to actively calm, reassure, or minimize risk (Reassuring). Neutral framing reports events, facts, or statements, even if objectively severe or positive, in a straightforward, descriptive manner.

**Examples of Neutral Framing:**
* **Severe Fact, Neutral Presentation:**
  * Segment: "The report documented 500,000 job losses in the last quarter."
  * Reasoning: "Neutral. The author reports a severe statistic factually. No loaded language, intensifiers, or explicit alarmist rhetoric (e.g., 'a catastrophic wave of job losses,' 'an economic disaster unfolding') is used by the author to frame this fact."
* **Positive Fact, Neutral Presentation:**
  * Segment: "Vaccination rates reached 80% in the target population."
  * Reasoning: "Neutral. The author reports a positive statistic factually. No explicit reassuring language (e.g., 'a wonderfully high rate providing excellent protection,' 'this achievement means the community is now safe') is used by the author."

**Canonical NON-EXAMPLES:**
* **NON-EXAMPLE for Reassuring (Code: Neutral):**
  * Text: "Despite the health department conducting contact tracing, no further cases of bird flu connected to the case have been reported at the time of writing."
  * Correct Codebook Reasoning: "Neutral. The author reports a positive fact (absence of new cases) using descriptive, neutral language. No explicit reassuring language...is used by the author to actively frame these facts reassuringly."
* **NON-EXAMPLE for Alarmist (Code: Neutral):**
  * Text: "These [characteristics] include a wide host range, high mutation rate, genetic reassortment, high mortality rates, and genetic reassortment."
  * Correct Codebook Reasoning: "Neutral. The author lists factual characteristics using neutral, descriptive language. No loaded adjectives...or explicit alarmist rhetoric are used by the author to actively frame these characteristics beyond their factual statement."

**Further characteristics of Neutral framing include:**
* Factual descriptions of phenomena that inherently possess negative-sounding descriptors (e.g., 'a high fever,' 'a high mortality rate,' 'a rapidly spreading virus') if the author/source does not add further explicit alarmist framing.
* Listing a fatality/damage rate, case/incident count, or R-value/metric without evaluative language or alarming tone from either the quoted source or the author.
* Reporting standard descriptive terms for negative events (e.g., 'outbreak,' 'death,' 'illness,' 'culling,' 'risk,' 'concern,' 'epidemic,' 'potential for X,' 'active outbreaks') without additional explicit alarmist cues.
* Epistemic modals (e.g., 'could,' 'might,' 'may') expressing possibility alone, unless the potential outcome is itself framed with strong alarmist intensifiers or paired with other alarmist cues.
* Technical terms, official classifications, and procedural language reported as factual designations.

**Examples from other Rules that default to Neutral:**
* **Neutral (Capability/Preparedness - Rule C, Q8):** "The agency has developed a rapid deployment plan for emergencies."
* **Neutral (Bare Negation - Q7):** "Not expected to lower production."
* **Neutral (Factual Reporting of Prices/Metrics - Q9):** "Market prices for wheat decreased by 2% this month."
* **Neutral (Speculation about Relief - Q10):** "Experts predict that the supply chain issues could ease in the next quarter."
