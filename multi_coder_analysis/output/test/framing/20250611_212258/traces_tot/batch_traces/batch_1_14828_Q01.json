The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)\n\n**Clarification on \"deadly,\" \"fatal,\" \"lethal\":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, \"deadly\" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.\n\n**Minimal Pair Examples:**\n* **Neutral:** \"The virus is contagious.\"\n* **Alarmist (Author):** \"The virus is frighteningly contagious, spreading like wildfire.\" (Cue: 'frighteningly,' 'spreading like wildfire').\n\n**New Comparative Minimal Pair Example:**\n* **Alarmist:** \"Scientists warn the virus is becoming deadlier each season.\"\n* **Neutral:** \"Scientists track how the virus becomes more common each season.\"\n\n**⚠ TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  \nA term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. \"lethal dose 50\").  \n**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – Intensifier + adjective** | \"The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.\" | **Alarmist** | \"so deadly\" (intensifier + risk adjective) |\n| **Alarmist – Deadly-from-outset idiom** | \"H5N1 is deadly from the start, vets warn.\" | **Alarmist** | \"deadly from the start\" (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom) |\n\n**Regex Pattern  (v2.16.2):**\n```regex\n # Ignore the fixed scientific term \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\"\n \\b(?:(?:highly(?!\\s+pathogenic\\s+avian(?:\\s+flu|\\s+influenza)?))\n     |very|deadlier|more|extremely|severely|so|particularly|frighteningly)  \n     (?:\\s+\\w+){0,3}\\s+\n # Risk-adj list (adding infectious, transmissible) while pruning ECON adjective \"volatile\"\n (deadly|lethal|dangerous|severe|catastrophic|brutal|contagious|virulent|destructive|infectious|transmissible)\\b|\n # NEW (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom)\n \\bdeadly\\s+from\\s+(?:the\\s+)?(?:start|outset)\\b\n```\n\n**EXCLUSION — \"volatile\"**  \nWhen \"volatile\" modifies *prices/markets/rates* it is treated as an **economic metric** (see Q9) and never triggers Q1.\n\n> **Technical-term guard** – \"highly pathogenic\" used as part of the formal\n> disease name (HPAI) is **Neutral** unless further alarmist cues appear.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` \nYou will answer the **same question** (Q1) for EACH segment listed below.\nRespond with **one JSON array**.

  "thoughts": "**My Analysis of Risk Framing in Text Segments (Q1)**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this: I'm focusing solely on Q1, which is all that's needed for this specific task. My goal is to identify whether each text segment contains an \"Alarmist\" frame based on the presence of intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives, or the phrase \"deadly from the start/outset.\"  I'll then build a JSON array as requested.\n\n*   **Segment 1-8, 10:**  In segments 1-8 and 10, after carefully examining each for that key combination of intensifier/comparative + risk-adjective, I found no instances that triggered Q1. The segments discussed safety measures, prevention, and production impact, but didn't contain the specific alarm-framing markers I was looking for. \"Highly pathogenic\" in Segment 8 is a *technical term* and therefore considered neutral in this context, adhering to the Technical-term guardrail.\n*   **Segment 9:** This one was key!  The phrase \"highly lethal\" *does* fit the criteria for Q1. \"Highly\" is an intensifier, and \"lethal\" is a risk-adjective.  This combination immediately flags the segment as an \"Alarmist\" frame.\n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting my analysis:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 1,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives were found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 2,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives were found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 3,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives were found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 4,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives were found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 5,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives were found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 6,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives were found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 7,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives were found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 8,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The phrase 'highly pathogenic' in the context of HPAI is a technical term and does not trigger Q1 unless further alarmist cues are present.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 9,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The phrase 'highly lethal' is an example of an intensifier + risk-adjective combination.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 10,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives were found.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n"
