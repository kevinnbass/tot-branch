The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)\n\n**Clarification on \"deadly,\" \"fatal,\" \"lethal\":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, \"deadly\" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.\n\n**Minimal Pair Examples:**\n* **Neutral:** \"The virus is contagious.\"\n* **Alarmist (Author):** \"The virus is frighteningly contagious, spreading like wildfire.\" (Cue: 'frighteningly,' 'spreading like wildfire').\n\n**New Comparative Minimal Pair Example:**\n* **Alarmist:** \"Scientists warn the virus is becoming deadlier each season.\"\n* **Neutral:** \"Scientists track how the virus becomes more common each season.\"\n\n**⚠ TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  \nA term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. \"lethal dose 50\").  \n**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – Intensifier + adjective** | \"The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.\" | **Alarmist** | \"so deadly\" (intensifier + risk adjective) |\n| **Alarmist – Deadly-from-outset idiom** | \"H5N1 is deadly from the start, vets warn.\" | **Alarmist** | \"deadly from the start\" (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom) |\n\n**Regex Pattern  (v2.16.2):**\n```regex\n # Ignore the fixed scientific term \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\"\n \\b(?:(?:highly(?!\\s+pathogenic\\s+avian(?:\\s+flu|\\s+influenza)?))\n     |very|deadlier|more|extremely|severely|so|particularly|frighteningly)  \n     (?:\\s+\\w+){0,3}\\s+\n # Risk-adj list (adding infectious, transmissible) while pruning ECON adjective \"volatile\"\n (deadly|lethal|dangerous|severe|catastrophic|brutal|contagious|virulent|destructive|infectious|transmissible)\\b|\n # NEW (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom)\n \\bdeadly\\s+from\\s+(?:the\\s+)?(?:start|outset)\\b\n```\n\n**EXCLUSION — \"volatile\"**  \nWhen \"volatile\" modifies *prices/markets/rates* it is treated as an **economic metric** (see Q9) and never triggers Q1.\n\n> **Technical-term guard** – \"highly pathogenic\" used as part of the formal\n> disease name (HPAI) is **Neutral** unless further alarmist cues appear.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` \nYou will answer the **same question** (Q1) for EACH segment listed below.\nRespond with **one JSON array**.

  "thoughts": "**My Expert Assessment of Risk Framing in News Segments**\n\nOkay, I've received these text segments and my task is clear: I need to act as a claim-framing expert, specifically focusing on the first step of a 12-step decision tree (Q1).  I'm looking for *Alarmist* framing cues, specifically an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.  I have to adhere rigorously to the specified guidelines: the Bedrock Principle, Symmetry Rule, Context Guard, Precedence Ladder, and, crucially, the Detailed Rules for Q1.  Technical terms require special handling.  I also understand that \"highly pathogenic\" is neutral unless combined with other cues, and \"volatile\" is handled differently for economic contexts.\n\nSo, I meticulously analyzed each segment.  For each, I scanned for that specific pattern: an intensifying word (like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or \"significantly\") or a comparative adjective (like \"worse\" or \"more dangerous\") *directly* modifying a risk-adjective (like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" or \"severe\").  My analysis was precise.\n\n*   **Segment 1:** The phrase \"strongest AI surveillance program\" was tempting, but \"strongest\" modifies a capability, not a risk. \"Immediate public health concern\" also didn't quite fit. It negates concern (Q4 is a possibility), which is the *opposite* of what I'm looking for. Q1 is only about intensification of risk.\n\n*   **Segment 2:** \"Spreading\" and other vivid verbs are interesting, but they belong to the next question, Q2.  I’m solely focused on intensifiers in this initial analysis.\n\n*   **Segment 3:** Straightforward: no matching pattern.\n\n*   **Segment 4:** \"Not impossible\" is a double negative, indicating possibility, which is not an intensifier. \"Pretty rare\" is tricky. \"Pretty\" is an intensifier, but \"rare\" signifies *low* risk, which Q1 is not looking for.\n\n*   **Segments 5 & 6:**  No sign of Q1's specific pattern.\n\n*   **Segment 7:** \"Not pose a risk\" is another clear indicator of *low* risk – potentially a Reassuring frame (Q4), but again, not Q1.\n\n*   **Segment 8:** \"Extremely low\".  While \"extremely\" is an intensifier, \"low\" is the *opposite* of a risk adjective. This is a subtle point, but a critical distinction.\n\n*   **Segments 9 & 10:** No matches.\n\nIn every case, after close scrutiny, the answer to Q1 was \"no\".  I am now ready to present the single JSON array as instructed, which will include `segment_id`, the answer (always \"no\" in this case), and a clear and concise rationale.\n"
