The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist.

  "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Alarmist Framing**\n\nMy task is to meticulously evaluate ten text segments based on a very specific criterion: detecting *alarmist* framing, as defined by the presence of certain linguistic cues. Specifically, I am focusing solely on **Question Q1**, which acts as the first step in a larger decision tree. Q1 centers on identifying intensifiers or comparative adjectives that directly modify risk-adjectives, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\" If Q1 yields a \"yes\", the segment is immediately flagged as exhibiting an alarmist frame; otherwise, I proceed to the next segment (though in this exercise, I'm only focusing on Q1). My analysis is guided by several key principles: the Bedrock Principle (prioritizing code presentation), the Symmetry Rule (ensuring consistent application), the Context Guard (carefully interpreting vivid language), the Precedence Ladder (using specific cues), and a Technical-term guard (being careful with domain-specific terms).\n\nHere's my thought process for each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** I carefully scanned the text for any intensifiers (like \"very\", \"extremely\", \"so\") or comparatives (like \"more\", \"less\") modifying a word indicating risk or concern. I also looked for the \"deadly from the start/outset\" idiom. Neither were present. While \"immediate\" was used, it's a descriptor of *timing*, not an intensifier in the Q1 sense, and therefore, this segment *does not* meet the criteria for Q1.\n\n*   **Segment 2:** This segment details significant impacts, specifically the killing of millions of birds. However, I remained focused on Q1. Again, there were no intensifiers/comparatives modifying risk-adjectives and no \"deadly from the start/outset\". The content is descriptive, not framing.\n\n*   **Segment 3:** Similar to segment 2, this section presents factual economic impacts. While the price increases (\"soar\") might seem dramatic, I considered them within the Context Guard, as they relate to economic metrics rather than direct impacts of the threat. The core Q1 question remains: Does it use an intensifier/comparative with a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom? It doesn't.\n\n*   **Segment 4:** I scrutinized the segment for the same Q1 criteria. I noted that \"significant\" modifies \"losses,\" but \"significant\" does not serve as an intensifier/comparative. It denotes scale. \"Highly pathogenic\" is present but is protected by the Technical-term guard. Q1 is not triggered.\n\n*   **Segments 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10:** I systematically applied the same Q1 logic to each of these segments. In each case, I found no instances of the intensifier/comparative + risk-adjective pattern or the fixed idiom. The descriptive language does not meet Q1.\n\nIn summary, across all ten segments, my analysis consistently led to a \"no\" answer for Q1. I have adhered to the instructions and applied the specific criteria as instructed.\n\nHere is the JSON output requested:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 1,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No Q1 pattern match.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 2,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No Q1 pattern match.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 3,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No Q1 pattern match.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 4,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No Q1 pattern match.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 5,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No Q1 pattern match.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 6,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No Q1 pattern match.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 7,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No Q1 pattern match.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 8,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No Q1 pattern match.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 9,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No Q1 pattern match.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 10,\n    \""
