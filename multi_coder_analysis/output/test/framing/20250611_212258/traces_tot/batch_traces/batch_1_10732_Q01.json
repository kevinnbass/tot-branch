The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)\n\n**Clarification on \"deadly,\" \"fatal,\" \"lethal\":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist.

  "thoughts": "**Initial Assessment: Alarmist Frame Detection (Q1)**\n\nAlright, here's the breakdown of my analysis, focusing solely on the presence of intensifiers/comparatives modifying risk adjectives or the specific idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\" My goal is to determine if each text segment exhibits an Alarmist frame based on this criteria alone.\n\nI've meticulously reviewed each segment, sticking rigorously to the defined rules. For each, I looked for intensifiers like \"so,\" \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"highly,\" and comparatives like \"more\" or \"less\" directly preceding any risk adjectives from the defined list (deadly, lethal, dangerous, severe, catastrophic, brutal, contagious, virulent, destructive, infectious, transmissible). I also checked for the idiom. I carefully ignored instances of \"highly pathogenic\" when it was clearly used as part of the technical description of a disease strain (HPAI). Similarly, \"volatile\" modifying economic terms was ignored.\n\nAfter a thorough examination of all ten segments, my conclusion is that none of them trigger an \"Alarmist\" frame based on these criteria. Each segment either presents factual descriptions of events or economic data, without employing the specific linguistic markers I was looking for. \"Highly pathogenic\" was present, but was evaluated in its technical context and not as a trigger.\n\nHere's the JSON output reflecting my findings:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_4_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers/comparatives modifying risk adjectives or 'deadly from the start/outset'.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_5_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers/comparatives modifying risk adjectives or 'deadly from the start/outset'.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_6_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers/comparatives modifying risk adjectives or 'deadly from the start/outset'.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_7_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers/comparatives modifying risk adjectives or 'deadly from the start/outset'.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_8_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers/comparatives modifying risk adjectives or 'deadly from the start/outset'. 'Rising' inflation is a background condition.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_9_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers/comparatives modifying risk adjectives or 'deadly from the start/outset'.

Based on the rules, no further analysis (Q2 onwards) is necessary for these segments.\n"
