The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)\n\n**Clarification on \"deadly,\" \"fatal,\" \"lethal\":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, \"deadly\" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.\n\n**Minimal Pair Examples:**\n* **Neutral:** \"The virus is contagious.\"\n* **Alarmist (Author):** \"The virus is frighteningly contagious, spreading like wildfire.\" (Cue: 'frighteningly,' 'spreading like wildfire').\n\n**New Comparative Minimal Pair Example:**\n* **Alarmist:** \"Scientists warn the virus is becoming deadlier each season.\"\n* **Neutral:** \"Scientists track how the virus becomes more common each season.\"\n\n**⚠ TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  \nA term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. \"lethal dose 50\").  \n**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – Intensifier + adjective** | \"The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.\" | **Alarmist** | \"so deadly\" (intensifier + risk adjective) |\n| **Alarmist – Deadly-from-outset idiom** | \"H5N1 is deadly from the start, vets warn.\" | **Alarmist** | \"deadly from the start\" (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom) |\n\n**Regex Pattern  (v2.16.2):**\n```regex\n # Ignore the fixed scientific term \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\"\n \\b(?:(?:highly(?!\\s+pathogenic\\s+avian(?:\\s+flu|\\s+influenza)?))\n     |very|deadlier|more|extremely|severely|so|particularly|frighteningly)  \n     (?:\\s+\\w+){0,3}\\s+\n # Risk-adj list (adding infectious, transmissible) while pruning ECON adjective \"volatile\"\n (deadly|lethal|dangerous|severe|catastrophic|brutal|contagious|virulent|destructive|infectious|transmissible)\\b|\n # NEW (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom)\n \\bdeadly\\s+from\\s+(?:the\\s+)?(?:start|outset)\\b\n```\n\n**EXCLUSION — \"volatile\"**  \nWhen \"volatile\" modifies *prices/markets/rates* it is treated as an **economic metric** (see Q9) and never triggers Q1.\n\n> **Technical-term guard** – \"highly pathogenic\" used as part of the formal\n> disease name (HPAI) is **Neutral** unless further alarmist cues appear.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` \nYou will answer the **same question** (Q1) for EACH segment listed below.\nRespond with **one JSON array**.

  "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text for Risk Claim Framing**\n\nOkay, I've got the task. I need to act as an expert claim-framing coder, essentially a linguistic analyst specializing in identifying specific patterns related to risk communication. My goal is to apply a 12-step decision tree to a series of text segments, starting with Question 1 (Q1). Q1 focuses on identifying intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly modifying a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\" My output will be a single JSON array containing objects for each segment, indicating \"yes\" or \"no\" for Q1 and a rationale.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\n*   **Segment 1:** \"As early as last year, the U.S.D.A. warned of the likelihood of an outbreak of the avian flu and emphasized a hardening of 'biosecurity' measures to protect flocks of chickens and turkeys.\" I'm looking for the Q1 pattern. \"Likelihood of an outbreak\" doesn't fit – \"likelihood\" isn't an intensifier, and \"outbreak\" isn't the right kind of adjective. \"Hardening of biosecurity\" also misses the mark. So, **no** for this one.\n\n*   **Segment 2:** \"Biosecurity measures include limiting access to the flocks and requiring farm workers to practice strict hygiene measures like wearing disposable boots and coveralls.\" Scanning for the pattern. \"Strict hygiene\" looks promising, but \"hygiene\" isn't a risk-adjective in the Q1 pattern, so it's a **no**.\n\n*   **Segment 3:** \"Sharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus.\"  I'm searching for the Q1 pattern. The phrase here isn't a direct match, so I'll answer **no**.\n\n*   **Segment 4:** \"So can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting.\" Still looking for the target pattern here, and I don't see anything that qualifies, so another **no**.\n\n*   **Segment 5:** \"At this point, every person producing poultry has to be considering how to improve their biosecurity.'\" This segment also doesn't fit the specified pattern, leading to another **no**.\n\n*   **Segment 6:** \"Is it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys?\" There's no presence of the pattern I'm looking for, so it is a **no**.\n\n*   **Segment 7:** \"Infected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A.\" I'm looking for the required pattern, but it's not present, so a **no** it is.\n\n*   **Segment 8:** \"The virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\" Ah, finally! \"So contagious\" – \"so\" is an intensifier, and \"contagious\" is a risk-adjective I'm looking for. This is a direct match for my target pattern. This segment gets a resounding **yes**. My rationale must reflect the direct match of “so contagious”.\n\n*   **Segment 9:** \"Cases of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in Indiana, Virginia, and Kentucky, posing a likely threat to the United States' domestic supply of chicken and turkey this winter.\" \"Likely threat\" –  \"likely\" isn't an intensifier, and \"threat\" isn't the right type of adjective. **No** for this segment.\n\nI am now ready to construct the final JSON array based on my analysis of each segment.\n"
