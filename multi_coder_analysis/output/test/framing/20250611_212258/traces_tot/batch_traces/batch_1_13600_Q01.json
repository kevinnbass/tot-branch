The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)\n\n**Clarification on \"deadly,\" \"fatal,\" \"lethal\":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist.

  "thoughts": "**Claim Framing Analysis: Q1 Evaluation**\n\nMy task was to act as an expert claim-framing coder, analyzing text segments for alarmist cues based on a 12-step decision tree. Specifically, I focused on Question 1 (Q1), which identifies the presence of an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\" For each segment, I checked for these specific patterns.  The 'Bedrock Principle' of coding the presentation and not the facts was kept at the forefront. The 'Technical-term guard' and 'Context guard' were also considered throughout the review.\n\nAfter carefully examining all ten text segments, I determined that none of them met the criteria for an \"Alarmist\" frame based on Q1.  This was a consistent \"no\" across all cases.  Notable considerations included applying the \"technical-term guard\" to phrases describing avian flu strains, and the careful distinction between intensifiers modifying risk *adjectives* versus other parts of speech (like verbs or nouns).  The \"Symmetry Rule\" ensured consistent application of the criteria, focusing solely on Q1 and not anticipating future questions in the decision tree.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_6_1006_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifiers/comparatives modifying risk-adjectives; no \\\"deadly from the start/outset\\\".\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_7_1006_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\\\"Heavily infected\\\" focuses on state/degree, not risk.
