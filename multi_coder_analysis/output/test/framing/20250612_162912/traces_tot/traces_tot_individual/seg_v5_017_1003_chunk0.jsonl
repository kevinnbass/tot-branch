{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q1 Evaluation: A Clean Bill of Health**\n\nOkay, so I've got this segment to evaluate, and the first thing I need to do is apply Q1 of the 12-step decision tree. Essentially, I'm looking for a specific linguistic pattern: an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nI'm mentally running through the checklist: intensifiers like \"so,\" \"very,\" \"extremely,\" you get the picture. Then the comparatives: \"more,\" \"less,\" and so on.  And, of course, the risk-adjectives themselves: \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" you know the drill. I'm also keeping an eye out for that specific idiom, \"deadly from the start/outset,\" just in case.\n\nNow, let's dissect this sentence: \"The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"  Scanning it... okay, \"hitting\" is a verb, not an intensifier or a risk adjective. Moving on, \"down\" is describing a state, not a risk. \"Strong\" modifies \"demand,\" not a risk adjective. \"Shortages\" is a noun, not a descriptor. And the rest of the sentence is similarly clean.\n\nSo, after a thorough review, the answer is clear: there's no match. No intensifiers, no comparatives, no risk-adjectives, and certainly not the idiom. Q1 is a \"no\" for this segment.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'hitting' is listed as a moderate verb in the Q2 table and boundary guard, not a high-potency verb.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: A Clear \"No\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to evaluate against Q2 of the 12-step decision tree. My focus here is to identify any red flags related to alarmist language, specifically high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative noun pairings, or the phrase \"on high alert\" near a threat word.\n\nLet's break it down: The text says, \"The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nFirst, the verbs. The key word here is \"hitting\". I immediately check my mental list of high-potency verbs: \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" \"skyrocketed,\" etc. Nope, \"hitting\" isn't on that list. It's a moderate verb, and the Q2 criteria clearly state that \"hit / hitting\" alone is a moderate trigger. It is not flagged by Q2 unless paired with details of scale or impact that could be flagged by Q3.\n\nNext, I'm scanning for potent metaphors: \"ticking time-bomb,\" \"nightmare scenario,\" things of that nature. Nothing. This segment is straightforward, not metaphorical.\n\nThen, the superlative + negative noun combination. I'm looking for phrases like \"worst crisis,\" \"record outbreak.\" Again, nothing here meets that criteria.\n\nFinally, the \"on high alert\" phrase with a nearby threat word. Nothing like that in sight.\n\nWhile the text *does* mention impacts (\"poultry supplies are down,\" \"labor shortages\"), the verb \"hitting\" is key. The presence of impact details does not automatically meet Q2. Given the moderate nature of the verb, I would evaluate the overall claim in the light of Q3.\n\nTherefore, after a thorough review, the answer to Q2 is unequivocally \"no.\"\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'hitting' is present tense and not paired with explicit scale or impact details like 'millions' or 'record losses'.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this sentence: \"The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic.\" and need to see if it meets the criteria of Q3. First, I identify \"hitting\" as a potential moderate verb, which is on the approved list. Now, I'm checking for the significant scale or impact pairing. The verb is paired with \"the market,\" but my understanding, based on the examples provided, is that \"the market\" isn't specific enough. We need something more concrete like \"millions culled\" or \"record losses.\" \"The market\" tells *where* the impact is felt, but not *how much* or *how severe*. It's not quantifying the impact.\n\nAdditionally, I'm noting the verb tense is present participle, \"hitting.\" The rule specifies that present/future/plan forms of moderate verbs default to a Neutral classification. So, even if \"the market\" were significant enough, the tense of the verb pushes it towards Neutral. Based on this, I'm concluding that Q3 isn't met.\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no questions, rhetorical or otherwise.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic.\" My task is to evaluate this against Question 4 of the decision tree. Q4 is specifically looking for loaded rhetorical questions designed to imply alarm.\n\nRight away, I can see this is a straightforward statement, a declarative sentence. There's no question mark, and no question-like structure, let alone a loaded one. The segment simply presents a causal chain: a disease is impacting the market because of supply and demand issues compounded by the pandemic. There are no insinuations, no implied calls to action, nothing that resembles a rhetorical question meant to evoke alarm.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q4 is definitively \"no.\" It's on to the next step, which, for this isolated evaluation, just means outputting the JSON.\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes market conditions and supply issues; it contains no explicit calming cues about safety, control, or minimized risk.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: No Reassuring Safety Cues**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with this text snippet and I need to assess it against Q5 of the 12-step decision tree. That means I'm looking for *explicit* calming cues, language that directly communicates that the situation is safe, under control, or that the present risk is significantly minimized. Phrases like \"no cause for alarm,\" \"rest assured,\" \"safe to eat\" – those are what I'm keeping my eye out for.\n\nI carefully examined the text: \"The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"  Essentially, it's about the market impact of a disease, supply issues, and labor concerns.\n\nNowhere in that description do I see *any* of the telltale phrases from the Q5 pattern list.  No reassurances about safety, control, or minimized risk whatsoever.  Therefore, and with my expertise, the answer to Q5 is a resounding \"no.\" The text doesn't contain the explicit calming language we're looking for.\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser word combined with a scale contrast.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Q6 Evaluation: Reassuring Frame Check**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this text segment with a laser focus on Q6 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if this section is leveraging a \"minimiser\" combined with a \"scale contrast\" to build a reassuring frame.  \n\nMy mind's already searching for those telltale words: \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" \"few.\" I'm also primed to catch the accompanying scale contrast, something like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions,\" if it's there.\n\nI'm mentally parsing the text, sentence by sentence. \"The disease is hitting the market...\" - nope, no minimisers or scale contrast here.  \"...poultry supplies are down...\" - still nothing.  \"...due to strong demand and labor shortages...\" - again, nada.  \"...at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic\" - purely contextual, no reassuring frame in sight.\n\nThere's simply no sign of the pattern I'm looking for. No minimiser words are present, and there's no attempt to downplay a negative with a contrasting scale.  Therefore, I'm confident in my \"no\" answer. Q6 is a miss; let's move on to Q7.\n"}

Q7 is looking for \"bare negations\" – statements that deny something without offering any kind of calming cue. It's about spotting those potentially risky \"not this\" or \"no that\" statements without anything to soften the blow.\n\nLet's break it down. The segment describes the disease's impact, poultry supply issues, high demand, and labor shortages.  These are all clearly negative factors, presenting challenges.  However, I'm specifically looking for *negations*. Phrases like \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" or \"no impact\" would be red flags here.  But I don't see any of those.  There's no direct denial of a negative outcome, just a description of the current negative situation.\n\nTherefore, because there's no bare negation, the answer to Q7 is definitively \"no.\" The segment doesn't trip this particular wire. Time to move on (or, in this case, generate the appropriate JSON response for the user).\n"}

Basically, I need to check if this passage is talking about capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, *without* connecting those things directly to current calm, safety, or reduced risk.\n\nI'm reading through this, and the first thing that jumps out is the negativity. We're talking about a disease impacting the market, poultry supplies being down, high demand, and labor shortages. It's a snapshot of a challenging situation.\n\nNow, I'm specifically looking for terms or concepts related to capabilities (like \"can\" or \"able\"), preparedness (like \"plans\" or \"resources\"), hopeful possibilities (like \"could improve\" or \"might change\"), or safeguards (like \"protocols\" or \"systems\").  I don't see anything like that here. This is all about current negative impacts and the underlying context. It's painting a picture of what *is* happening, not what *could* happen, or what someone is *doing* to manage things.\n\nSo, based on that, I'm confident in saying the answer to Q8 is \"no.\" This text doesn't describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, at least not without those things being linked to current calm, safety, or minimized risk. This is the JSON response I'll give:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Q8\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The text describes negative impacts and background conditions: disease impact, supply shortages, strong demand, and labor shortages.

{"Q": 9, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports economic conditions ('poultry supplies are down', 'strong demand') using standard descriptive language without vivid verbs or risk adjectives.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "thoughts": "**Analysis of the Provided Segment Against Q9**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to assess a sentence against Q9, focusing on whether it factually reports economic data using neutral language. Here's my thought process:\n\nFirst, I need to see if the segment, \"The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic,\" actually deals with prices, economic data, or numerical metrics. Yes, it does. \"Poultry supplies are down\" and \"strong demand\" are direct indicators of market activity.\n\nNext, I look for those standard verbs: \"rose,\" \"fell,\" \"increased.\"  \"Are down\" is used to describe supplies. Perfect! It's a clear, straightforward way of indicating a decrease.\n\nThen, I check for \"skyrocketed,\" \"plummeted\" - no dramatic language here. No risk adjectives like \"catastrophic,\" either. The framing is neutral.\n\nSo, the segment's reporting a market condition, \"poultry supplies are down,\" using straightforward language. It attributes the situation to demand and labor issues, along with the broader COVID-19 context.  No embellishment, no alarm bells.\n\nNow, let's circle back to Q9's core question: Does the segment primarily report data using standard verbs, *without* vivid language or alarmist framing?  It sure does.  \"Poultry supplies are down\" reports economic data, using \"are down.\"\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis, the segment meets the criteria of Q9. It's factual, neutral, and straightforward in its economic reporting.\n"}
