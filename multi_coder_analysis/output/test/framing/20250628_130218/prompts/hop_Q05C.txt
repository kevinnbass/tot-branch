Does the segment contain supply assurances (e.g., 'no shortage,' 'ample supply') OR preparedness statements with an explicit public safety link?

**🔍 Q5C Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Reassuring** |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|
<!-- Q5C.1 -->
| **Supply‑Safety Assurances** | **"no shortage of eggs," "ample supply," "plenty of stock," "shelves remain full"** | ✓ |
<!-- Q5C.2 -->
| **Preparedness Calming Cue**<br/>(official source **and** explicit public‑safety link) | "fully prepared to handle," "well prepared for," "ready to deal with" | ✓ |

**⚠️ Preparedness Guard:** Preparedness cues fire only when BOTH conditions hold:
1. *Speaker is a government or public‑health authority* **AND**  
2. *Capability phrase links explicitly to present public/consumer safety* (≤ 40 chars span) ("…so the public can rest easy", "…meaning consumers are protected").

Superlative boasts alone ("strongest surveillance program") are Neutral.  
Corporate self-statements lacking a safety link stay Neutral.

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Reassuring. No → Proceed to Q5D.

**Required marker tokens** – need ≥ 1 of  
`shortage`, `supply`, `stock`, `shelves`, `plenty`, `ample`, `prepared`, `ready`
