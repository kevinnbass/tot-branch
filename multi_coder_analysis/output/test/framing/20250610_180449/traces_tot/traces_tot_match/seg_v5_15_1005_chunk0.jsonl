{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The comparative adjective 'more' modifies the risk-adjective 'deadly'.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment: \"Sometimes those strains [of avian influenza] can get into domestic flocks and mutate into more deadly viruses.\" My task is to determine if it meets the criteria for the first question of this 12-step decision tree for claim framing, focusing specifically on whether it employs an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk adjective.\n\nI need to apply the Q1 rule: checking for `Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective`. Essentially, I'm hunting for phrases like \"so deadly,\" \"very dangerous,\" or \"more deadly.\" My understanding is that risk adjectives, like \"deadly\" itself, are the target.\n\nLooking at the segment, the phrase \"more deadly\" immediately jumps out.  \"More\" clearly functions as a comparative adjective, and \"deadly\" is most certainly a risk adjective. It's a textbook match: `Comparative + Risk-Adjective`.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is definitely \"yes\".  The smoking gun is \"more deadly.\"  Given this 'yes' answer, and according to the precedence ladder, I know this will lead to the \"Alarmist\" frame. I'll need to output a JSON object with the appropriate response and rationale, quoting the key phrase that triggered the classification."}
