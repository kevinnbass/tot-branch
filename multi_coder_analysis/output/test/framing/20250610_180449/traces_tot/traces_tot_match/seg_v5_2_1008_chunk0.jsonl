{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Expert Claim-Framing Code Analysis: Q1 Evaluation**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of the text segment, applying my expertise in claim-framing code:\n\nThe user has tasked me with evaluating this sentence against a 12-step decision tree, starting with Q1. My core objective here is to determine whether this segment contains an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. I'll need to meticulously scan the sentence using my knowledge of the relevant rules and regex patterns.\n\nThe segment provided is: \"To date, the company is only aware of one affected house at a farm in Fulton County, Kentucky, which is one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for the company.\"\n\nMy analysis of Q1 begins. My understanding is that Q1 seeks to identify if an intensifier (like \"very\" or \"extremely\") or a comparative adjective (like \"more\" or \"less\") is directly modifying a risk-adjective (such as \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" etc.).\n\nLooking at the segment phrase by phrase:\n\n*   \"To date, the company is only aware of one affected house...\" - I see no such pattern here. \"Affected\" isn't a risk-adjective according to my established criteria, and \"only\" modifies \"aware,\" not an adjective at all.\n*   \"...at a farm in Fulton County, Kentucky...\" - No intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives here, either.\n*   \"...which is one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for the company.\" - Again, no match. \"Thousands\" is a scale or a metric, not an intensifier.\n\nUltimately, although the segment describes a potential risk (implied by \"affected house\"), it's not expressed using intensified language. Therefore, my expert judgement, based on my understanding of claim-framing code, is that this segment *does not* meet the criteria for Q1. My response to the question is unequivocally \"no.\" The required pattern, specifically the intensifier/comparative adjective + risk-adjective, is simply not present."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the moderate verb 'affected' and provides factual context ('one affected house', 'one of the thousands of farms') without employing high-potency verbs, metaphors, or other Q2 alarmist cues.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Alarmist Language: A Q2 Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I need to analyze this text segment to see if it triggers any alarm bells according to Q2 of the decision tree. That means I'm looking for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert\" (especially when used to frame a situation as particularly concerning).\n\nMy initial scan focuses on identifying those specific patterns. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, I examined the verbs. I was looking for the likes of \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" \"exploding,\" etc. The segment uses \"affected,\" but that's not on the high-potency list. It's a fairly neutral term, and Q2 explicitly flags even slightly stronger verbs like \"hit\" or \"surged\" as only leading to a Neutral rating unless they're connected to scale/impact (which falls under Q3). In this case, \"affected\" is even milder.\n\nNext, I looked for potent metaphors, the kind that paint a dramatic picture. Things like \"ticking time-bomb,\" \"nightmare scenario,\" or \"raging inferno.\" Nothing like that here.\n\nSuperlative + negative nouns? Nope. No \"worst crisis,\" \"record outbreak,\" or anything similar.\n\nFinally, I checked for the \"on high alert\" phrase, especially in conjunction with any threatening words. Nothing there either.\n\nThe language used is factual and actually downplays the situation. It mentions \"one affected house\" and then puts that into the context of \"thousands of farms.\" While it doesn't use explicit calming language (that would be Q4), it definitely doesn't resort to alarmist tactics.\n\nSo, based on this evaluation, my answer to Q2 is definitely \"no\". None of the patterns that Q2 is looking for are present in this text."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the plain verb 'affected' and mentions 'thousands of farms' as context, but does not use a moderate verb from the Q3 list paired with scale/impact describing the realised impact.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Evaluation: A Detailed Breakdown**\n\nOkay, here's my analysis of this text segment based on the Q3 criteria of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if this segment triggers an \"Alarmist\" frame by looking for specific verb usage paired with scale or impact information.\n\nFirst, I examined the verbs.  I cross-referenced the segment's verbs with the list from Q3's regex. I found \"is aware\", \"is\", and \"raise.\" None of these are on the \"moderate verb\" list. That's a key initial observation.\n\nNext, I looked for mentions of scale or impact alongside those verbs. The segment mentions \"one affected house\" and \"thousands of farms.\" \"Affected\" is a simple outcome verb, and it doesn't fit the Q3 criteria for moderate verbs. While \"thousands of farms\" might seem like scale information, it's used to provide context about the company's scope, not to describe the impact of something on those farms. It is not paired with a moderate verb.\n\nTherefore, the segment *doesn't* contain any moderate verbs, from the Q3 list, describing the *realized impact* on a large scale. The segment actually highlights a very *limited* impact: \"one affected house.\" This isn't alarmist. This is just an expression of awareness.\n\nEven considering the SYMMETRY RULE, a low-risk fact stated neutrally is considered Neutral. However, I am bound by the decision tree's priority: Q3. Because the Q3 conditions are not met, the answer to Q3 is \"no.\" I've provided the detailed rationale, as required."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I've got a new text segment to evaluate against the Q4 criteria, which focuses on loaded rhetorical questions that try to whip up alarm. Let's dive in.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the segment: \"To date, the company is only aware of one affected house at a farm in Fulton County, Kentucky, which is one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for the company.\"  It seems straightforward; it's just presenting some facts about the current situation.\n\nNow, let me refresh my memory on Q4. Does this segment use a question, and is that question loaded in a way that suggests alarm, fear, or urgency?  I need to be very precise here.\n\nAnalyzing the segment, I don't see any questions at all. It's simply a factual statement, describing the company's current knowledge.  There are no implied questions either. The segment is just delivering information.\n\nSince the segment doesn't contain a loaded rhetorical question, the answer to Q4 is clearly \"no.\"\n\nI'll output that in the specified JSON format with a brief rationale:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment does not contain a question, rhetorical or otherwise. Therefore, it cannot contain a loaded rhetorical question.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a limited scope ('only aware of one affected house') and provides context ('one of the thousands of farms'), but it lacks explicit calming language or intensified low-risk evaluation required for Q5.", "thoughts": "**Evaluation of Calming Cues in the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I need to assess this text segment, \"To date, the company is only aware of one affected house at a farm in Fulton County, Kentucky, which is one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for the company,\" against the criteria for Q5, specifically looking for explicit calming cues that indicate safety, control, or reduced risk.\n\nMy initial thought is that this segment doesn't quite hit the mark. While it presents a positive scenario – only one affected house – it does so in a strictly factual manner. It doesn't use the kind of language that Q5 is looking for. It's not saying, \"Don't worry,\" or \"The public is safe,\" or \"The situation is under control.\" It's just stating what is currently known.\n\nThe phrase \"only aware of one affected house\" is a straightforward statement of fact.  It's positive in the sense that the impact is limited *so far*, but it's not trying to *explicitly calm* anyone. The context of \"one of the thousands of farms\" further reinforces the sense of limited impact, but again, it's context, not a direct reassurance.\n\nComparing this to the examples I've seen, it's more like a factual statement of limited scope than an explicit calming cue. It's closer to \"No human cases detected\" than to \"The outbreak is fully under control and poses no danger.\"  It might *imply* a low risk, but it doesn't *state* it. I'm looking for the explicit reassurance here.\n\nSo, while the information presented is *positive* in terms of the scope of the issue, it doesn't contain the explicit language of reassurance and control that Q5 demands. I'd have to say \"no\" – it doesn't meet the criteria."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'only aware of one affected house' uses the minimiser 'only', and 'one of the thousands of farms' provides the explicit scale contrast.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Reassuring Frame (Q6)**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. The user wants me to determine if the text segment \"To date, the company is only aware of one affected house at a farm in Fulton County, Kentucky, which is one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for the company\" triggers the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern outlined in Q6, signaling a Reassuring frame.\n\nFirst, I looked for potential cues. I immediately noticed \"only aware of one affected house\" and \"one of the thousands of farms.\" This suggested the presence of the required elements.  Then, I applied the Q6 rule. Does it have a minimiser? Yes, \"only.\" Does it have a scale contrast? Yes, \"thousands of farms.\" Does the phrase structure link them? Absolutely. \"Only aware of one... *which is one of the thousands*...\" is the key phrase. This explicitly places the single instance within a broader context.\n\nTo confirm, I consulted the pattern recognition table. It has examples like \"only one barn out of thousands,\" which is a clear match. The segment's structure mirrors this: \"only one\" and \"one of thousands.\" The \"only\" modifies the single affected house, downplaying its importance by juxtaposing it with the vast scale of \"thousands of farms.\" This creates a reassuring effect, which is the Q6 intention.\n\nI then revisited the detailed requirements. The segment clearly satisfies them: the minimiser (\"only\"), the explicit contrasting scale (\"thousands of farms\"), and the combination reinforces the reassuring frame.\n\nFinally, I checked the clarification details in v 2.16.3.  A bare numeral would not be sufficient. However, the \"only\" functions as the minimiser for that specific number, \"one.\" Then, the phrase continues with the contrasting scale \"one of the thousands of farms.\"\n\nTherefore, based on this thorough analysis, I'm confident that the text segment satisfies the Q6 rule for the \"Reassuring\" frame.  It contains the minimiser \"only\" and a scale contrast, creating the intended effect of reassuring the audience. My output will be formatted as requested."}
