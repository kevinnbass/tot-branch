{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'highly' modifying the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**Evaluation of Text Segment Against Q1 of the Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, I'm analyzing this segment. I need to see if it triggers Q1: an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk adjective. I see \"highly contagious\" in the text, and that seems promising.  Looking at the definitions, \"highly\" is indeed an intensifier and \"contagious\" is a risk adjective. That's a direct match! The pattern is \"Intensifier + Risk-Adjective,\" and \"highly contagious\" fits perfectly.  Since Q1 is triggered, the frame is Alarmist.  I'm stopping here.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment contains the pattern 'highly contagious', which matches the Q1 criterion.\"\n}\n```"}
