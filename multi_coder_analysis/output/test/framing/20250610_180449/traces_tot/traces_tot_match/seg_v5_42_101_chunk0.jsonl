{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question about stopping spread and does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Question: Preventing Virus Spread**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" and I need to run it through this 12-step decision tree. First things first, Q1: Does the segment contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\"? \n\nLet's dissect this. \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" I immediately scan for those key elements.  No \"so,\" \"very,\" \"more,\" \"less,\" none of those.  And the word \"spread\" itself... it's about the action, not the nature of the virus itself, so it's not a risk-adjective.  We're looking for words like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" and how they're being *modified*.  I see nothing of the sort.  And, of course, no \"deadly from the start/outset.\"\n\nTherefore, this question clearly does *not* satisfy the criteria for Q1.  My answer is a definitive \"no,\" because the phrase is about *action* to prevent something, not about *describing* the virus itself using any sort of heightened or comparative risk language, or the specific idiom.  We're on to step two."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking about stopping the spread of a virus and contains no high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 framing language.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against the Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment, \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\". My task is to evaluate it against Q2 of the decision tree. Q2 is looking for specific alarmist language: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert.\"\n\nLet's break it down. The segment is a direct question, clearly focused on finding solutions. The phrase \"What can be done\" immediately signals a problem-solving approach. The core of the question, \"to stop the spread of the virus,\" is a straightforward description of a process. \"Stop\" is a verb, but in this context, it's about *action* to be taken, not a dramatic description of the virus's impact. It doesn't use the intense language of, say, \"ravaged\" or \"crippling.\"\n\nI don't see any of the \"red flags\" Q2 is looking for. No metaphors like \"ticking time-bomb,\" no superlative + negative nouns painting the situation as the \"worst crisis,\" and definitely no \"on high alert\" framing. The \"spread of the virus\" is a neutral, factual description.\n\nSo, according to the criteria of Q2, the answer is a clear \"no.\" The segment doesn't use any of the alarmist framing techniques that the decision tree is designed to identify. My rationale will need to clearly articulate this lack of specific language as the basis for the \"no\" answer."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and contains no moderate verbs or scale/impact details.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text: \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" My task is to evaluate this against Question 3 of the decision tree. Q3, as I recall, is looking for \"moderate verbs\" alongside information that suggests \"significant scale or impact.\" I know this decision tree inside and out, so this should be straightforward.\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on the text itself. Here it is: \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" Simple enough.\n\nNext, I have to mentally run it through the Q3 filter. I know that the 'moderate verbs' are those specific verbs we defined: \"hit, swept, surged, soared, plunged, plummeted, prompted, feared, fearing, were/was culled\". I scan the sentence... nope. Not a single one of those verbs is present.\n\nNow, I shift my focus to the \"significant scale or impact\" component. Does the segment contain any data points, qualifiers, or even implied situations that would indicate widespread impact? Does it mention \"millions culled,\" \"record losses,\" or anything about \"overwhelming systems\"? No. The question is very general.\n\nSince neither the moderate verbs nor the scale/impact information are present, the criteria for Q3 are definitely *not* met. The answer is clearly \"no.\"\n\nI'll formulate my JSON response accordingly, ensuring the rationale clearly explains the absence of both required elements. This is easy, almost too easy. Next!"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The question 'What can be done...' is a neutral, information-seeking question, not a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm or instill fear.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Question Regarding Virus Spread**\n\nOkay, here's how I see this. The user presented the phrase \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" and wants me to assess it based on criterion Q4, specifically whether it's a loaded rhetorical question that implies alarm.\n\nFirst, I parsed the segment. Simple enough: \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" Next, I recalled the definition of Q4. This criterion focuses on identifying rhetorical questions that subtly (or not so subtly) instill fear, urgency, or suggest a dire situation. Crucially, Q4 differentiates these alarmist questions from neutral, information-seeking queries.\n\nNow, I compared the segment to the Q4 definition. The key here is that the phrase is a straightforward question. It's explicitly asking for informationâ€”specifically, *actions* that can be taken. The language is neutral; there's no emotionally charged vocabulary. It doesn't use words like \"crisis,\" \"disaster,\" or imply inaction equals certain doom. It's a request for practical solutions, not an attempt to create a sense of panic.\n\nI then consulted the Q4 pattern table. This segment fits directly into the \"Neutral Information-Seeking\" category. We're looking for strategies, not stirring up fear. The table also provided a non-example that aligned perfectly: a question about safety protocols. It's the same principle.\n\nConsidering these findings, the question clearly does not meet the criteria of a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm. It's a genuine information-seeking query about mitigation strategies. Therefore, the answer to Q4 is \"no\"."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking about actions to stop the spread of a virus. It contains no explicit calming cues or language communicating current safety or minimized risk.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Explicit Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" and I need to assess it based on question Q5 of our decision tree. That means I'm looking for *explicit* calming cues, things that directly communicate present safety, control, or a significantly minimized risk.\n\nMy first step is to mentally run through the Q5 pattern recognition table, specifically the list of indicators we've defined: direct safety assurances, preparedness calming cues, low-risk evaluations (especially with intensifiers), positive amplification, confidence statements, and bare positive facts.\n\nHonestly, as soon as I see the phrase, it's clear none of those patterns are present. It's a question, not a statement. It's asking *how* to address a problem, not *stating* that the problem is already under control or presenting reassurance. There's no \"no cause for alarm\" language, no talk of being \"fully prepared,\" no indication of a \"very low\" risk. It's straightforwardly inquiring about solutions.\n\nTherefore, after thoroughly considering it, the answer to Q5 is definitely \"no\". I'll format my response accordingly."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment asks a question about stopping the spread and contains no minimiser or scale contrast cues.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" Pattern in Reassurance**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the segment, \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\". My task is to determine if this aligns with Question 6, specifically looking for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern within the context of Reassurance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Q6 is all about. It's focused on finding language that minimizes the scope of a problem while highlighting a larger context. This usually means a word like \"only\" or \"just\" combined with a scale contrast, like \"out of millions\".\n\nNow, I look at the segment. Does it contain any minimizers? No, there's no \"only,\" \"just,\" or similar word that restricts the scope. Does it present a contrast, like comparing a small subset to a massive group? Again, no. It's a straightforward question, not a statement of reassurance using the specific pattern.\n\nTherefore, applying Q6 to the segment, the answer is clearly \"no.\" The segment doesn't contain the targeted pattern, and that's the core of my evaluation."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and does not contain any form of bare negation as defined by Q7.", "thoughts": "**Assessing for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" and need to see if it triggers Q7, the one about \"bare negation\" without a calming cue. My first step is to break down the text: it's a direct question.  Now, Q7 is specifically looking for instances where a negative is used - a \"not,\" \"no,\" \"unlikely\" - but in a way that *downplays* the problem. Think phrases like \"not expected to cause problems\" or \"no human cases detected.\"\n\nThis particular segment doesn't fit that mold at all. It's asking about *solutions*, not denying a risk or minimizing a threat. There's no negation present, bare or otherwise. So, for Q7, the answer here is a clear \"no\".\n\nMy next step will be to create the JSON output with `answer: \"no\"` and a short rationale to clearly articulate why this question doesn't align with the patterns Q7 is designed to detect."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment asks about potential actions/capabilities ('What can be done') without linking them to current calm or safety.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Segment \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" against Q8**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants me to assess \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" against Q8. Q8, as I understand it, is looking for segments that describe potential actions, capabilities, or hopeful possibilities, *without* explicitly linking them to a state of present calm, safety, or significantly minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is that \"What can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\" is clearly asking about *potential actions*. It's a question about *capabilities* or *measures* that could be implemented. This aligns with the \"capabilities, preparedness, or hopeful future possibilities\" aspect of Q8.\n\nNow, the crucial question is whether this segment provides *active reassurance* about the *current* situation. Does it say, \"Because of X, the public is safe,\" or \"Risk is low because of Y\"? No. It simply poses a question about what *could* be done. It's focused on potential interventions, not on describing the present state as safe or low-risk.\n\nTherefore, the segment describes the *concept* of actions/capabilities (\"What can be done...\") without providing any active reassurance about the *current* level of risk. This perfectly fits the \"Capability/Preparedness Statement without Active Reassurance\" pattern outlined in Q8.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll answer \"yes\" to Q8. My rationale will focus on the key phrase, \"What can be done,\" and explain how this phrase directly relates to potential actions/capabilities without explicitly reassuring about the present situation. I'll make sure the response is valid JSON and follows all self-audit rules."}
