{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmism: Q1 Confirmed**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment and I need to see if it triggers Q1 in the decision tree. The rule for Q1 is pretty straightforward: it's looking for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective. Essentially, does the language amplify the perceived risk?\n\nI look at the segment: \"The virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\" Right off the bat, I spot \"so contagious.\"  Now, I'm well-versed in the relevant categories. \"So\" is definitely an intensifier, and \"contagious\" clearly falls into the risk-adjective category, like \"dangerous\" or \"lethal.\" It's a risk-related descriptor, making this a classic `intensifier + risk-adjective` pattern.\n\nThis is a direct match to what Q1 is searching for. It's clear that the answer to Q1 is \"yes.\" My next step is dictated: I'm done here. Q1 frames it as Alarmist, so that's the result. I'll need to generate my output in JSON format, as requested, with \"yes\" as the answer and a quote of the cue as the rationale."}
