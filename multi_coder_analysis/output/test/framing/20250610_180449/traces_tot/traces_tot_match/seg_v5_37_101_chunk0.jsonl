{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking for a comparison but contains no intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of the Query Against the Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to evaluate the phrase \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" against Q1 of this decision tree. My expertise in this area tells me that Q1 is all about identifying risk adjectives and how they are modified.\n\nSpecifically, Q1 is looking for three things: an intensifier paired with a risk adjective (like \"so deadly\"), a comparative adjective paired with a risk adjective (like \"more dangerous\"), or a fixed idiom that indicates immediate lethality (\"deadly from the start\").\n\nAnalyzing the segment, I see it's a perfectly valid question about comparison. However, it's missing the key ingredient: a risk adjective, or any intensifier or comparative modifying a risk adjective. The question doesn't use words like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" or \"severe.\" Nor does it modify a risk adjective with an intensifier or use any comparative terms.\n\nTherefore, applying my knowledge of how these decision trees work, the answer must be \"no.\" The segment fails to meet the specified criteria outlined in Q1 because the required pattern of risk adjectives modified by intensifiers or comparatives is absent."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and contains no high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with a text segment: \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" and my task is to assess it according to Question 2 of this decision tree. I know Q2 is all about spotting alarmist framing – looking for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlatives paired with negative nouns, or the specific phrase \"on high alert.\"\n\nScanning the segment, it's immediately clear this is a straightforward question about comparison. It doesn't use any of those vivid verbs that scream \"disaster\" or any hyperbolic metaphors painting a grim picture. I don't see any superlative phrases like \"worst crisis\" or \"most dangerous situation,\" and the phrase \"on high alert\" is nowhere to be found.\n\nGiven this, I have to conclude that the answer to Q2 is \"no.\"  The segment simply doesn't contain the characteristics the rule is looking for.  The JSON response will be a quick \"no\" with a brief explanation highlighting the absence of those specific alarmist indicators.  Next step, per the decision tree, would be to move to Q3, but I'll hold off since my instructions were only to evaluate against Q2."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment asks a question and does not contain any moderate verbs from the specified list paired with scale/impact information.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Evaluation - A Quick Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the prompt \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\".  My task, as I understand it, is to assess this against Q3 of that 12-step decision tree.  Q3, as I recall, is looking for a specific pattern: \"moderate verbs\" coupled with information about \"significant scale or impact.\"\n\nFirst, I had to parse the segment itself. Pretty straightforward, it's a direct question.  Next, the verb - \"compare.\"  Then came the crucial check against the \"moderate verb\" list.  I ran through the list:  `hit, swept, surged, soared, plunged, plummeted, prompted, feared, fearing, (?:were|was)\\s+culled` - none of those are \"compare\".\n\nAfter that, I needed to check for any indication of scale or impact within the prompt.  It's asking for a comparison, but it's not actually *providing* any details about the scale or impact of anything.  It's just posing a comparative question.\n\nNow, considering both factors, Q3 requires *both* a moderate verb *and* scale/impact information. Since the original question contains neither the moderate verb nor the scale/impact information, it's a clear \"no\" for Q3.  I'll package that up neatly in a JSON object with a brief rationale, and the task is complete."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The question 'How do these outbreaks compare...' is a neutral, information-seeking question, not a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Question: A Neutral Inquiry**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My task is to evaluate the phrase \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" against Q4, which flags potentially alarmist rhetorical questions.\n\nFirst, I identified the segment: \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\". Pretty straightforward. Then, I re-familiarized myself with Q4's criteria. It's looking for those loaded rhetorical questions designed to spark fear or urgency, implying a dire situation. I need to differentiate those from straightforward, neutral inquiries.\n\nNow, comparing the segment to Q4 is the key.  \"How do these outbreaks compare...\" is a direct request for comparative data. It's not using emotive language. There's no inherent suggestion of panic, crisis, or an urgent need to act. It's simply seeking information: a neutral request for facts regarding the scale and nature of the current outbreaks in relation to those of the past. It's a question aimed at understanding the context.\n\nI double-checked against the examples and rules. The rules state that neutral, information-seeking questions like \"What are the safety protocols?\" are considered neutral. The provided example \"Should consumers be worried...?\" is given as an example of an alarmist question. It's clear that my segment falls into the former category.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, it's clear that the question is not loaded or designed to instil fear or urgency. It's purely an information-seeking question. I can confidently answer \"no\" to Q4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The question 'How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?' is a neutral information-seeking question. It does not use loaded language or imply an urgent situation, making it distinct from the alarmist rhetorical questions flagged by Q4.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking for a comparison and contains no explicit calming cues or language indicating current safety or control.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Explicit Calming Cues (Q5)**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've been tasked with assessing the text segment, \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\", specifically against Q5 of that 12-step decision tree. I'm looking for those explicit calming cues, the language that directly communicates safety, control, or reduced risk.\n\nI went through the mental checklist, the patterns: \"no cause for alarm,\" \"public can rest easy,\" phrases about things being \"under control\" or \"completely safe,\" and expressions about low risk. I also scanned for those specific phrases like \"rest assured\" and \"situation contained.\"\n\nI re-read \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" carefully. It's a question. It's simply asking for a comparison. There's nothing in that sentence that even remotely resembles the explicit calming language I'm supposed to identify. No reassuring words, no minimization of risk.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q5 is definitely \"no.\" I'm ready with the JSON response."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and contains no minimiser or scale contrast cues.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Reassurance Techniques**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to analyze the provided text, \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" against question Q6 of this decision tree. My task is to determine if it uses \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" for reassurance.\n\nFirst, I need to look for a minimiser, something like \"only\" or \"a few.\"  Then, I'm checking for a scale contrast – something that puts the situation into perspective, maybe comparing it to a larger group or over time. Finally, I'm looking for both elements working together to soften the impact for the reader.\n\nLooking at the segment, I don't see any of that. No minimisers, no scale contrasts, and certainly no attempt to downplay the situation for reassurance. It's just a straightforward question about comparing outbreaks. So, based on my analysis, Q6 is a definite \"no.\"  I'll proceed to structure the JSON with the appropriate answer and rationale."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question and does not contain any statement of fact, including a bare negation.", "thoughts": "**Assessing for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" and need to evaluate it against Q7, which focuses on identifying \"bare negations\" – statements that dismiss a risk without explicitly calming the audience.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the segment. It's a question, which is immediately different from the kind of factual statements Q7 is designed to pick up. Next, I apply the specific criteria of Q7. Does this question contain a direct negation? No, it doesn't. Q7 is looking for statements like \"It's not a problem\" or \"No cases have been confirmed,\" things that *explicitly* deny something bad. The question just asks for a comparison.\n\nSince there's no negation of any kind in the prompt, there's nothing to classify. Therefore, the answer for Q7 is \"no.\"  I'll format this into a JSON object with \"no\" as the answer and a rationale that explains the absence of any negation within the segment."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking for a comparison, not a statement describing capabilities, preparedness, or future possibilities.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating a Segment Against Q8**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this question, \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\". The task is to see if it aligns with Q8, which is all about identifying statements related to capability and preparedness *without* any kind of active reassurance.\n\nMy thinking went like this: First, I broke down the question. It's a simple comparison of the current situation against past events. Does that touch on capabilities, measures, or any of those preparedness elements Q8 is looking for? Absolutely not. It's purely about comparison.\n\nSince it doesn't mention any officials working, any vaccine development, existing systems, or any planned protocols, I quickly determined that the answer to Q8 is definitively \"no.\" The segment doesn't discuss any capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards. It's just a comparative question. Now, I simply need to move on to the next hop and format the response accordingly."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking for a comparison of outbreaks, not reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Q9**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this request to evaluate the segment \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" against Q9. My understanding of Q9 is that it's all about identifying text that *primarily* reports financial data, like prices, economic indicators, or specific numerical metrics. The key here is the use of standard, neutral language; think descriptive verbs and adverbs, nothing too flashy or emotive. We're looking for reporting, not analysis.\n\nNow, this segment is a question, plain and simple. It's asking for a comparison of different outbreaks.  Crucially, it's *not* reporting any financial figures or economic data. There aren't any verbs that scream \"economic reporting,\" no \"prices,\" no \"inflation,\" no \"GDP.\" And definitely no vivid verbs, risk adjectives, or any of that explicit framing Q9 is meant to identify.\n\nGiven all that, the segment clearly doesn't meet Q9's criteria. My assessment is a definitive \"no.\" This one is easy."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question asking for a comparison of current outbreaks to previous ones; it does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment: \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment, \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\", and I need to assess it against that Q10 decision tree question. Essentially, Q10 wants to know if the segment is speculating about things getting better in the future, *without* explicitly grounding us in the present.\n\nWell, this segment is a question, plain and simple. It's asking for a comparison of current events to historical data. It's seeking a factual answer about the present situation *relative* to the past. There's no speculation about a future improvement or easing of the situation here. It's all about historical context.\n\nTherefore, applying my expertise, I have to conclude that this segment does not satisfy the criteria of Q10. My answer to Q10 has to be a clear \"no\"."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a question posed by the author and does not contain a directly quoted source with explicit framing.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Against Decision Tree Question 11**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with assessing a text segment, specifically \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\", against question Q11 in this decision tree. Q11 focuses on whether the segment contains a dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame, but *only* if that frame is provided by a directly quoted source. My expertise tells me this is crucial; we're looking for *attributed* framing, not just any framing.\n\nFirst, I checked for a direct quote. Nope. It's just the author's question. Clearly, it's not a direct quote from any source.\n\nNext, I looked for explicit framing language—Alarmist or Reassuring—that might be coming from a source. Again, nothing. No source is quoted or even referenced. This means Q11 simply doesn't apply here.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response will be straightforward: `{\"answer\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"The text segment does not contain a directly quoted source providing a dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame, thus rendering Q11 inapplicable.\"}` Easy peasy."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment is a neutral, factual question asking for a comparison, with no explicit framing cues.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Framing of the Segment: \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the final step, Q12, the \"catch-all\" to ensure nothing was missed. The user wants me to frame this segment using a 12-step decision tree. The task is to identify any explicit alarmist or reassuring framing cues.\n\nThe segment itself is a question: \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\". Immediately, I see it's a *purely factual question*. It's seeking a comparison – a neutral action. There's no inherent bias in the question itself.\n\nI've gone through my mental checklist: no intensifiers, no dramatic verbs describing impact, no scale exaggeration, no loaded metaphors, and absolutely no calming language. The term \"outbreaks\" is *descriptive*. It's a standard term, not laden with alarmist intent. The presentation is undeniably factual.\n\nTherefore, according to the Q12 rule and the \"Default-to-Neutral Rule,\" since I haven't detected any explicit framing cues and it's a purely factual question, the frame *must be* Neutral by default. My answer to Q12 is a resounding \"yes\" - meaning, it's Neutral. The rationale is straightforward: the segment lacks explicit framing cues, and it's a neutral, factual question."}
