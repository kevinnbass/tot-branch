{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective. 'Soared' and 'ravaged' are verbs describing impact/consequence, not intensified risk adjectives.", "thoughts": "**Initial Assessment: Navigating Q1 of the Decision Tree**\n\nAlright, let's dissect this. My task is to scrutinize the provided text snippet through the lens of Q1 of the decision tree. Q1 is laser-focused on identifying whether an intensifier or a comparative adjective is directly modifying a risk-adjective. In other words, are we seeing something like \"very dangerous\" or \"more severe\"?\n\nThe segment itself is: \"Egg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015.\"\n\nFirst, I notice \"Egg prices soared.\" While vivid, \"soared\" describes an economic effect - the price hike. It doesn't inherently point to the inherent risk of the outbreak itself. That pushes this down the line, potentially into territory covered by Q2 or perhaps Q9, which deal with the descriptive nature of verbs and overall economic impact.\n\nNext, we have \"an outbreak ravaged the United States.\" Now \"ravaged\" is quite evocative. It vividly portrays the consequences of the outbreak. The impact is clear, but Q1 wants direct modification of a *risk-adjective*. This suggests Q2 is a more relevant point for evaluating the text.\n\nSo, let's break down the explicit Q1 requirements. The structure we are looking for is `Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective`:\n- Are there any intensifiers? No. The usual suspects like \"very,\" \"extremely,\" or \"so\" are absent.\n- Are there any comparative adjectives? Nope. No signs of \"more,\" \"less,\" \"deadlier,\" or similar.\n- Are there any risk-adjectives? No direct risk-adjectives like \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" or \"lethal\" are present.\n\nInstead, we see a verb describing an economic consequence (\"soared\") and another vividly describing the impact (\"ravaged\"). Those are not the specific pattern Q1 seeks.\n\nThus, based on my expert understanding of the decision tree's logic, the answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" I'll now move onto the subsequent question, Q2."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment uses the high-potency verbs 'soared' (modifying prices, a direct impact noun) and 'ravaged' to describe the event and its impacts, framing the situation alarmingly.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Alarmist Frame Detected**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to analyze the text segment, \"Egg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015,\" using the Q2 criteria of the decision tree. I'm looking specifically for alarmist framing.\n\nFirst, I scanned for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative/negative noun combinations, and critical alert phrases. I quickly spotted two potential triggers: \"soared\" and \"ravaged.\"\n\n\"Soared\" immediately caught my attention. The model specifically checks for \"soar\" variations followed by an impact noun within a short distance. In this case, \"soared\" is right next to \"Egg prices.\" This is a match! The context of \"soared\" modifying prices fits perfectly. The regex checks out.\n\nThen, I looked at \"ravaged.\"  This verb is explicitly listed as a high-potency verb that always counts.  The text reads \"an outbreak ravaged the United States.\" This is another direct hit.\n\nSince *both* \"soared\" and \"ravaged\" qualify as high-potency verbs under Q2, my answer is a resounding \"yes\" to the question. This triggers the alarmist frame. The process says I stop evaluating further questions and just emit the frame. Q2 corresponds to Precedence #2, which is VIVID-VERB -> Alarmist.\n\nTherefore, the frame is **Alarmist**, and my decisive cues are \"soared\" and \"ravaged.\""}
