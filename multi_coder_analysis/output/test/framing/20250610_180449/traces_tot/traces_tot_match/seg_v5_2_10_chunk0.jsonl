{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'highly pathogenic strain' is treated as a technical term for the disease type, not an authorial intensifier modifying a general risk-adjective, per the technical-term guard rule.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Q1**\n\nOkay, so I'm diving into this text segment to see if it triggers Q1 of the decision tree. Q1's all about catching intensifiers or comparatives directly beefing up a risk-adjective.  I have to stick to the rules, especially the Bedrock Principle and the Symmetry Rule – no exceptions.\n\nThe text is: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\"\n\nAlright, my internal radar is set for the pattern: `(intensifier/comparative) + (risk-adjective)`.  I've got the risk-adjectives and intensifiers/comparatives memorized; I'm practically fluent in them by now.\n\nHmm, I see \"highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza.\"  Now, I've got to be *extremely* careful here because of the \"Technical-term guard.\"  The rules are crystal clear: \"highly pathogenic\" is **Neutral** when part of a formal disease name, like HPAI, unless something else pops up to change things.  The regex confirms it; it even uses a negative lookahead to filter out \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\" specifically.\n\nSo, while \"highly pathogenic\" is present, it's modifying \"strain of avian influenza.\"  It's *not* working as an authorial intensifier, amping up a general risk adjective like \"deadly\" or \"dangerous.\"  It's a technical term, part of the formal name.\n\nTherefore, \"highly pathogenic\" doesn't trigger Q1.  I have to answer \"no\" to Q1 and move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or the phrase 'on high alert' framing the event alarmingly. 'Highly pathogenic' describes the virus factually.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Evaluation: No Alarmist Framing Detected**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with assessing this text segment based on the criteria for Q2 of the decision tree. My job is to see if the language employed is deliberately alarmist. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, I looked for those high-octane verbs, the ones that really ratchet up the tension, like \"devastated\" or \"erupted.\" But no, the verbs here are pretty neutral: \"came,\" \"ordering,\" \"kept,\" \"confirmed,\" \"found.\" They simply state actions.\n\nNext, I hunted for those killer metaphors, you know, the ones that really paint a vivid, disturbing picture. Nope, nothing.\n\nThen, the superlative-negative combos, like \"worst nightmare\" or \"most devastating disaster.\" Nada.\n\nAnd finally, the classic \"on high alert\" phrase – a dead giveaway for alarmist framing. Not here either.\n\nThe phrase \"highly pathogenic strain\" deserves a closer look. While it describes a severe fact, it does so in a technical, descriptive way. The Bedrock Principle clearly states to code the *presentation*, not just the facts. This is a scientific description, not an alarmist embellishment. We're talking about the nature of the virus, not an amplified depiction of its impact or spread.\n\nSo, according to the Q2 rules, I'm comfortable saying \"no\" – this text isn't employing alarmist language. It's time to move on to Q3."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified 'moderate verbs' paired with scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Framing: Q3 Evaluation**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\" My task is to see if this triggers an \"Alarmist\" frame according to Q3 of the decision tree.\n\nFirst, I need to scan for those \"moderate verbs\" that are known triggers. I'm checking for things like \"hit,\" \"swept,\" \"surged,\" etc. Scanning the text, I see \"came,\" \"ordering,\" \"kept,\" \"confirmed,\" and \"found.\" None of these verbs are on my list of moderate verbs associated with an alarmist frame.\n\nI also checked if any verbs related to culling or depopulation were present, but there was no such mention of that.\n\nSince the text doesn't contain a moderate verb from the defined list, the condition for Q3 isn't met. I'm confident in saying that the answer to Q3 is \"no.\" This means I'll move on to the next question in the decision tree. For this specific task, I just need to output the JSON, based on the \"no\" answer, as per the instructions."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text segment contains no questions, rhetorical or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and asked to check if it fits the criteria of Q4 in my decision tree. Basically, I need to see if there are any loaded rhetorical questions meant to scare people.\n\nI took a good look at the text: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\"\n\nRight away, I can tell this is a straight-up statement. It's giving me the facts: there was an outbreak, the government tried to prevent it, and here's the background. There are no question marks, no implications, no attempts to make me feel a particular way through questioning. It's just a matter-of-fact report.\n\nSince there are no questions, let alone *loaded* rhetorical ones, I'm confident in answering \"no\" to Q4. I'll format my response as requested."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative event (outbreak) and a negative fact (highly pathogenic strain) but contains no explicit language from the author or a source designed to calm concerns or assure current safety.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Against Q5**\n\nOkay, I've got it. The task is to analyze this text snippet and see if it contains any explicit calming language – those reassuring phrases we're looking for under Q5. I'm focusing on cues that suggest safety, control, or significantly minimized risk *in the present moment*.\n\nHere's the text: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\"\n\nRight away, I'm noting the context is negative – an outbreak despite preventative measures, and confirmation of a dangerous strain. Now, I'm specifically scanning for those key phrases: \"no cause for alarm,\" \"public can rest easy,\" anything emphasizing low risk or excellent control. I'm looking for direct assurances.\n\nAs I reread, I see nothing of the sort. There's no attempt to downplay the situation for the public. The mention of the government order to keep birds indoors is a past action, a preventative measure. It's not a statement about the *current* state of safety or that the situation is now under control. In fact, the word \"outbreak\" indicates the opposite.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding of Q5 and the explicit criteria, my answer is \"no.\" The text segment doesn't contain any of the calming cues that would indicate a positive response to this question."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'two dead wild swans' but lacks both a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) and a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'among millions') required for this rule.", "thoughts": "**Q6 Evaluation: Minimiser + Scale Contrast for Reassurance**\n\nOkay, here's my assessment of the text segment: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\" I need to determine if this pattern utilizes a 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' strategy for reassurance, as defined by Q6.\n\nFirst, I parsed the sentence. I identified the key phrase I need to focus on: \"two dead wild swans.\" My task now is to see if it includes a minimizer, such as \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few\" before the number \"two\". It doesn't. The text reads \"in *two* dead wild swans\", so it doesn't meet the minimizer criteria on its own. It's simply stating the number. The guideline is clear on this; a bare numeral isn't enough.\n\nNext, I need to check for a scale contrast. Is there any attempt to frame the two swans as a small fraction of a larger, less concerning whole? Does it compare them to a broader population or total number? No. There's no context suggesting this is a small number *out of* something larger, like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions.\" The text just mentions \"in two dead wild swans\".\n\nTherefore, since neither a qualifying minimiser nor a scale contrast are present in conjunction with \"two dead wild swans\", the 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' pattern isn't employed here. The answer to Q6 is \"no\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The text does not include a minimizer (e.g., 'only', 'just') preceding the numeral 'two', and it does not establish a scale contrast by comparing the number of dead swans to a larger population or context. Therefore, the 'Minimiser + Scale Contrast' pattern is not present.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any bare negation phrases like 'not expected', 'unlikely', 'no evidence', 'tests were negative', or similar.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question 7**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this text segment: \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\" My task is to evaluate this against Question 7 of the decision tree. Q7 is all about identifying \"bare negations\" – those instances where the text attempts to downplay or negate a risk without any explicit reassurance.\n\nMy expert eye immediately zeroes in on the key phrases. I'm looking for language like \"no risk,\" \"unlikely to spread,\" \"not a public health concern,\" etc. Words that are factually negating a risk or problem.\n\nLet's break it down: \"The outbreak came despite...\" clearly establishes a contrast, but it doesn't negate the problem of an outbreak. It sets up the situation.  \"ordering all birds...to be kept indoors\" describes a preventative measure; again, not a negation. The crucial part, \"tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain...\" actually *confirms* a negative, not denies it.  That's a negative finding. \"In two dead wild swans...\" that just provides context.\n\nI see no phrases that are explicitly negating a risk or downplaying a problem. The presence of a \"highly pathogenic strain\" is pretty significant, and this segment doesn't try to sugarcoat it with a minimizing phrase.\n\nTherefore, Q7, the question of \"bare negation,\" doesn't apply here.  I must answer \"no\" to this question and move on to the next one in the decision tree (Q8).\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The text segment does not contain any phrases that downplay or negate a risk/problem factually without explicit reassurance. The confirmation of a 'highly pathogenic strain' acknowledges a negative event and does not attempt to minimize the associated risk.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Describes a preparedness measure ('ordering all birds... to be kept indoors') factually without explicit language linking it to current calm or safety.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Does this Segment Fit Q8?**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to assess whether the text segment aligns with Q8 – that is, if it describes government capability or preparedness without actively reassuring the audience about the current situation.\n\nFirst, I need to pinpoint the key language related to preparedness. The segment highlights the government's action of \"ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors\". This is clearly a proactive measure, a safeguard implemented in response to the avian influenza threat.\n\nNow, the crucial test: does this action offer immediate reassurance? Does the text say something like, \"because of this, the public is safe,\" or \"don't worry, the risk is negligible\"? Absolutely not. Instead, it immediately states, \"The outbreak came *despite* the government... ordering.\" That \"despite\" is the critical word. It explicitly *negates* any implication of immediate success or safety arising from the measure. It's a statement of fact: a measure was taken, and the problem still occurred.\n\nTherefore, the segment describes a government action aimed at preparedness (\"ordering... to be kept indoors\") *without* linking it to present calm or safety. In my assessment, this directly aligns with the conditions of Q8. This is a clear instance of describing a capability without offering active reassurance.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll formulate my answer as:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment includes the phrase \\\"ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors,\\\" which describes a measure taken to address the situation. It then states the outbreak happened 'despite' this measure, so it does not offer any present safety reassurance.\"\n}\n```"}
