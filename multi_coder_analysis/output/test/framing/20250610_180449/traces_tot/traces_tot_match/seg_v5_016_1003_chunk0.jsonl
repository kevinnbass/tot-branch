{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes economic facts about poultry production and feed grain usage, containing no intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Evaluation: A Clean Pass**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment: \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\" My task is to run it against Q1 of the 12-step decision tree for claim framing. Specifically, I'm looking for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nI immediately scan for those key patterns: something like \"so deadly,\" \"very dangerous,\" \"more severe,\" or \"deadly from the start.\"  The text doesn't leap out at me.\n\nLet's break it down: \"Almost 18 percent\" - that's a quantity, a measure.  \"U.S. poultry production is exported\" - a straightforward economic fact about trade. And finally, \"industry is a major user\" -  \"major\" here qualifies \"user,\" which is a role or characteristic of the industry. \"User\" certainly isn't a risk-adjective.\n\nSo, in this segment, there are *no* intensifiers or comparatives modifying any risk-adjectives.  It's all about economic facts and industry characteristics.  Q1 is a \"no\".  I'll need to document this rationale and then move on to Q2. It's a clear-cut case. I will now provide the JSON structure for Q1 as requested."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment provides factual statistics about poultry production and feed grain usage, containing no high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 alarmist cues.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment for Framing Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I've been given a text segment and tasked with evaluating it against Q2 of the framing analysis decision tree. Q2 is all about identifying potentially alarming framing devices: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative noun combinations, and the \"on high alert\" phrase. I know the drill.\n\nLet's dive in. The segment in question is: \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"\n\nMy initial thought is that this looks pretty straightforward. I need to specifically look for those Q2 \"triggers.\"  I have the list of examples from the Q2 rules and examples to refresh my memory, but as an expert in this field, I know what to look for at a glance. I need to be on the lookout for verbs like \"ravaged,\" metaphors like \"ticking time-bomb,\" superlative-negative noun combos like \"worst disaster,\" and that \"on high alert\" phrase.\n\nI'm reading the segment again, focusing on those patterns.  Hmm... I see factual information about poultry exports and feed grain usage.  I'm not seeing any of those alarmist framing techniques. No high-potency verbs describing negative impacts, no dramatic metaphors, no \"worst-ever\" scenarios, and certainly no \"on high alert\" language.\n\nSo, based on my analysis, the answer to Q2 is definitely \"no.\" None of the framing cues identified by Q2 are present in this segment.  Now, I should move to Q3, but the prompt only asked for the Q2 answer. I will prepare my JSON output to accurately reflect this analysis and provide the necessary rationale."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Framing: Q3 Application**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with assessing this text snippet through the lens of Q3 in that decision tree – looking specifically for alarmist framing. My expert eye immediately goes to the verbs, since that's where the nuance often lies. Q3 says I should be on the lookout for certain \"moderate\" verbs *and* some kind of indicator of significant scale or impact.\n\nSo, let's dissect this. The text reads: \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\" Scanning for those red-flag verbs - the ones that suggest crisis or urgency like 'hit,' 'swept,' 'soared,' etc. - I see right away that's not what we have here. \"Is exported\" and \"is a major user\" are both very factual, descriptive verbs. Nothing in that wording screams \"alarm!\"\n\nFurthermore, the scale indicators aren't present. We *do* have percentages and the descriptor \"major,\" but that's a description and not \"record numbers,\" \"devastating losses,\" or anything on the provided list of alarm-related indicators.\n\nTherefore, the answer is a clear \"no\" to Q3. The text segment fails to meet both criteria: no moderate verbs, and no related indicators. I'll need to articulate that in my rationale, specifically pointing out the absence of the flagged verbs/impact markers as defined by the decision tree."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains factual statements and no questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Rhetoric**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to assess this text snippet against the criteria for Q4 in the decision tree. That's the one that flags loaded rhetorical questions designed to induce alarm, right? Let's see... the text is \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"\n\nRight off the bat, I can see this isn't a question at all. It's two factual statements about the poultry industry: export percentage and feed grain usage.  There's no phrasing here that's attempting to insinuate a problem or alarm the reader.  It's just straightforward information.\n\nSo, the answer to Q4 has to be \"no\". I'll put that in the JSON and briefly explain my reasoning.\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The text segment provides factual statements and does not contain any questions, let alone loaded rhetorical questions designed to imply alarm.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment provides factual statistics about poultry production and feed grain usage but contains no explicit calming language or assurances of safety/control.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\" My task is to determine if this aligns with Q5 of my decision tree, specifically looking for explicit calming cues.\n\nI immediately dissected the segment. The first part, \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported,\" is purely factual and statistical. It's a percentage, a neutral statement, something I'd expect to see in a market report. No bells or whistles. Similarly, the second part, \"the industry is a major user of feed grains,\" describes an industry operation, a straightforward fact about inputs.\n\nI went through my mental checklist: I was looking for phrases, language designed to reassure the public or stakeholders. I needed to see phrases like \"no need to worry,\" \"everything is under control,\" \"risk is minimal,\" or something along those lines. I saw *nothing* like that. No preparedness cues, no attempts to paint a positive, reassuring picture about safety or risk. It's just straight reporting.\n\nGiven the absence of any explicit calming language and its focus on factual details, my answer to Q5 is a definitive \"no.\" This segment does *not* contain any explicit calming cues or reassurance. It is a description of facts."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a percentage ('Almost 18 percent') and a fact about the industry, neither of which uses a minimiser word ('only', 'just', 'few') in conjunction with a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'among millions') to downplay significance.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis: Absence of Minimiser + Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with assessing a text snippet against the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern, a key element for reassurance analysis. The segment provided is: \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"\n\nMy first step is to break this down. The core requirements are the presence of a *minimiser word* (like \"only\", \"just\") combined with an *explicit scale contrast*. The aim is to check if these elements work together to downplay a potentially alarming statistic and therefore offer a reassuring effect.\n\nLooking closely, the segment does state \"Almost 18 percent,\" which provides a specific percentage, but this isn't a minimiser. It's simply a factual statement with a modifier \"almost\" modifying it. The rest of the segment, specifically \"of U.S. poultry production is exported,\" simply provides context. It doesn't use a phrase that explicitly creates scale contrast either.\n\nThe second part of the statement, \"and the industry is a major user of feed grains,\" is a completely separate claim, independent of the export percentage. There's no attempt to downplay or reframe the initial figure with minimisers and contrast in it.\n\nTherefore, considering the lack of the specified key elements, the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern isn't present in this segment. My answer to the evaluation of Q6 must be \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the required combination of a minimiser and an explicit scale contrast to offer reassurance isn't detectable in the provided text."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no bare negation or denial of risk/problem.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, let me break this down. The task is to apply the Q7 rule – specifically, to identify whether the text segment includes a \"bare negation\" without a \"calming cue.\" I'm looking for direct denials or downplaying of risks, like \"not expected,\" or \"no evidence,\" without any softening language.\n\nThe segment in question states two key facts: that \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"\n\nMy thought process is straightforward: I need to scan for those key negative terms. I see no \"not,\" \"no,\" \"unlikely,\" or any other phrasing that denies a potential problem or risk. It's just a factual description of percentages and industry usage. No mitigation, no negation. It's simply descriptive information.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the segment does *not* contain a \"bare negation.\" That means the answer to Q7 is \"no,\" and I should proceed to analyze it further based on the guidelines."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes industry characteristics (exports, feed usage), not capabilities or preparedness measures related to managing risk or a problem.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of Segment's Relevance to Q8**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet about poultry exports and feed grain usage, and my task is to assess it against question Q8 of a decision tree. Q8 is looking for descriptions of capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, *specifically* when these things are *not* explicitly linked to current calm, safety, or risk minimization.\n\nMy initial thought is to break down the snippet. \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported\" – that's just a descriptive statistic. It's quantifying the scale of the industry, not outlining a capability or plan for dealing with a potential threat. Similarly, \"the industry is a major user of feed grains\" – it's a statement of fact about resource consumption within the sector. It doesn't tell me anything about how the industry is prepared for or safeguarding against a specific risk.\n\nMy expertise tells me that this snippet is pure description, it's about the poultry industry's scale and its place in the agricultural economy. It's not operating in the realm of risk management or contingency planning, which is what Q8 is concerned with.\n\nI then consider the examples Q8's definition offers. They're all about things like vaccines, containment strategies, resource allocation, and recovery plans. All of these concepts relate to managing a specific situation or problem. The poultry data in this snippet simply does not fit that pattern.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the segment *does not* describe any capabilities or preparedness measures as Q8 defines them. The answer to Q8 is definitively \"no.\" The segment fails to meet the criteria. My rationale for that is clear: the snippet focuses on industry characteristics, not preparedness, which means there is no need to reference any cue because the snippet does not contain the characteristics of Q8.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate JSON output would be {\"answer\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"The segment describes industry characteristics, not capabilities or preparedness measures related to managing risk or a problem.\"}."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports numerical data ('Almost 18 percent') and industry characteristics ('major user') using standard, factual language without vivid verbs or risk adjectives.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Segment Against Q9**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The task is to evaluate this text snippet against Q9 of the decision tree. Q9, as I understand it, looks for factual reporting of prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using standard verbs and potentially neutral adverbs, *without* the usual alarmist or reassuring language.\n\nFirst, I see the numerical data immediately: \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported.\" and the indication of the industry's role as \"a major user of feed grains.\" So, check, we have relevant data.\n\nNext, the verbs. \"Is exported\" and \"is a major user\". These are straightforward, factual verbs, perfectly acceptable under Q9. No \"skyrocketing\" or \"plummeting\" here, which is what we *wouldn't* want.\n\nAdverbs? Well, \"Almost 18 percent\" is a quantifier, not an adverb used in the context of this decision tree's question.  \"Major user\" is an adjective, and a neutral one at that. It describes the characteristics, not a *change* in any metric. This aligns with what we're looking for, which are fact-based reports of economic metrics.\n\nFinally, explicit framing? No, nothing here. No \"catastrophic losses\" or \"rest easy\" statements, no nothing that would move this segment away from neutrality.\n\nGiven that it reports both a percentage figure and a role, using factual language, I'm going to say \"yes\" to Q9. The frame is neutral. That's the crux of it - the *factual* reporting and not the framing itself is key to making this determination. This text snippet sticks to the facts. The segment clearly reports the economic data with factual verbs and adjectives, without any sensational language or risk-oriented framing. This aligns with the neutral framing criteria in Q9."}
