{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains 'potentially deadly'. 'Potentially' is a modal adverb indicating possibility, not an intensifier or comparative modifying the risk-adjective 'deadly' to amplify its degree.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Segment Against Q1 of the Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, I'm diving in. The user wants me to apply the first question of this 12-step decision tree for claim framing to the provided text: \"The poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry.\" The rule for Q1 is pretty straightforward: look for an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nI've got the risk-adjective list in my head – \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" etc. – and the intensifiers – \"very,\" \"extremely\" – and comparatives – \"more,\" \"less,\" etc. Let's see if this pattern shows up.\n\nScanning the segment, I first see \"more quickly stop the spread.\" \"More\" is there, but it's modifying an adverb, \"quickly.\" Not what we're looking for.\n\nThen I get to \"potentially deadly.\" \"Deadly\" *is* a risk-adjective. But \"potentially\" isn't an intensifier or a comparative. It's a modal adverb, expressing possibility. It's like saying \"it *could* be deadly,\" not that it's *more* deadly or *very* deadly. The rule explicitly calls for intensification or comparison of the risk adjective itself. \"Potentially deadly\" doesn't fit that bill. It's describing a quality, a potential characteristic, not an amplified degree of deadliness.\n\nGiven the criteria – and after carefully reviewing the provided examples – I'm confident in saying the pattern isn't present. My answer to Q1 is \"no.\""}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative-noun patterns, or the 'on high alert' phrase as defined by Q2 rules.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: A Detailed Look at the Provided Text**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with this text snippet and tasked with evaluating it against Question 2 of our decision tree. My focus here is strictly on identifying alarmist language, specifically looking for high-potency verbs, impactful metaphors, superlative plus negative noun combinations, or the \"on high alert\" phrase, *in relation to the impact or description of the event*.\n\nFirst, I scanned for any high-octane verbs like \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" or \"skyrocketed\" – you know, those verbs that really punch up the severity of a situation. Didn't see any of those. Then, I looked for potent metaphors, those vivid, paint-a-picture phrases like \"ticking time-bomb\" or \"nightmare scenario.\" Nope, nothing like that either. The text uses adjectives and advice.\n\nNext, I went hunting for the \"superlative plus negative noun\" patterns. You know, phrases like \"worst crisis\" or \"most expensive disaster.\" No luck there either. Finally, I kept an eye out for the specific phrase \"on high alert,\" which is a clear signal. Didn't pop up.\n\nThe segment *does* use the phrase \"potentially deadly.\" Now, this *could* be a point of contention, but here's where the nuance comes in. While \"potentially deadly\" definitely highlights risk, it's an adjective describing the virus's nature, not a high-potency verb, a metaphor, a superlative, or \"on high alert\" *describing the event or its impacts*. Remember, we code the presentation, not the facts themselves. The Bedrock Principle states that a severe fact presented factually is Neutral. I believe that it fails Q1 too, since it does not include intensifiers.\n\nIt also contains the phrase \"urging caution.\" That’s related to risk, but it's not a high-potency verb, metaphor, superlative or the phrase \"on high alert.\" It's advice *based* on the potential risk, not the impact itself.\n\nSo, *strictly* adhering to the parameters set by Q2, I have to conclude that no alarmist language - as defined by the presence of high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative/negative patterns, or the \"on high alert\" phrase *describing the event or its impacts* - is present in this segment. My answer for Q2, therefore, is \"no,\" and I will proceed to the next question."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with details of significant scale or realised impact. It mentions a potential risk ('potentially deadly') but not a past or current impact with scale.", "thoughts": "**Evaluation of Text Segment Against Q3 Criteria**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The user wants me to assess a text snippet against the Q3 criteria of the decision tree. Q3 is all about identifying that Alarmist framing, so I'm looking for moderate verbs indicating a *realised* impact *combined* with details about the magnitude or scope of that impact.\n\nSo, I need to scan for those \"moderate verbs\" (like `hit`, `swept`, `surged`, etc.) paired with information that quantifies the harm or significance. Let's see...\n\nI'm analyzing: \"The poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry.\"\n\nHmm. I'm seeing phrases about plans, learning, urging caution, and potential danger. However, none of the verbs here (like \"say,\" \"stop,\" \"learned,\" \"urging,\" and \"is\") are on my approved list of moderate verbs that suggest a *realised* impact. Moreover, even the phrase \"potentially deadly\" focuses on *potential* harm, not a *realised* one, and there's no accompanying scale information. So I can't find the necessary verbs or realized impact with scale.\n\nTherefore, this text does **not** meet the criteria for Q3. My answer is **no**."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no questions, rhetorical or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Q4 Evaluation: No Loaded Rhetorical Questions Detected**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to assess the provided text segment against Q4, specifically looking for loaded rhetorical questions that are designed to incite alarm.\n\nFirst, I examined the segment: \"The poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry.\" It's a straightforward statement, really.\n\nThen, I focused on Q4 itself: Does this segment contain a loaded rhetorical question intended to create fear or a sense of urgency? I had to scrutinize the text for any questioning, either direct from the author or within a quoted source.\n\nThe immediate conclusion? No questions. Not a single one. It's all declarative, laying out information about the industry's response to a potential threat. Therefore, because there are no questions present in the first place, it's impossible for there to be any rhetorical ones.\n\nSo, the answer to Q4 is definitively \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the text segment does not contain any questions, let alone loaded rhetorical ones aimed at provoking anxiety."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions preparedness plans but does not include explicit calming language or link the plans directly to present public safety or minimized risk, as required by Q5 criteria.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text's Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this segment against Q5, which means I'm hunting for explicit calming language that reassures the public about their present safety, control, or significantly minimized risk. My expert eye immediately goes to those telltale phrases: \"no cause for alarm,\" \"public can rest easy,\" \"fully under control,\" those sorts of things. I'm also watching for intensified low-risk statements, positive amplification, confidence statements, and specific preparedness cues from officials tied directly to public safety.\n\nThe text reads, \"The poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry.\" Hmm. On the surface, I see that phrase about having \"plans to more quickly stop the spread.\" That *could* be a preparedness cue, but the Q5 criteria are pretty strict. We're looking for these conditions to be met.\n\nFirstly, the speaker has to be the government or a public health authority, or the text needs to mention public/consumer safety within 40 characters. We've got \"government officials,\" so that's a check. However, and this is the crucial part: there has to be a direct link between that preparedness capability and *present* safety, something like \"so the public can rest easy\" or \"meaning consumers are protected.\" That's the missing link here. The text only mentions plans to stop the spread more quickly – it doesn't explicitly translate that to *immediate* public safety. It just states they have plans to stop the spread more quickly.\n\nAnd, as if to underscore the point, the very next part of the sentence adds a note of caution: \"they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry.\" That's the exact opposite of a calming cue! It’s all about the potential threat. So, when I weigh all this, considering the strict criteria of Q5, and taking the cautionary tone, I have to conclude that this segment does *not* contain an explicit calming cue.\nTherefore, my final answer to Q5 is a definitive \"no.\""}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser word (e.g., 'only', 'just') combined with an explicit scale contrast (e.g., 'out of thousands') to downplay an event.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment for Reassurance Techniques**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with assessing the provided text snippet against Q6, the prompt that focuses on the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" reassurance technique. My initial step is always to thoroughly analyze the text. This particular segment reads, \"The poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry.\"\n\nFirst, I need to scan for any minimisers. These are the linguistic markers like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely\" that subtly reduce the perceived severity of an event. I don't see any of those here. Nothing like \"only a few cases\" or \"just a single outbreak.\"\n\nNext, I need to identify any instances of scale contrast. This involves looking for phrases that emphasize a large scope or context to downplay a specific occurrence. Examples would be \"out of millions\" or \"nationwide\" used to create that comparison. While the text mentions \"commercial poultry\" and \"nationwide,\" implying a large scale, the segment doesn't use those terms to minimize anything. It doesn't say something like \"only affected a small number *nationwide*.\"\n\nCrucially, Q6 requires both a minimiser *and* a scale contrast working in tandem to diminish the importance of an event. Since neither element is present in the specified combination, my conclusion is straightforward: the criteria for Q6 are not met. Therefore, the answer is \"no.\" This is the core of my rationale: the text lacks the necessary combination of a minimiser and a scale contrast to meet the Q6 requirements."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a bare negation cue as defined by Q7 (e.g., 'not expected', 'unlikely', 'no evidence', 'doesn't pose a risk').", "thoughts": "**Assessing for \"Bare Negations\" in the Text**\n\nOkay, I need to see if this text chunk hits on Q7's definition of a \"bare negation\" *without* a calming cue. First things first, I'll break down the segment: \"The poultry industry and government officials say they have plans to more quickly stop the spread that were learned from 2015, but they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly to commercial poultry.\"\n\nAlright, my initial read shows no blatant negations jumping out. \"Plans to stop the spread\" is all about action and doesn't negate anything about the current situation. The phrase \"potentially deadly\" actually *highlights* a risk, it's not a negation. I'm looking for the standard suspects here: \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" anything that directly refutes a negative consequence. We're clear on that. I'm specifically on the lookout for negations about expectation, evidence, risk, or capability that don't have a safety net of soothing language, so to speak.\n\nSince I don't see any of those types of negations, this segment doesn't meet the Q7 criteria. The answer is a clear \"no.\" The segment doesn't contain a bare negation as we define it. The absence of specific negations is key here."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Describes 'plans to more quickly stop the spread' (capability/preparedness) without explicitly linking this to current calm or safety.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I've got this text segment to analyze against Q8 of the decision tree. My initial read immediately flagged potential capability language: \"they have plans to more quickly stop the spread.\" That's the key phrase here. It's clearly describing preparedness or, at the very least, a capability.\n\nNow, the crucial step is to see if this is tied to any kind of direct reassurance – something that explicitly states we can relax, that risks are minimized, that everything's under control *now*. Nope. Not seeing it.\n\nIn fact, the very next part of the sentence undercuts any potential for reassurance. The \"but they’re urging caution since the virus strain is potentially deadly...\" bit? That's definitely not comforting. It's injecting a dose of reality and a call for vigilance.\n\nSo, according to the rules, this fits the pattern perfectly: a description of capability or preparedness *without* any attempt at active reassurance. The answer to Q8 is a solid \"yes.\" And given the Precedence Ladder, this leads to a Neutral frame. I'll need to make sure my JSON response reflects this clearly, quoting the capability language and highlighting the lack of explicit reassurance."}
