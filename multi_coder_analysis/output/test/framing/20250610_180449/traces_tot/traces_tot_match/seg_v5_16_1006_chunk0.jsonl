{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective, nor the specified idiom.", "thoughts": "**Initial Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I'm being asked to apply the first question of the 12-step decision tree to this sentence: \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\" My first step is to quickly scan the text to identify the telltale signs that Q1 is looking for. This means hunting for intensifiers, comparative adjectives, risk adjectives, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\"\n\nLet's see: *so, very, extremely*... Nope. *More, deadlier*... Nope. *Deadly, dangerous, severe, catastrophic, brutal, contagious, virulent, destructive*... Still nothing. And definitely not \"deadly from the start/outset.\"\n\nWhile the situation described (euthanizing a flock) is inherently concerning and likely involves some degree of risk, the *language itself* used here is quite neutral and factual. There's no heightened language that would trigger a \"yes\" response to Q1. The statement is just reporting a lack of information.\n\nTherefore, after this preliminary scan, my assessment is that Q1 will be a \"no.\" I'm ready to move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a lack of information ('did not say') and contains no high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this text snippet: \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock,\" and I'm being asked to determine if it meets the criteria of Q2 in that decision tree.  Specifically, I'm looking for those \"trigger\" phrases: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative/negative noun combinations, or the \"on high alert\" phrase, usually coupled with a threat keyword.\n\nI quickly scanned the segment. There's no dramatic language here.  I didn't find any of those powerhouse verbs like \"ravaged\" or \"devastated.\"  No potent metaphors jumped out at me, nothing like \"ticking time-bomb.\" There are no superlative/negative noun combinations to be found. And, of course, the specific \"on high alert\" phrase isn't present, let alone with any threat context.\n\nEssentially, the statement is purely factual.  It simply states a lack of information.  No vivid language or emotional framing is used here.  So, based on my analysis, the answer to Q2 has to be \"no.\" I'm confident in my evaluation.  I should now proceed to the next question in the decision tree (Q3), but the task at hand only requires me to answer Q2."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'euthanize' is not on the list of moderate verbs for Q3, and the text does not provide information detailing significant scale or impact.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Evaluation - A Quick Check**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text: \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\" The task is to see if it meets the criteria of Q3 in the decision tree. I know Q3 is looking for a *moderate* verb from a predefined list or regex, coupled with information about significant scale or impact.\n\nFirst, I identified the key verb: \"euthanize.\" Immediately, a red flag went up. I'm intimately familiar with the \"60-Second Cue Cheat-Sheet\" and the \"Boundary Requirements.\" The word \"euthanize\" is *explicitly excluded*. It's not in the Q3 regex either, which looks for verbs like \"hit,\" \"swept,\" \"surged,\" etc.\n\nThen I scanned for scale or impact. \"The flock\" is mentioned, but that's not enough. Without a specific number or some indication of significant size (like \"millions\" or \"record losses\"), it's just a general reference.\n\nSince \"euthanize\" isn't a Q3-defined verb *and* there's no clear scale/impact, Q3's condition isn't met. Plus, it's about a future plan, not a realized impact, another reason to rule it out. So, the answer is a definitive \"no.\""}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain a question, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Q4 Analysis: No Loaded Rhetorical Questions Detected**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this text segment: \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\" My task is to determine if this piece of text aligns with the criteria for Q4 in the decision tree. Q4 is all about identifying those sneaky loaded rhetorical questions designed to spark alarm.\n\nFirst things first, I need to check if we even *have* a question. And, well, this is a straightforward declarative sentence. It's stating a fact, plain and simple. No question marks, no implied questions, nothing.\n\nSince there's no question to begin with, there's absolutely no way it's a loaded rhetorical one. So, the answer to Q4 is unequivocally \"no.\" I'll move on to Q5 as the decision tree dictates, but for now, the JSON for Q4 is all I need."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a lack of information about a process and contains no explicit calming language or cues about safety or control.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Reassuring Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text snippet, \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock,\" specifically to see if it's got any of those explicit calming cues we're looking for under Q5. We're talking about things like \"no cause for alarm,\" \"risk is very low,\" and any language that clearly signals safety, control, or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial read tells me this is a simple statement of fact, a withholding of information. It's not about reassuring the public. It doesn't use any of those phrases that directly tell people things are under control, or that there's nothing to worry about.  It's just stating a lack of disclosure.\n\nTherefore, my assessment is **no**. This segment doesn't meet the criteria for Q5. I'll move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment 'Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock' contains no minimiser or scale contrast cue.", "thoughts": "**Q6 Evaluation: A Straightforward 'No'**\n\nOkay, so I need to check this segment against Q6, which is all about the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern for reassurance. Let's see... the text is \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\"\n\nFirst, I quickly scan for any minimisers like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely\" - nope. Then, I look for a scale contrast, something like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions\" - still nothing. This segment just flat-out states a lack of information.\n\nEssentially, Q6 requires both elements: a minimiser *and* a scale contrast. The segment has neither. Therefore, the answer is unequivocally \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the necessary pattern is absent. I'll format the response as JSON as requested."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The negation 'did not say' reports a lack of disclosure, which does not fit the definition or examples of 'bare negation' related to risks, problems, or capabilities provided in Q7.", "thoughts": "**Q7 Evaluation: \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\"**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The task is to determine if the segment \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock\" contains a 'bare negation' according to Q7 of the decision tree. I know the drill.\n\nMy first thought is to zero in on the phrase \"did not say.\" That's the negation, no doubt. Now, the crucial part is whether this negation aligns with the examples provided in Q7, which are essentially phrases that negate potential risks or undesirable outcomes. Let's recap those examples: \"not expected to cause problems,\" \"unlikely to affect X,\" \"no human cases detected,\" etc.\n\nAnalyzing \"did not say,\" my immediate impression is that it doesn't quite fit the mold. The Q7 examples are about negating a negative event or a harmful characteristic. They're about reassuring the audience that something undesirable *isn't* present or *won't* happen.\n\n\"Did not say,\" on the other hand, is about a *lack* of information. It's about what Tyson Foods chose *not* to communicate. It's a statement about an action (or inaction) by the subject, not a statement negating an inherent property or potential impact of the situation itself. It's about a disclosure failure, not a risk negation.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm confident that \"did not say\" doesn't function as a 'bare negation' in the specific sense defined by Q7. It's simply a report of non-disclosure, not a negation of risk or potential harm, as the examples in Q7 specify.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q7 is \"no.\" This is because the negation \"did not say\" is focused on a lack of disclosure, not the absence of a risk or problem as defined by the Q7 examples."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states what was *not* said about a capability, rather than describing a capability or preparedness measure itself.", "thoughts": "**Q8 Evaluation: A Negative Answer**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment: \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\" The user wants me to assess it against Question Q8, which is all about spotting descriptions of capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards *without* any active reassurance. My initial thought is that this feels off.\n\nThe segment states what *wasn't* said about a capability, the method of euthanasia. Q8 is looking for descriptions *of* capabilities or plans. It's like the Q8 pattern matching table and detailed rules. They highlight statements that *describe* these things, like officials working on containment or the potential for a vaccine. This is just a statement about missing information.\n\nI've got to consider that this segment isn't describing a capability or plan itself. It's essentially a comment on a lack of information. Q8 is about statements *describing* these things. So, I see this segment as a statement about what wasn't provided, not a statement of preparedness or capability.\n\nMy expertise is telling me that this doesn't fit the pattern. It's not a description of a plan. It's a statement about a lack of one. Q8's definition is clear: it's looking for the *description* of these concepts.\n\nTherefore, Q8 doesn't apply here. I'm going to respond with a clear \"no\" and move on. The prompt is only asking for an answer to Q8, so I'll stop there."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not report prices, economic data, or numerical metrics. It discusses a company's action.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, I've been asked to assess this segment, \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock,\" against the decision tree's criteria, specifically question Q9. My expertise tells me that Q9 is looking for something specific: text that *primarily* reports prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using neutral language. We're looking for reporting, not commentary or analysis. It's essentially looking for a neutral presentation of the numbers.\n\nThis segment, however, is not about reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics at all. It's about a company's actions - or rather, their lack of a stated action - regarding animal welfare. It's discussing a situation, not reporting figures. There's no economic reporting here.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration based on my extensive knowledge, my answer to Q9 must be \"no.\" It fails to meet the core requirement of reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics as outlined in the prompt. I would have to articulate that in my explanation to the user."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a past action ('did not say') related to a negative event; it does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Q10 Evaluation: A Neutral Verdict**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock,\" and running it through my mental checklist for Q10 of the decision tree. The question is: Does this segment speculate about future relief or improvement without a calming cue?\n\nMy immediate assessment is, \"No.\"  This segment is reporting on *past* actions, specifically what Tyson *didn't* say.  The mention of \"euthanize\" is undeniably negative, but the phrasing is retrospective.  There's no forward-looking speculation here about an easing of the situation, a timeline for recovery, or even a hint of hope. No mention of \"soon,\" \"hopefully,\" \"will,\" or similar words.\n\nSince the answer to Q10 is clearly \"no,\" I'm keeping my mind on the next step. As instructed, I'm heading to Q11. No need to prematurely label the frame; I'll wait for the next data point."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no direct quotes or attributed statements from a source that provide explicit framing language.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\" And the task is to run this against Question 11 of the decision tree. My initial thought is to analyze the segment itself. It's a simple factual statement. Nothing terribly complex, just a declaration of a lack of information.\n\nNext, I need to check for those key indicators for Q11: direct quotes. I'm looking for a source *directly quoted* with an alarmist or reassuring frame. I scan the sentence... nope, no direct quotes. Then I pivot to attributed statements, looking for phrasing that clearly frames the information as either alarmist or reassuring. Still nothing. No specific sources quoted or even attributed in a way that suggests a particular bias.\n\nGiven the criteria of Q11, specifically focusing on *directly quoted* framing language, this segment doesn't meet the requirement. Since there are no quotes or attributed statements, I'm forced to answer \"no\" to Q11. That means I need to move on to the next question in the decision tree (Q12, though I'm not prompted for it right now). My JSON response will need to reflect this \"no\" answer, along with a rationale explaining that the segment lacks direct quotes or framing language from a quoted source."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports a lack of information factually, using neutral language without explicit framing cues.", "thoughts": "**Applying the Q12 Rule to \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this segment: \"Tyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\" The task is to apply the Q12 rule, which essentially asks if this is a purely factual presentation with no remaining alarmist or reassuring cues.  Given my expertise in this area, it's pretty straightforward.\n\nFirst, I quickly scan for any obvious alarmist or reassuring language that would trigger the earlier Q rules (Q1 through Q11).  I see no intensifiers with risk adjectives (Q1), no vivid verbs depicting impact (Q2) - \"euthanize\" is a technical term, not a vivid depiction of harm. There's no moderate verb with a scale or metric (Q3), and definitely no explicit calming language (Q4).\n\nNow, the crucial point is the \"did not say.\"  This falls under Q5, which deals with bare negations.  My understanding of Q5 is that a bare negation defaults to Neutral.  The segment doesn't claim *how* the euthanization will happen; it simply states a lack of information.\n\nI then went through Q6-Q11, checking for other specific patterns, like those that deal with comparisons, predictions, etc., but found none.\n\nEssentially, all I'm left with is a statement about what information is missing. The term \"euthanize,\" while potentially emotionally charged in other contexts, is used here as a technical term describing a planned procedure. Given that and the bare negation, there are no remaining framing cues.\n\nTherefore, because there are no explicit alarmist or reassuring framing cues remaining, and Q5 defaults to Neutral, the presentation is factual.  Q12 is definitely a \"yes\" here."}
