{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Claim Framing Evaluation**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to analyze the provided text segment against the criteria outlined in Q1 of the claim framing decision tree. Essentially, I'm looking for direct modifiers (intensifiers or comparatives) of risk-related adjectives, like \"so deadly\" or \"more dangerous.\"\n\nI've carefully read the segment, focusing on the potential for these patterns: \"Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system\" is a straightforward statement and not what I'm looking for. Then, I see \"The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world.\" While \"strongest\" is a superlative, it modifies \"surveillance program,\" a positive capability, not a risk descriptor for the disease itself. That likely falls into the *reassuring cue* category, perhaps Q4 or later, but not Q1. Lastly, \"USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease...\"  is also neutral and describes ongoing actions.\n\nAfter a thorough scan, I can confidently say that I don't see any instances of intensifiers or comparatives directly modifying the core risk adjectives – \"deadly\", \"dangerous\", \"severe\", or even the \"deadly from the start/outset\" idiom. Therefore, my evaluation leads me to a definitive \"no\" for Q1."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase 'on high alert' as defined by Q2 rules.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Against Q2 Criteria**\n\nOkay, so I've been given a text segment and asked to analyze it based on Question 2 of this decision tree. My goal is to determine if the text contains any alarmist cues, specifically those related to high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-plus-negative noun pairings, or the phrase \"on high alert\".\n\nLet's break down the text piece by piece:\n\nFirst, \"Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system\" is a straightforward statement regarding food safety. No alarm bells there. Just a factual assertion.\n\nNext, \"The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world.\"  While it *does* contain the superlative \"strongest\", it's modifying a positive concept, \"surveillance program.\"  Q2's criteria targets superlatives paired with negative or potentially alarming nouns. This is a positive statement of capability and strength.\n\nThen, we have \"USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease.\" \"Actively look\" isn't a particularly powerful verb. It's descriptive of a process, not something alarming. No metaphors jump out at me either.\n\nFinally, \"on high alert\" isn't present in the text, which is an obvious miss.\n\nGiven all of this, I'm confident that the text segment doesn't contain any of the indicators we're looking for under Q2. No alarmist language present here. Therefore, I'll proceed to the next question in the decision tree.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The text was evaluated against the criteria for Q2, which includes high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, and the phrase \\\"on high alert.\\\" None of these elements were found. The use of \\\"strongest\\\" was not paired with a negative noun and 'actively look' is not a high potency verb.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with scale or impact information.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Framing: Q3 Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system,' APHIS said in a statement on Monday. 'The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations,' it [APHIS] added.\" The prompt wants me to check for an 'Alarmist' frame based on the presence of specific verb pairings in Q3 of the decision tree. My goal here is to determine if Q3 applies to this text segment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Q3 is looking for. It's focused on \"moderate verbs\" paired with information about \"significant scale or impact.\" I know my regex and examples for moderate verbs (think things like `hit`, `swept`, `surged`, etc.). I have to check if these kinds of verbs are present here.\n\nI've already highlighted and noted the verbs in the passage: \"will not enter,\" \"has,\" \"is working,\" \"look for,\" and \"added.\" None of them jump out as moderate verbs. These verbs don't suggest a significant threat or immediate crisis. The language is more informational, focused on containment and surveillance.\n\nSince none of the required verbs are present, I can confidently conclude that Q3's criteria are not met. I have to say \"no\" to the question. Now, I have to format this for the output. I'll need a JSON object with my answer and a brief rationale explaining that the text doesn't contain the specific 'moderate verbs' the decision tree is looking for. This means, I proceed to the next question, but I have been tasked only with answering Q3."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text contains statements, not questions. There are no loaded rhetorical questions present.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, I've been asked to assess this text snippet against Q4 of our decision tree. That means I'm looking specifically for any loaded rhetorical questions – those veiled alarms. I know my stuff, so I can dive right in.\n\nThe text in question is: \"Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system,' APHIS said in a statement on Monday. 'The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations,' it [APHIS] added.\"\n\nSo, I've scanned the text, and there are two statements from APHIS. Neither one is a question! And definitely not any form of rhetorical question. So that's straightforward.\n\nThe answer here is clear.\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The provided text segment does not contain any questions, let alone loaded rhetorical questions designed to imply alarm. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Q4.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statement 'strongest AI surveillance program' is a superlative boast about capability from an official source, but it lacks the explicit link to present public/consumer safety required for a Q5 Reassuring cue.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment: No Explicit Calming Cue**\n\nOkay, I've analyzed that text segment against Q5 of the decision tree, looking specifically for explicit calming cues that reassure the public about current safety. Here's my thinking:\n\nFirst, the key phrase, \"Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system,\" is a straightforward positive fact – it's a bare negation, just stating what *won't* happen. It's not framed in a way that provides explicit reassurance. We'll handle this as neutral.\n\nThen we have the statement about the \"strongest AI surveillance program\" and the ongoing work to monitor the disease. This is where it gets interesting. While it's a government agency (APHIS/USDA) making the statement, which is relevant to the preparedness cues, it doesn't meet the *second* condition. Preparedness cues require the agency to link their capability *directly* to *present* public/consumer safety. The rule is very specific on this – a statement like \"…so the public can rest easy\" or \"…meaning consumers are protected\" is necessary. The text just states the capability exists and work is being done. The rule specifically states that superlative boasts like this (\"strongest surveillance program\") are considered Neutral.\n\nSo, while the text reports a positive fact about a process and an official report of capability/ongoing action, it doesn't employ the explicit calming language Q5 is looking for. No phrases like \"no cause for alarm,\" \"completely safe,\" or similar direct reassurances are present. Therefore, my conclusion is that the answer to Q5 is \"no.\" This means we proceed to Q7, which will handle the bare negation as Neutral, given that Q5-Q6 fail."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text does not contain a 'minimiser' (e.g., 'only', 'just') combined with a 'scale contrast' (e.g., 'out of thousands').", "thoughts": "**Q6 Evaluation: Reassurance and Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with checking this segment against Q6 of the decision tree. That means I'm looking for a specific pattern: a minimizer – think \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" – combined with a scale contrast – like \"out of thousands,\" or \"among millions,\" you know, something that highlights a limited scope relative to a larger potential.\n\nI need to read this text carefully and pinpoint if this specific reassuring structure exists.\n\nLet's break down the text:\n\n*   \"Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system\" - That's a straight-up negation.  It’s a strong statement but it doesn't fit the Q6 criteria. It's more aligned with capability or reassurance.\n*   \"The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world\" - This is just stating the system's strength. Nothing to do with Q6 here.\n*   \"USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease...\" - Action. Not what I'm looking for.\n\nI've carefully scanned the entire text, and I've not found a single instance of a minimizer. Not a \"only,\" not a \"just,\" not a \"merely,\" nothing. Without that, there's no way to trigger Q6.\n\nTherefore, my answer is \"no\". The specific pattern required for Q6 - a minimizer paired with a scale contrast - is entirely absent from the text."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'will not enter the food system' is a bare negation without explicit calming cue.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Bare Negation Detected**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment through the lens of Q7 in the decision tree. Q7's asking if it's a \"bare negation,\" meaning a statement that *directly* denies something without a clear calming cue. The segment in question reads, \"Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.\"\n\nMy immediate thought is, \"Ah, here's the kicker: 'Birds from the flocks *will not* enter the food system.'\" That's the bare negation right there. It's a direct denial of something happening. And the key thing I'm looking for is an *explicit* calming cue *immediately following* that negation, according to Q7's guidelines. I remember the examples provided for reassuring language: statements like \"so consumers can rest easy,\" or the negation being interpreted as a reason for calm.\n\nThe second sentence is interesting. It talks about surveillance, proactive measures, and a \"strongest AI surveillance program.\" That's all good, sounds positive, and I understand the intent is to reassure. But, and this is crucial, it's not actually *saying* anything explicitly reassuring. It doesn't offer any \"no need to worry\" or \"risk is low\" type of statements. It's describing *actions* and *capabilities*, not providing a direct assurance of safety *in the way that Q7 requires.*\n\nSo, no, that second sentence doesn't qualify as a reassuring cue.  It doesn't meet the \"explicitly calming\" bar Q7 sets. I have to call it as I see it. The first sentence is a bare negation: *\"Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system.\"*  And because there's no *direct*, reassuring language immediately following it, the answer to Q7 is a clear \"yes.\""}
