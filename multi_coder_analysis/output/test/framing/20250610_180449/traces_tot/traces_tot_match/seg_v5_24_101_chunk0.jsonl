{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains 'sharply higher' describing a price trend, but 'higher' is not a risk-adjective as defined in Q1.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Alarmist Language: A Quick Check**\n\nOkay, so I've been given a text segment and need to assess it against the first question of the claim-framing decision tree. The goal here is straightforward: does the segment contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a \"risk-adjective\" as defined by the protocol?\n\nLet's break it down. The segment reads, \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\" I'm looking for the specific pattern: *[Intensifier/Comparative] + [Risk-Adjective]*. My mental checklist is activated: risk-adjectives include things like \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" \"catastrophic,\" etc., while intensifiers and comparatives are your usual suspects: \"very,\" \"more,\" \"sharply,\" \"higher,\" and so on.\n\nThe segment *does* have \"sharply higher,\" but that's where things get interesting. \"Sharply\" *is* an intensifier, and \"higher\" *is* a comparative. However, \"higher\" isn't modifying a risk-adjective. It's modifying \"trending,\" which is describing the *direction* of the price movement. It's a vivid description of a background condition, not the threat's *actual impact*. This is important because the protocol specifically directs us to ignore this type of vivid language. Remember the \"Context guard for vivid language\"? It's there for a reason! We need to focus on what actually constitutes alarmist language.\n\nSo, in this case, even though we have an intensifier and a comparative, they're not operating on the *right* kind of word. My answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" The segment doesn't fit the specified pattern.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment contains the phrase 'trending sharply higher', where 'sharply' is an intensifier and 'higher' is a comparative. However, 'higher' modifies 'trending' (a background condition), not a risk-adjective.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase \"trending sharply higher\" uses a moderate verb ('trending') and an intensifier ('sharply higher') but not a high-potency verb or potent metaphor as defined by Q2.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of the Text Segment Against Q2 Criteria**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this text segment: \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\" and asked to assess it against the decision tree's Q2. This question specifically targets alarming framing through high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative noun combinations, or critical alert phrases.\n\nI'm looking closely for the trigger words and phrases outlined in the Q2 rules. I need to see if the language is actively *framing* the situation as alarming. The focus here is on identifying highly impactful language.\n\nMy immediate focus is the phrase \"'trending sharply higher.'\" Let's break it down: \"trending\" – that's a *moderate* verb indicating a direction, a tendency. It's not in the list of high-potency verbs I'm looking for (things like \"skyrocketed,\" \"devastated,\" \"crippling\"). Then there's \"sharply higher,\" which is an *intensifier*, but it's modifying the *trend* itself, not an impact noun like \"prices.\"\n\nI'm checking if \"'trending sharply higher'\" fits any of the Q2 patterns: Is \"trending\" a high-potency verb? No. Is \"sharply higher\" a potent metaphor? No. Is it a superlative + negative noun combination? No. Is it a critical alert phrase? Again, no.\n\nThe decision tree specifies \"soared/soaring\" are high-potency *only* when followed by an *impact noun*. That's not the case here. And even if it were, \"trending\" isn't \"soaring.\"\n\nIt's clear the phrase doesn't quite fit the criteria for Q2. \"Sharply\" is an intensifier, but it's not the risk adjective that would be flagged in Q1. The Q2 rules are clear: the language needs to *actively alarm*. \"Trending sharply higher\" describes a price movement, but the verb and structure are not overly dramatic.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the segment *does not* meet the criteria for Q2. I'll be answering \"no\" to this question and providing the rationale that the language doesn't contain a high-potency verb or potent metaphor as defined by the Q2 rules."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'trending' is not on the list of specified moderate verbs for Q3, although 'sharply higher' indicates scale/impact.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Analysis: Evaluating \"Trending Sharply Higher\"**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The task is to see if this text segment triggers Q3 in our decision tree, which is all about finding specific 'moderate verbs' paired with information about scale or impact. The segment is: \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\"\n\nFirst, I identified the verb phrase: \"'trending sharply higher'\". Now, does \"trending\" fit the bill? I have the list/regex: `hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|(?:were|was)\\s+culled`.  \"Trending,\" even with the adverb \"sharply\" and the adjective \"higher\", just doesn't make the cut. So the verb *itself* doesn't match the Q3 criteria.\n\nHowever, I do see scale and impact here. \"Sharply higher\" *does* tell us the prices are significantly increasing, impacting the average price of eggs. So that part checks out.\n\nBut Q3 needs *both* the right verb *and* scale/impact. The \"vivid language context guard\" doesn't help me here because \"trending sharply higher\" is directly describing the *subject* (the egg prices), not some background condition. That guard mostly applies to Q2 and Q1.\n\nTherefore, the core problem is the verb \"trending.\"  Even though we have a clear indication of scale, that verb simply isn't on the Q3 list of 'moderate verbs' like \"soared\" or \"plummeted.\" The phrase is \"trending sharply higher\". I have \"trending\" as the verb and it's not present in the Q3 list.\n\nThus, Q3 doesn't apply. I'll need to articulate this in the rationale:  Even though there's information about the *scale* of the price increase, the verb \"trending\" is not one of the specific moderate verbs required by Q3.  The answer is \"no\" for Q3."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a fact and does not contain any question, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against the Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to apply my expertise to this text snippet and see if it triggers Q4 of the decision tree. Q4's all about catching those loaded rhetorical questions that are designed to whip up a sense of alarm.\n\nThe text is: \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\"\n\nAlright, I see it. It's just a statement of fact, citing a report as its source. There's no question here, period. And certainly no question that's trying to slyly imply something alarming without actually asking. The phrase \"trending sharply higher\" could, by itself, suggest alarm, but it's presented as an objective observation supported by data.\n\nSo, Q4 is a clear \"no\" on this one. I'll structure the response as a JSON object, as requested, to keep things clean and organized."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text reports a price trend ('trending sharply higher') but contains no explicit language from the author or source designed to calm concerns, assure safety, or minimize risk.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text snippet and the Q5 criteria. The goal is to see if there are any explicit calming cues that would trigger the \"Reassuring\" frame. I need to be on the lookout for phrases like \"no cause for alarm,\" \"rest easy,\" or anything that explicitly minimizes present risk or communicates that the situation is under control.\n\nThis segment focuses on the price of eggs: \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\" Immediately, I see a price increase, which isn't inherently comforting. The text references the USDA, which lends some authority, but it doesn't *say* anything that directly calms concerns. There are no soothing words or reassurances about safety or control. \"Trending sharply higher\" is a statement about price movement, not a statement about risk or the lack thereof.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering the text against Q5, my answer is a definitive \"no.\" This segment doesn't contain any explicit calming language that would qualify as a \"Reassuring\" frame trigger. The focus is on a price increase, described in neutral terms, not on mitigating concerns or conveying safety."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no minimiser word ('only', 'just', 'merely', 'a single', 'few') or scale contrast ('out of X', 'among Y') used for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Minimisers and Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment and need to assess it against Decision Tree Q6. Essentially, I'm looking for evidence of \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" used for reassurance.  My expertise immediately tells me I'm looking for a specific linguistic pattern.\n\nLet's break it down:  First, I need a minimiser word – something like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely\" – to create a sense of scale.  Then, I need a clear comparison to a larger scale or context. This is the critical piece that provides reassurance. Think something like, \"only a few compared to the total number\".\n\nNow, onto the provided segment: \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\"\n\nImmediately, I start scanning for those minimiser words. Nothing. Not a single \"only,\" \"just,\" or any synonym. Then, I look for that crucial contrast. Is there any mention of a specific quantity or a larger context to minimize?  Nope. The phrase \"'trending sharply higher'\" describes an increase, but doesn't downplay that trend by minimizing it or contrasting it.\n\nTherefore, the segment clearly *doesn't* exhibit the pattern I was searching for. My answer to Q6 is definitively \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the necessary \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" for reassurance is absent from the text.  It's a straightforward evaluation."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes an increase ('trending sharply higher') and does not contain any form of bare negation.", "thoughts": "**Q7 Analysis: Identifying Bare Negations**\n\nAlright, I'm diving into this segment, as instructed, with a sharp focus on Q7 of our decision tree. My task is clear: does this text contain a 'bare negation' without any calming cues? I'm looking for telltale phrases like \"not a problem,\" \"no risk,\" or anything that immediately negates a potential issue without context.\n\nThe segment in question states, \"...the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\" My initial read suggests this is about price increases, not about negating a problem. It's describing an economic trend, specifically an upward one. This is key.\n\nThere's no mention of risks, dangers, or problems being dismissed. It simply reports the increase in egg prices. Therefore, based on my understanding of Q7, this segment does not contain a bare negation. My answer is a definitive \"no\"."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a market trend ('trending sharply higher') and does not mention capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Q8 Analysis: Assessing a Text Segment's Relevance**\n\nOkay, I'm being asked to evaluate this text snippet against Question 8 of the decision tree. Q8 is looking for specific types of information: descriptions of capabilities, preparedness, potential future positives, or implemented safeguards. The *key* here is that these elements must *not* be explicitly linked to a state of calm, safety, or reduced risk *in the present*.\n\nThe text in question states, \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\" My first step is to identify if the segment contains any language fitting the Q8 criteria.\n\nReading it, I see a clear statement about a market condition: egg prices are rising significantly. There's no mention of capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards. It’s simply a report of a negative trend.\n\nThe question explicitly asks about the absence of a link to a *current* state of calm, but in this case, the segment doesn't even discuss the types of things Q8 is looking for. It doesn't describe *anything* that Q8 is concerned with, therefore it's a straightforward \"no\" from me. The question's premise is not even met.\n\nTo be extra sure, I've re-consulted the Q8 examples. The table lists things like \"vaccine can be made,\" \"officials are working to contain,\" or \"restrictions may be short-lived.\"  My segment is a completely different type of statement. It's a fact about price, which is unrelated to the Q8 criteria. It’s clearly not a capability, nor future oriented positivity, nor a safeguard. The language is vivid, which might have implications further along the decision tree, perhaps in Alarmist, but Q8 is specifically about a different type of information.\n\nTherefore, my answer is a definitive \"no.\" This segment doesn't fit the pattern."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'trending sharply higher' reports price change using a standard verb ('trending') and a neutral adverb ('sharply'), fitting the Q9 criteria for Neutral.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment Against Q9**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to assess this segment against Q9 of the decision tree. The goal here is to see if the reporting of prices and metrics uses standard language. Specifically, does it use neutral verbs and adverbs, avoiding vivid verbs, risk adjectives, or explicit framing? Let's break it down.\n\nThe segment states: \"Recently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\" Alright, so it's clearly reporting a price change – the price of eggs.\n\nNow, the language used... The verb is \"trending,\" and the adverb is \"sharply.\" The combined phrase is \"'trending sharply higher.'\"\n\nLet's consult my cheat sheet, the \"Economic & Price Language Quick-Reference.\" Checking the rules, Q9 considers verbs like \"rose,\" \"declined,\" \"increased,\" \"fell\" as neutral. Adverbs like \"sharply higher,\" and \"significantly declined\" are also considered neutral, as long as they are not paired with a vivid verb or risk adjective. On the other hand, the table also clarifies that vivid verbs like \"skyrocketed\" and \"plummeted\" are alarmist, as are statements like \"catastrophic losses\".\n\nCrucially, the example \"Prices **trended sharply higher**\" is explicitly listed as **Neutral**! And the \"Key Principle\" confirms that adverbs like \"sharply\" don't increase the potency unless they're combined with a vivid verb or a risk adjective. \"Trending\" isn't listed as a vivid verb. It's standard economic parlance, descriptive and not overly dramatic.\n\nSo, according to Q9, this checks out as a \"yes.\" It reports prices using a standard verb (\"trending\") and a neutral adverb (\"sharply\"), without any alarmist language. The frame here is, therefore, Neutral, as dictated by the structure of the decision tree itself."}
