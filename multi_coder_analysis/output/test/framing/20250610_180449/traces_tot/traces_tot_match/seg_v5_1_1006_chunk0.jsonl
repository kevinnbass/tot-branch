{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'highly pathogenic' is part of the technical term 'highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)' and is excluded by the rules for Q1.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Claim Framing: Q1 Assessment**\n\nAlright, I'm diving into this segment, and my task is clear: check if it fits the pattern of an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective, as defined by Q1 of the decision tree. The segment is \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\"\n\nMy initial scan zeroes in on \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).\" This is where I have to be particularly precise. The rules explicitly highlight a \"Technical-term guard.\" This particular phrase, \"highly pathogenic,\" is embedded within a formal disease name, HPAI. According to the guidelines, this specific usage is considered neutral, *unless* there are other alarmist indicators present.\n\nCrucially, in this case, \"highly pathogenic\" isn't functioning as an authorial intensification of a general risk adjective. It's an integral part of the technical term, HPAI. Therefore, while \"highly\" *is* an intensifier, it isn't *directly* modifying a risk adjective in the way Q1 is looking for. This is a technical nuance, but a necessary one to preserve the integrity of the analysis.\n\nThus, my answer to Q1 is a firm \"no.\" The rationale is straightforward: \"highly pathogenic\" is part of the established technical term, HPAI, and is specifically excluded by the rules outlined for Q1. This context-dependent interpretation, based on the specific term's usage, is key to an accurate evaluation."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'infected' is a factual, moderate term and does not meet the criteria for a high-potency verb or other Q2 patterns.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Against Q2 Criteria**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The user wants me to run this text: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky\" through the Q2 filter of the decision tree. Q2 is looking for specific alarm-framing patterns, and I need to see if this sentence hits any of them.\n\nFirst, I'm checking for those high-potency verbs we've defined, the ones that really amp up the drama. I scan the sentence... \"infected.\" That's the key verb. Now, is \"infected\" on the list of verbs like \"ravaged,\" \"devastated,\" and the rest? Nope. Not there. It's a factual, clinical term, really, describing a biological process.\n\nNext, I look for those \"most/record/worst\" + \"disaster/crisis/outbreak/catastrophe\" combos.  Nothing.  No potent metaphors either, like a \"ticking time-bomb\" or \"raging inferno.\" And no \"on high alert\" phrase with a threat word following.\n\nSo, in my professional opinion, the answer to Q2 is a clear \"no.\" The verb \"infected,\" while relevant to the situation, doesn't meet the criteria for a high-potency verb, nor are any of the other alarm-framing patterns present. I'm ready to move on to Q3."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'has infected' is a plain factual verb, not a moderate verb from the specified list, and the scale 'a flock at one of its contract farms' is not presented as significant scale/impact.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of Question Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet about a poultry outbreak: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\" My task is to determine if this triggers an \"Alarmist\" frame according to the rules of Question Q3 in the 12-step decision tree.\n\nFirst, I need to pinpoint the key verb describing the event. Here, it's clearly \"has infected.\" Now comes the critical part: checking if this verb is considered a \"moderate verb\" according to the Q3 criteria. I recall the specific regex and list of verbs: `hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|(?:were|was)\\s+culled`. \"Infected\" isn't in that list. In fact, it's explicitly excluded as a \"plain factual verb\" like \"killed,\" \"died,\" or \"reported.\" So, on the verb front, we're not meeting the \"moderate verb\" requirement.\n\nNext, I look for information about the *scale* or *impact* of this infection. The text mentions \"a flock at one of its contract farms.\" That's quite specific, and it feels pretty localized. We're not talking about \"millions,\" \"record losses,\" or \"thousands affected.\" This isn't the kind of significant scale or impact Q3 is looking for.\n\nTo satisfy Q3, we need *both* a moderate verb *and* significant scale/impact. I don't see either. The verb is simply factual, and the scale is limited. Therefore, my conclusion is that this segment *does not* meet the conditions of Q3. My answer for Q3 is a clear \"no.\" My next step would be to move on to question Q4, but I'm only concerned with the JSON response for Q3 for now."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement reporting a fact and contains no questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Provided Text and Question Q4**\n\nOkay, so I need to assess this text segment against Question Q4. My immediate thought is to dissect the problem methodically. First, I have to *thoroughly* analyze the provided text: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\" Seems straightforward enough; just a factual statement of an event.\n\nNext, I need to understand Q4 perfectly. It's about *loaded rhetorical questions*, the kind designed to whip up alarm or urgency. I recall the examples given: questions like \"Should consumers worry?\" – designed to inject fear. The opposite would be something neutral, like \"What are the safety protocols?\"\n\nNow for the crucial step: comparing the text segment with what Q4 is looking for. After a careful reread, it's clear: there's *no question* at all! It's a straight-up declarative sentence. It *reports* a fact, albeit a potentially concerning one given my knowledge, but it's not trying to *instill* fear through clever questioning.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is obvious: the answer to Q4 has to be \"no\". There isn't even a rhetorical question to evaluate. It's simply irrelevant in this case. My final JSON response is going to reflect this."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text reports a negative fact (HPAI infection) neutrally and does not contain any explicit calming language or cues for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Question Q5**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\" My task is to evaluate this against Question Q5 of the decision tree, which concerns explicit calming cues, as defined by the \"Reassuring\" frame.\n\nI've got the Reassuring criteria at my fingertips, which, for Q5, is looking for explicit language designed to reassure the audience. I quickly run through my mental checklist: I'm not seeing phrases like \"no cause for alarm,\" \"public can rest easy,\" or anything else that directly attempts to calm concerns. There's no talk of the situation being \"fully under control\" or the risk being \"very low.\" No preparedness cues linked to public safety are present.\n\nInstead, what I see is a straightforward statement of fact: confirmation of an HPAI infection. It's a negative fact, yes, but it's presented neutrally. Applying the Bedrock Principle and the Symmetry Rule, a neutrally stated negative fact *isn't* reassuring; it's just neutral.\n\nTherefore, the text doesn't meet the criteria for Q5. There's no explicit calming language here. The answer to Q5 is definitely \"no.\" I'll need to explain this in the rationale, emphasizing the neutral presentation of a negative fact and the absence of any reassuring language. Now, it's time to move on to Q6."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'one of its contract farms' but lacks both a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) and an explicit scale contrast ('out of thousands').", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm evaluating this text snippet: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\" I need to determine if it uses \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" language for reassurance, as defined in Q6 of this decision tree.\n\nFirst, I looked for minimisers like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"a few.\" I found nothing of the sort. The phrase \"a flock at one of its contract farms\" doesn't use a minimiser. \"One\" here is a simple article, not preceded by a minimizer.\n\nNext, I checked for an explicit scale contrast, something like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions.\" While the segment mentions \"one of its contract farms,\" implying there are others, it doesn't quantify that or set it up as a contrasting scale to downplay the incident. It is just a factual description.\n\nGiven these findings, I conclude that the segment doesn't use \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast.\" The answer to Q6 is therefore \"no.\" My rationale would be: This segment lacks both a minimiser word and an explicit contrast to a larger scale as defined by the rule."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states that HPAI has infected a flock; it does not contain any form of bare negation or statement about the absence of a negative event.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Segment Against Decision Tree Q7**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with evaluating this text snippet against Q7 of the decision tree, which is all about spotting \"bare negations\" – statements that dismiss a risk or problem without any explicit reassurance. I need to be a bit of a linguistic detective here.\n\nI carefully read the provided segment: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\"\n\nMy initial scan focuses on identifying any negative phrasing or downplaying of the situation.  I'm looking for telltale signs like \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no risk,\" \"will not impact,\" etc. Essentially, any statement that directly or indirectly negates a potential negative outcome.\n\nHowever, after a thorough review, the segment doesn't contain anything like that.  It straightforwardly confirms an infection. There's no attempt to minimize, downplay, or reassure. It simply states a fact: HPAI is present.\n\nTherefore, Q7's condition isn't met. There's no bare negation to assess.  Since the answer is \"no,\" I need to move on to the next question in the decision tree (Q8). My JSON output will reflect this result."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not describe capabilities, preparedness measures, hopeful future possibilities, or implemented safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment: \"Tyson Foods... Kentucky\"**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My task is to evaluate this text segment (\"Tyson Foods...Kentucky\") against Question 8 of the decision tree. Q8 is looking for descriptions of capabilities, preparedness, or hopeful possibilities *without* those elements being explicitly linked to current calm or safety.\n\nFirst, I need to identify if the segment describes any of those things. I've gone through the checklist: capabilities? Nope. Preparedness measures? Not mentioned. Hopeful future possibilities? No. Safeguards in place? Nothing. Officials containing? No. Vaccine talk? Negative. Systems talk? Nada. The segment simply reports a factual event: an infection at a farm.\n\nSince there's no mention of capabilities or preparedness, the *condition* of Q8 isn't met. It asks if the segment describes those elements *without* reassurance, but since those elements aren't present, the question doesn't apply. It's like asking if a car is red *without* a sunroof, when there's no car.\n\nThe phrasing of Q8 is a bit tricky, but the key is that we're looking for descriptions that *would* be reassuring if explicitly linked to current calm. This segment doesn't even get to that point. It's a simple, factual statement of a negative event.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q8 is definitively \"no\". The segment doesn't describe capabilities or preparedness in the first place, so the question of whether it does so without reassurance is moot. This means I'll advance to Q9.\n\nThe bedrock principle and symmetry rule apply here. The segment states a negative event factually which aligns with the classification of neutral."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a factual event (HPAI infection) and does not contain economic data, prices, or metrics.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Decision Tree Q9**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\" My task is to evaluate this against Decision Tree Q9, which hinges on whether the segment primarily reports prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using specific, neutral language.\n\nAfter careful consideration, it's clear this segment doesn't fit the bill. I'm seeing a report of a factual event: the presence of HPAI in a chicken flock. It's news, yes, and important news at that, but it doesn't involve prices, economic indicators like GDP or inflation, or specific numerical data points like sales figures or market share. The focus here is a *biological* event within an agricultural context.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q9 has to be a firm \"no.\" The segment's primary concern isn't reporting economic data or metrics as defined by the decision tree's criteria. It's a news report, not a data report."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a current event (infection) and does not contain language speculating about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and need to evaluate it against Question Q10 of this decision tree. Q10's the one that's looking for speculation about future relief or improvement *without* an explicit calming cue about the present situation. In essence, it's asking if the text hints at things getting better down the line.\n\nThe text I'm looking at is: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\"\n\nAlright, let's break it down. I need to scan for any phrases that might suggest future relief or improvement. Stuff like \"may be short-lived,\" \"could ease soon,\" \"situation might improve,\" anything indicating a turnaround.\n\nI re-read the segment, focusing on that specific criteria. What I see is a straightforward report of a current event: \"infection.\" It's stating a fact, a negative fact, but a fact nonetheless. There's *nothing* in there about the future. No hints, no predictions, no projections of relief or improvement. It's just a statement of the present situation, with no indication of what might happen next.\n\nTherefore, the text does *not* satisfy the conditions of Q10. It doesn't speculate about future relief. My answer to Q10 is a resounding \"no.\" We can move onto the next question (Q11) as the prompt has requested."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "No direct quotes or attributed statements with explicit framing language found in the segment. The confirmation is a factual statement.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Q11 of the Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\" My task is to determine if this segment satisfies Q11, which looks for a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame expressed by a directly quoted source.\n\nFirst, I see that the segment *does* attribute a statement to Tyson Foods: \"Tyson Foods... confirmed that...\" This is promising, but the crucial test is whether the attributed statement contains framing language. The statement itself is a simple reporting of a fact: \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock.\"\n\nI'm checking for words or phrases that clearly signal an Alarmist or Reassuring frame. I'm thinking of examples I've seen before: \"concerning,\" \"alarming,\" \"safe,\" \"under control.\" But this statement uses neutral language. It simply confirms the presence of the virus. There's no subjective judgment, no emotional spin, no attempt to either downplay or exaggerate the situation coming directly from Tyson Foods. It's a factual confirmation.\n\nBecause the attributed statement lacks explicit framing, and because there are no direct quotes at all, Q11 is *not* met. My analysis points to a \"no\" answer. The rationale is straightforward: the segment contains no direct quotes and the attributed statement, while from a source, is factual and lacks any explicit framing language.\n\nThe JSON output, then, will be:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"No direct quotes or attributed statements with explicit framing language found in the segment.\"\n}\n```\nThis aligns perfectly with what's required."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues found. The segment reports a negative fact (infection) using factual, neutral language ('confirmed that... has infected').", "thoughts": "**My Thought Process: Analyzing the Text for Framing**\n\nOkay, here's how I see this. I was given this text segment: \"Tyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\" My goal is to determine the framing, but I'm constrained to only what's explicitly stated in the words themselves. I can't read between the lines or infer anything beyond what the language explicitly conveys, the \"Bedrock Principle\" and \"Symmetry Rule\".\n\nI've already run the gauntlet of questions, Q1 through Q11. That means I've checked for intensifiers, vivid verbs, exaggerated metrics, explicit calming language, and other indicators of alarmist or reassuring framing according to the defined criteria, and found nothing. I'm now at Q12, the \"default to neutral\" check.\n\nLet's quickly re-evaluate: \"highly pathogenic\" is technical jargon. It's the standard term for this virus, not an intensifier. \"Infected\" is a factual descriptor, not a dramatic verb. There's no attempt to downplay or amplify the severity. This is just a concise statement of fact.\n\nThe segment states a negative fact – an HPAI infection – but it does so without embellishment. It doesn't use emotionally charged language. The language used is objective and technical. Based on the rules and examples I'm familiar with, specifically in the Q12 table regarding \"Severe Fact, Neutral Presentation\", it seems to be exactly what that category describes. Therefore, the frame is Neutral. The text reports a negative fact in a neutral tone, devoid of framing cues."}
