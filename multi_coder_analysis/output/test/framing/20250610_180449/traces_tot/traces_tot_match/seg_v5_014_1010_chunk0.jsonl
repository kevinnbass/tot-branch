{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains economic terms ('burden', 'onerous') but no intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective from the specified list (deadly, dangerous, severe, etc.).", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: No Intensifiers Here**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"  My task, as I understand it, is to apply Q1 of the 12-step decision tree.  That means I'm looking for a specific pattern: an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective from our established list.\n\nLet's break it down. \"Eventual scale of the outbreak\" and \"subsequent euthanizations\" are factual descriptions, not evaluations of risk.  \"Impose a burden on consumers' wallets\" and \"already-onerous costs of poultry\" are dealing with *economic* impacts.  \"Burden\" and \"onerous\" are negative, yes, but they aren't the kind of risk-adjectives Q1 is focused on (things like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe\"). We're concerned here with describing the disease itself – its inherent threat.\n\nEssentially, I need to see something like \"very dangerous outbreak\" or \"more severe consequences.\"  I don't. The negative terms present are economic in nature, not inherent to the risk itself. Furthermore, \"already-onerous\" describes a *pre-existing* condition, not an intensification of the *current* threat.\n\nTherefore, because the specified pattern isn't present, the answer to Q1 is \"no.\" This segment doesn't contain the specific claim-framing cue we're looking for at this stage."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses phrases like 'impose a burden' and 'already-onerous costs', but these do not meet the criteria for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other specific patterns listed in Q2.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against Q2 of the Claim Framing Decision Tree**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I've been asked to assess this text segment against the criteria of Q2 in a claim framing decision tree. Essentially, I'm looking for evidence of \"alarmist\" framing, specifically through high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative/negative noun combinations, or the specific phrase \"on high alert\".\n\nMy initial scan focuses on identifying any high-impact verbs, vivid metaphors, or the specified phrase. The segment presents \"impose a burden\" and \"adding to\", which don't jump out as the kind of high-potency verbs we're looking for – verbs like \"ravaged\" or \"devastated\" that immediately evoke a strong sense of devastation.  The phrase \"impose a burden\" is descriptive of an impact, not quite the same. \"Adding to\" also seems neutral in this context.  No potent metaphors or superlative/negative noun pairings are evident.\n\nThe segment uses \"already-onerous costs.\" \"Onerous\" is indeed a negative adjective, suggesting undesirable costs, but Q2 is primarily focused on verbs and metaphors, and intensifying adjectives.  Since we skipped Q1 (which likely handles intensified adjectives and risk adjectives), I assume it didn't apply. While the costs are undesirable, \"onerous\" isn't intensified.\n\nI've carefully re-read the Q2 rule and its examples. The table clearly lists specific high-potency verbs (ravaged, devastated, etc.).  My segment doesn't contain any of those.  The verbs \"impose\" and \"adding\" are more moderate than the list in the rule.  The \"impose a burden\" phrase describes a potential negative outcome, and \"onerous\" is an adjective, but neither meets the Q2 criteria.\n\nThe rule emphasizes these specific elements: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the \"on high alert\" phrase.  The segment has none of these, only describing potential impact and negative costs using less intense language.\n\nGiven the rigid criteria of Q2, and based strictly on the specified patterns, I must conclude that the segment *does not* meet the criteria for alarmist framing as defined by Q2.  We see a description of potential negative impact, but it's not expressed in a way that triggers the \"alarmist\" flag according to the decision tree. I will now move on to Q3."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses potential future impact ('could impose a burden', 'eventual scale') and uses plain language ('euthanizations', 'adding') rather than a moderate verb paired with explicit scale/impact from the Q3 list.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for the 'Alarmist' Frame (Q3)**\n\nOkay, here's how I see this segment and its relation to Q3 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if this portion of text triggers an \"Alarmist\" frame by checking for a moderate verb paired with explicit scale or impact information.\n\nFirst, I looked for verbs from the provided list: `hit`, `swept`, `surged`, `soared`, `plunged`, `plummeted`, `prompted`, `feared`, `fearing`, `were/was culled`.  I immediately notice that none of these verbs are present in the segment.\n\nThen, I broke it down to analyze the language used. I took note of \"depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak,\" \"subsequent euthanizations,\" \"could nonetheless impose a burden,\" and \"adding to the already-onerous costs.\"\n\n*   \"Eventual scale\" and \"could\" are immediate flags. They indicate a hypothetical scenario, a future projection, rather than a stated current or past impact.\n*   \"Euthanizations\" is a noun, derived from a verb, and importantly, it's hypothetical because it's *subsequent* to the outbreak, therefore, not yet realized.\n*   \"Impose a burden\" doesn't appear in the Q3 list of problematic verbs. It is not an active verb, and the conditional \"could\" makes it hypothetical.\n*   \"Adding to the costs\" is also passive and not in the list. The adjective \"onerous\" is describing a background condition.\n\nSo, since the segment primarily deals with potential future impacts and doesn't contain the specific verbs that Q3 is looking for, the answer is a straightforward \"no.\" I'm confident in my analysis, and it's time to move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis: Evaluating for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\" My task is to determine if this violates Q4, which focuses on loaded rhetorical questions designed to incite alarm or fear.\n\nFirst, I need to remind myself of Q4's criteria. It's looking for questions – either explicit (with question marks) or implicit (functioning as rhetorical questions) – that are intended to suggest worry or urgency, or to highlight a worrisome threat. Examples would be things like \"Should consumers worry...?\" or \"Are we simply going to stand by...?\" Neutral questions, of course, are fine, and don't trigger the violation.\n\nNow, let's look at the segment again. I'm focusing on that for any sign of a question. Scanning it, I see *no* question marks. Okay, that's step one. But, does it *function* as a rhetorical question, even without the punctuation? No. It's a straight-up declarative statement, making a point about a *potential* future burden. It's acknowledging a possible consequence, not trying to panic anyone.\n\nTherefore, since the segment doesn't contain any question at all, it simply doesn't meet the requirements of Q4.\n\nMy conclusion is clear: the answer is \"no\". And my rationale is straightforward: there are no questions in the segment whatsoever."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses potential negative economic impacts ('impose a burden on consumers' wallets') and does not contain any explicit language communicating current safety, control, or minimized risk.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Regarding Reassuring Cues (Q5)**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with examining this snippet for any explicit calming language – specifically, reassuring cues about safety, control, or minimized risk. I'm looking for phrases like \"no cause for alarm\" or \"fully under control,\" things that actively try to soothe anxieties.\n\nReading the text, I see words about the \"eventual scale of the outbreak\" and \"subsequent euthanizations,\" which clearly focus on potential *negative* consequences. It discusses a \"burden on consumers' wallets\" and \"already-onerous costs,\" painting a picture of potential economic hardship. None of this is trying to calm anyone down. It's highlighting potential issues.\n\nEssentially, the segment is future-oriented and risk-focused, not presenting any comforting information. It doesn't use any of the telltale phrases I'm looking for. Therefore, I'm confident in saying the answer to Q5 is \"no.\" I'm now ready to proceed, but as this is a single-hop prompt, my response is simply the JSON for Q5."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses potential negative impacts ('impose a burden', 'onerous costs') but does not contain a minimiser ('only', 'just', 'few') combined with a scale contrast ('out of X') to downplay the situation.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to assess this text segment against Q6 of that decision tree, specifically looking for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" reassurance pattern.  The segment is: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"\n\nAlright, let's break it down. I need to find a word that minimizes something (like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely\") *combined* with a contrast in scale (something like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions\").  This suggests an attempt to reassure by downplaying the potential scope or impact.\n\nI'm quickly scanning for those minimisers. \"However\" is just a conjunction. \"Depending on the scale\" - that's hinting at *scale*, but not minimizing it. \"Impose a burden,\" \"onerous costs,\"... all negative but no minimisers. Nope, nothing there. I'm seeing potential negative consequences tied to the *scale* of the outbreak, but it's not being softened with a minimiser. It's just a straightforward statement about potential costs depending on the outbreak's size.\n\nSo, no, I don't see any of those minimiser words. I'm also not seeing any explicit scale contrasts.  It's just talking about the *idea* of scale, not actually contrasting it with something else.\n\nGiven that I haven't found the required pattern, my answer to Q6 has to be \"no\".  The rationale should be straightforward: the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern, as defined in Q6, simply wasn't present in the text segment."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a potential negative outcome ('impose a burden', 'adding to costs') and does not contain any bare negation or statement downplaying a risk.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question 7**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\" The task is to evaluate it based on Question 7 of the decision tree, which is looking for \"bare negation\" without any calming cues.\n\nEssentially, I need to scan for phrases that explicitly negate or downplay a potential risk or problem. Think \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no evidence,\" that sort of thing.  But here, I see the opposite. The text explicitly discusses a *potential* negative outcome: it could \"impose a burden on consumers' wallets\" and \"add to the already-onerous costs.\" There's no attempt to minimize that risk.\n\nSince the segment doesn't contain any negation or downplaying language, and focuses on potential harm, I'm confident my answer to Q7 is \"no.\"  I'll just provide the necessary JSON for that."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a potential negative impact (burden on wallets) rather than capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Regarding Question Q8**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with a text segment and tasked with evaluating it against Question Q8. This question, as I understand it, is looking for statements that describe capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards *without* using active reassurance.  Let's break down my thought process:\n\nFirst, I examined the provided text: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"\n\nNow, applying my expertise, I quickly identified the core focus. The segment primarily concerns the *potential negative economic ramifications* of a future scenario – specifically, a significant H5N1 outbreak and the subsequent culling of poultry. The text highlights a possible increase in costs for consumers.\n\nNext, I went through the critical evaluation. Does this segment touch upon capabilities, preparedness measures, hopeful future possibilities, or implemented safeguards?  Absolutely not. It explicitly addresses a *possible negative outcome*. The focus is on a potential burden, a consequence, not on the ability to handle the situation, what has been prepared, or future hopes.\n\nTherefore, my ultimate conclusion is clear. The text segment fails to meet the criteria of Question Q8. Because it doesn't represent a capability, preparedness measure, safeguard, or hopeful possibility, and its focus is on a negative consequence, I can confidently say that the answer to Q8 is \"no\".\n\nFinally, I'll need to create the appropriate JSON object to reflect this assessment.  It will, of course, include `answer: \"no\"` and a short, clear explanation of why it doesn't fit the question's criteria. This will ensure my evaluation is well-documented and easily understood."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses framing language ('impose a burden', 'onerous costs') rather than standard descriptive verbs and neutral adverbs to report economic impact.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment Against Q9: Not a Case of Neutral Reporting**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking through this. I've been asked to analyze the provided text segment against the criteria of Question 9 in the decision tree. Q9 focuses on whether the segment is primarily factual reporting of prices or metrics, using standard economic verbs and neutral adverbs, and specifically *avoids* vivid verbs, risk adjectives, or explicit framing.\n\nMy initial assessment is that this segment doesn't quite fit the mold of neutral, factual reporting that Q9 is looking for. Let's break down why.\n\nThe phrase \"impose a burden on consumers' wallets\" immediately caught my attention. While it's understandable, it's not the kind of standard economic verb I'd expect in a neutral report. Standard verbs would be something more like \"increased,\" \"rose,\" or \"declined.\" This phrase is more metaphorical, implying a negative impact, and it's not a straightforward description of a price or metric change.\n\nThen, there's \"adding to the already-onerous costs.\" While \"adding to\" is acceptable, the use of \"onerous\" to describe the costs is significant. \"Onerous\" is a strong, negative adjective. It's not a neutral term like \"high,\" \"increased,\" or \"significant.\" Instead, it suggests that the costs are burdensome or difficult to bear. This is framing the situation negatively, which goes against the requirement for neutrality.\n\nComparing this to the criteria and examples in the guidelines, the use of \"impose a burden\" and \"onerous costs\" clearly indicates a deviation from standard, factual reporting. The guidelines explicitly mention that \"risk adjectives\" (like \"onerous\") are a red flag for alarmist language. Specifically, \"Risk Adjectives + Economics\" combinations like \"onerous costs\" are clearly associated with something *other than* Neutral.\n\nSo, in terms of Q9, the segment *fails*. It's not a straightforward reporting of prices or metrics using standard language without framing.  It uses metaphorical language (\"impose a burden\") and a strong negative adjective (\"onerous\") to describe the economic impact.  These cues, in my expert opinion, are enough to answer **no** to Q9.\n\nThe rationale is that the segment utilizes \"impose a burden\" and \"onerous costs,\" which are not examples of factual reporting with standard verbs and neutral adverbs. The use of a framing adjective like \"onerous\" definitively shifts the text away from a neutral presentation. This implies further analysis is necessary, and we move to the next question in the decision tree."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment speculates about a potential future negative outcome ('could nonetheless impose a burden'), not about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against Decision Tree Q10**\n\nOkay, I'm examining this text segment against Q10 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if the text speculates about potential *future relief or improvement* without any accompanying calming cue about the *current* situation.\n\nThe segment in question is: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"\n\nNow, this clearly talks about a *future* scenario, but it's a negative one. It's discussing the potential for a burden on consumers, increased costs – the opposite of relief or improvement. There's no hint of things getting better, easing, or any positive outcome being speculated about. It is speculating on a *worsening* of an already bad situation.\n\nTherefore, since the segment does *not* meet the criteria of speculating about future relief or improvement, I'm confident in saying \"no\" to Q10.\n\nI'll now move on to the next question, Q11."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no direct quotes or attributed statements from a specific source.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Direct Quotation and Framing (Q11)**\n\nOkay, here's my process. I'm given a text segment and tasked with applying Q11. My first step is to carefully read the provided segment: \"However, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\"\n\nMy expertise immediately kicks in; I'm trained to spot nuances in framing. I'm looking for direct quotations from a specific source – a journalist, scientist, or stakeholder whose words are being cited directly. A quick scan, and I see no quotation marks. There's no \"according to...\" or any explicit attribution that would signal I'm looking at someone else's statement.\n\nGiven the criteria of Q11, the answer is a clear \"no.\" The language, even with its emphasis on financial burdens, represents the author's own assessment or projection. They are not directly quoting a source. The phrasing like \"could nonetheless impose\" and \"already-onerous costs\" reflects a viewpoint, but it's not a verbatim quote. It's framing, yes, but not in the sense required by Q11.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment does not contain any direct quotes or attributed statements from a specific source. The language is authorial framing, not a direct quote.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit and sufficient Alarmist or Reassuring framing cues remain. The potential negative impact ('impose a burden', 'adding to') is described factually without explicit amplification.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Framing of Potential Economic Impact**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a sentence discussing a potential economic impact related to an outbreak and resulting actions. My task, as I understand it, is to apply the Q12 rule, which essentially means checking to see if after all prior rules were assessed, this segment defaults to a Neutral framing.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I haven't missed any obvious cues from the higher-precedence rules (Q1-Q11). I'll look for things like intensifiers combined with risk adjectives, vivid verbs, or explicit calming language.\n\nUpon reviewing the sentence, I see a few key elements: mentions of an outbreak and euthanizations, a statement that the situation \"could impose a burden,\" and reference to \"onerous costs.\" My initial thought is that this has the *potential* to be framed alarmistically, but I need to be precise.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n*   **Q1 (Intensifier + Risk Adjective):** I see \"onerous,\" but it's modifying *existing* costs, not the *new* burden imposed. The new impact is described as \"impose a burden,\" which isn't amplified. So, nothing here.\n*   **Q2 (Vivid Verb):** \"Impose a burden\" doesn't jump out as a vivid, emotionally charged verb. It's more descriptive.\n*   **Q3 (Moderate Verb + Scale/Metric):** Again, \"impose a burden\" is a moderate verb, and there's no specific scale or metric attached. We're told it *could* add to the existing burden, but not by how much or what level.\n*   **Q4 (Explicit Calming):** There's no explicit attempt to downplay the potential negative impact. No mention of resilience, solutions, etc.\n*   **Q5-Q11:** Not applicable.\n\nNow, looking at the entire context of Q12, the *potential* negative elements are there: an outbreak, euthanizations, costs, and a burden. However, the *framing* of the *new* impact (\"impose a burden\", \"adding to\") lacks the necessary explicit amplification to trigger an Alarmist frame. We're essentially presented with a *possibility* of a negative outcome. That's not the same as saying it *will* be negative or *is* amplified negative. It is the modal verb \"could\" that triggers the need for a neutral default. The facts are presented descriptively, without an overt emotional slant, even though the concepts themselves are negative.\n\nUltimately, after careful consideration and applying the Q12 rule, I determine that because there are no explicit and sufficient Alarmist or Reassuring framing cues, this segment defaults to a Neutral frame. The presentation of the potential negative facts is purely factual and descriptive."}
