{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Intensifiers and Comparatives**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment and the task of determining if it contains an intensifier or comparative adjective that directly modifies a risk-adjective, specifically as per Q1 of the 12-step decision tree. I'm looking for telltale phrases like \"so dangerous,\" \"more severe,\" or idioms like \"deadly from the start.\"\n\nFirst, I quickly scan the text: \"The first bird flu viruses... late 1990s... according to the CDC... virus variants spread throughout the world.\" Nothing immediately jumps out. I break it down a bit further. \"Leading to large outbreaks\" is interesting. \"Large\" *is* a scale, but it modifies \"outbreaks,\" not a risk-adjective. While this might trigger Q3 (Moderate Verb + Scale/Metric) later, it's not relevant here. Similarly, \"spread throughout the world\" indicates extent, but \"spread\" is a verb and \"throughout the world\" is a metric - relevant for Q2 or Q3, perhaps. But again, not what I'm looking for.\n\nAfter a thorough sweep, I find no instance of an intensifier (like \"very,\" \"extremely\") or a comparative (like \"more,\" \"less\") modifying any risk-adjective (like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous\"). Also, no use of the idiom, \"deadly from the start.\"  Therefore, after this examination, my judgment is that Q1 is definitively \"no.\""}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses moderate verbs like 'emerged,' 'leading to,' and 'spread,' none of which are high-potency verbs or part of the other Q2 patterns.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, I've been given this text segment: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\" My task is to scrutinize it based on Q2 of the decision tree, specifically looking for those red flags indicating alarmist framing. I need to check for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative/negative noun combinations, and the \"on high alert\" phrase.\n\nI'm mentally going through the defined patterns. I recognize that \"emerged\" and \"spread\" are moderate verbs, not the kind of explosive action verbs like \"ravaged\" or \"exploding\" that would raise a Q2 flag. \"Leading to large outbreaks\" and \"spread throughout the world\" are certainly concerning in terms of scale, but the verbs themselves aren't high-potency within the context of Q2. I'm also not seeing any metaphors like \"ticking time-bomb\" or \"raging inferno,\" nor any combinations like \"worst disaster\" or \"on high alert.\"\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis of the provided list and the text segment, I must conclude that the answer to Q2 is definitely \"no.\" I'm now ready to proceed with the appropriate output."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses verbs like 'emerged' and 'spread' which are not on the list of moderate verbs for Q3, despite mentioning scale ('large outbreaks', 'throughout the world').", "thoughts": "**My Assessment: Not Alarmist**\n\nOkay, so I'm running this text snippet through the decision tree, specifically checking it against Q3. That means I'm looking for \"moderate verbs\" paired with information suggesting \"significant scale or impact.\" My initial thought is to identify the verbs and their context.\n\nThe segment is: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down verb-by-verb, checking against my criteria. I'm looking for verbs like \"swept,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" \"plummeted,\" etc., the ones the tree calls \"moderate.\" My eyes are peeled for scale indicators like \"millions culled\" or \"throughout the world.\"\n\nHere's the verb breakdown: \"are believed,\" \"have emerged,\" \"leading to,\" and \"spread.\" I checked those verbs against the list. \"Are believed\" and \"have emerged\" don't fit the moderate verb category at all. \"Leading to\" isn't *quite* in the spirit of the moderate verbs, even though it suggests a consequential action. Finally, \"spread\" - it's close, but it's not explicitly in the Q3 list or the regex (`\\b(hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|(?:were|was)\\s+culled)\\b`).\n\nSo, while I see \"leading to large outbreaks\" and \"spread throughout the world,\" which *do* suggest significant impact, the verbs themselves don't meet the Q3 requirement. The rule is pretty explicit: the verb has to be one of *those* specific moderate verbs from the list.\n\nTherefore, Q3's condition isn't met. My answer is a firm \"no.\""}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Question Q4**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to assess a text segment against the criteria of Q4 in my decision tree. This means I need to look for any instance of a *loaded rhetorical question* - something specifically designed to evoke alarm.\n\nThe segment is: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"\n\nAnalyzing this, it's pretty straightforward. This is a purely *declarative* statement. It's offering a factual recounting of the origins and spread of bird flu. There aren't any questions being posed, let alone questions crafted to manipulate or instill fear.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q4 is clearly \"no.\" I will format my conclusion accordingly, with a clear explanation of my reasoning."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text describes historical events (emergence, outbreaks, spread) and does not contain any explicit calming language or assurances about current safety or control.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of Reassuring Language (Q5)**\n\nOkay, here's my analysis. The task is to determine if the provided text contains language explicitly reassuring the reader about safety, control, or minimized risk, specifically in the *present* context. The text segment is: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"\n\nMy expertise immediately flags this as historical context. I understand I need to look for phrases directly communicating a sense of calm or current minimized risk, as defined by Q5's rules.\n\nScanning the text, I see nothing explicitly reassuring. The sentences describe the *past*: the emergence of viruses, outbreaks, and spread. There are no phrases like \"no cause for alarm,\" \"public can rest easy,\" \"fully under control,\" or any of those pre-defined calming cues. This is just a historical account, albeit about potentially concerning events.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is clear: the text does *not* contain explicit calming cues related to the present situation. I'll proceed to the JSON response for Q5."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the emergence and spread of the virus but does not use a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) combined with a scale contrast to downplay its significance for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment for Reassuring Framing (Q6)**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this text snippet in relation to Q6, the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern for reassuring framing.  The user wants me to evaluate the sentence about the bird flu viruses.\n\nFirst, I quickly scan the text: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"\n\nMy initial thought is to look for those key indicators: a minimizer like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"a few,\" coupled with a scale contrast like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions.\"  I don't see any of those right off the bat.\n\nDiving deeper, I carefully examine for the patterns. I search for those specific words - the minimizers. They aren't there.  Then, I look for a scale contrast. While the text does discuss \"large outbreaks\" and the virus \"spread[ing] throughout the world,\" those phrases are used to describe the *scope* of the issue, not to minimize it. They aren't paired with a word that suggests a *limited* scope.\n\nMy expert judgment is clear: this sentence doesn't satisfy Q6.  There's no minimizer, and there's no scale contrast being used to downplay the significance of the outbreaks or spread.  Therefore, my conclusion is that the condition for Q6 is not met.\n\nThe answer is a definitive \"no\"."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes historical events (emergence, outbreaks, spread) and does not contain any bare negation statement about current risk or impact.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of Segment Against Q7**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\" and I need to evaluate it against Q7 of a decision tree. Q7's all about identifying \"bare negations\" - that is, language that minimizes or downplays risk without offering any reassurance. Think phrases like \"not expected to be a problem,\" \"unlikely to affect,\" \"no detected cases,\" etc.\n\nMy first read-through, I'm already mentally scanning for those key negative cues.  I'm looking for language that suggests a risk *isn't* a risk, essentially.\n\nNow, rereading the segment specifically, \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\" It's narrating the history of bird flu outbreaks. It discusses large outbreaks and global spread, which are definitely negative events. However, it's *describing* past events. It's not *downplaying* current or future risk. There's no \"no,\" \"not,\" \"unlikely,\" or any of those signal words. It's factual, straightforward.\n\nTherefore, applying the definition of bare negation, this segment *doesn't* contain any. It describes historical events, some of which were indeed negative, but the language used doesn't try to minimize or dismiss those events.\n\nSo, my answer to Q7 is a definitive \"no.\"\n\nAnd as for my rationale, I'd say the text segment presents historical facts regarding the emergence and spread of bird flu viruses. While these events were negative, the segment doesn't contain any negation or downplaying of associated risks or negative outcomes, thus does not qualify as a bare negation. Now, let's move on to the next question."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes historical events (emergence, outbreaks, spread) and does not mention capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Provided Text Regarding Capability/Preparedness**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess this text snippet against Question Q8, specifically looking for any statements related to capabilities or preparedness *without* any active reassurance.  Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the text. It reads: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"\n\nNow, Q8 is looking for things like \"we *can* do X,\" \"systems *are* in place,\" \"hopefully, Y will happen,\" or \"safeguards *have* been implemented.\"  The text clearly talks about the *past*. It mentions the *emergence* of the virus, significant outbreaks in the past, and its *spread*.  It's purely historical.  Crucially, it cites the CDC as a source, but doesn't *itself* claim any present-day capability or preparedness.\n\nI'm seeing no mention of vaccines, infrastructure, future improvements, or any protective measures currently in place *without* direct reassurance to the user.  The text *isn't* saying, \"Don't worry, we're ready for this now.\" or \"Everything is under control\". It's just recounting what happened in the past.\n\nTherefore, given the historical focus and the absence of any statements about present-day capability or preparedness, the answer to Q8 is definitively \"no.\" The segment doesn't touch on those elements at all.  The rationale is straightforward: it describes past events, not present-day capabilities or safeguards.\n\nFinally, I'll need to format this as a JSON object with `answer` and `rationale` keys, which should be relatively easy."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses the emergence and spread of bird flu viruses and outbreaks, not prices, economic data, or numerical metrics as defined by Q9.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this text snippet against Q9 of the decision tree. Q9, as I understand it, is looking for segments that *exclusively* present prices, economic indicators, or numerical metrics using plain, descriptive language – no flashy verbs, no risk assessments, no explicit framing.\n\nLet's break it down: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"\n\nImmediately, I recognize this is about the history of avian influenza. The focus here is the emergence and spread of a biological event, not financial data. There's no mention of market prices, economic impact, losses, rates, or any of those things Q9 is designed to identify. It's clearly a narrative of an event, and the language is descriptive but not reporting on prices, economic data, or metrics that Q9 is looking for.\n\nTherefore, the segment *definitely* doesn't fit the criteria. It's simply irrelevant to what Q9 is seeking. My answer to Q9 must be \"no.\" The rationale is straightforward: the segment isn't reporting prices, economic indicators, or numerical metrics as defined by Q9. It's a description of a biological phenomenon."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes past events (emergence, outbreaks, spread) and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Q10 Evaluation: A Thought Process**\n\nOkay, I've got a text segment to analyze against Q10 of this decision tree. The question is whether the segment speculates about *future* relief or improvement without a calming cue. My initial read of the segment focuses on past events. It's about the emergence and spread of bird flu viruses in the past, mentioning phrases like \"emerged,\" \"leading to outbreaks,\" and \"spread throughout the world.\"\n\nNone of this language directly addresses future easing, improvement, or recovery. It's strictly historical context. I'm focusing on \"future\" here, and I'm not seeing any speculation about what might happen *next*.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the segment does *not* speculate about future relief or improvement. This means my answer to Q10 is a solid \"no.\"\n\nI know the instructions say that if it's a \"no,\" I'm supposed to move to Q11. However, I'm only being asked to provide the answer for Q10 in this context.\n\nTherefore, my final judgment is \"no\". The rationale being the segment's focus on historical events, not future speculation. I need to output the JSON response for this."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment attributes information to the CDC but does not contain a direct quote or attributed statement with explicit alarmist or reassuring language.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Dominant Framed Quotation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and the task is to determine if it fails the Q11 test. This is all about looking for a \"dominant framed quotation,\" which means a direct quote or clearly attributed statement containing explicit Alarmist or Reassuring language, based on my understanding of the rules.\n\nI've carefully examined the segment: \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"\n\nMy first step was to check for a direct quote. Nothing there. Next, I looked for attributed statements. Yes, there's the phrase \"according to the CDC\". Now, the crucial part: does this attributed statement use Alarmist or Reassuring language? I looked closely at the wording: \"emerged,\" \"leading to large outbreaks,\" \"spread throughout the world\". These are factual descriptions of past events. \"Large outbreaks\" describes scale, yes, but it's presented in a historical context, not hyped with those intensifiers or vivid verbs I'm looking for. Nothing jumps out as meeting the criteria outlined in the pattern table or detailed rules.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is clear: there is no dominant framed quotation in this segment. My answer to Q11 is \"no,\" and I will now output the JSON object."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Q12 reached. The segment describes historical events (emergence, large outbreaks, global spread) using factual, descriptive language without explicit alarmist or reassuring framing cues.", "thoughts": "**Neutral Framing Evaluation of Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and I'm asked to apply the 12-step decision tree, specifically checking Q12, the \"default-to-Neutral\" check. My job is to determine if, after running through the previous Qs (Q1-Q11), we're left with a neutral frame.\n\nThe segment is \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\"\n\nMy initial thought is that I need to look for explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues. I'm going through it word by word. \"Believed to have emerged\" is epistemic language, so that's not a framing cue. \"Large outbreaks\" immediately caught my attention. While the noun \"outbreaks\" is negative, the word \"large\" functions as a descriptor. It's not a vivid intensifier like \"devastating\" or \"catastrophic.\" It's just a descriptive term of scale. The key here is the *Default-to-Neutral* rule. The rule says that factual descriptions of phenomena with negative-sounding descriptors are neutral if no further alarmist framing is added. So, \"large\" seems to be part of the factual description.\n\nNext, I see \"spread throughout the world.\" Again, this is a factual description of the geographical reach. It's not \"exploded across the globe\" or something dramatic. It's just a neutral description of how the virus moved.\n\nI then ran through the previous Qs. No intensifiers (Q1), no vivid impact verbs (Q2), no moderate verbs paired with a specific scale/metric (Q3) - \"large\" isn't a *specific* scale/metric in the same way 500,000 job losses would be - no calming language (Q4), no bare negation or capability statements (Q5).\n\nThe text is simply describing historical events and their scope: \"large outbreaks\" and the geographical extent, \"spread throughout the world\". While those are inherently negative events, the language is descriptive. It’s a factual account. The crucial thing is that there isn't any extra language to amplify the threat. Describing something factually as a \"large outbreak\" and global spread doesn't, in itself, lead to an alarmist frame, according to the rules and examples provided.\n\nBased on the default-to-Neutral rule and the examples provided, the description is factual and descriptive. Therefore, I conclude that Q12 applies, and the framing is Neutral."}
