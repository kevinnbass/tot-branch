{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'highly' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Framing: Q1 Check**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment, \"Health officials announced Monday that they detected a highly contagious strain of bird flu in two additional U.S. states, furthering a threat to the country's poultry industry.\" and I need to see if it triggers an \"Alarmist\" frame based on the first question of this decision tree. This Q1 looks for \"Intensifier + Risk-Adjective\" combinations.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. I can see the phrase \"highly contagious\" in there. Let's see... \"highly\" is definitely an intensifier, falling in line with the examples I know: \"so,\" \"very,\" \"extremely,\" and so on. Now, \"contagious\" clearly describes a risk, right? It indicates the potential for spread, which definitely implies a risk. I'm familiar with risk-adjectives: \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" are obvious examples, and \"contagious\" fits. \"Highly\" directly modifies \"contagious,\" matching the `Intensifier + Risk-Adjective` pattern exactly.\n\nI also notice that there is a \"technical-term guard\" for \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI),\" but that isn't used here. The text specifically calls it a \"highly contagious strain\", so the guard isn't relevant.\n\nBased on that, I can confidently say that the answer to Q1 is \"yes\". It's a clear match.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes\",\n  \"rationale\": \"Cue: \\\"highly contagious\\\"\"\n}\n```"}
