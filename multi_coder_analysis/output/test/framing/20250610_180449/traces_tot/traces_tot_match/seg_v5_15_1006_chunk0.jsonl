{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a factual procedure ('quarantined') and mentions 'HPAI', which is excluded by the technical-term guard for Q1.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Evaluation: No Intensifier/Comparative Modifying a Risk-Adjective**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment about farms being quarantined after an HPAI outbreak. My task is to see if it triggers Q1 of the decision tree, which is all about intensifiers and comparatives modifying risk adjectives.  I know this drill.\n\nFirst, I see \"HPAI\" – right away, I recall the rule. \"Highly pathogenic\" as part of the *name* of the disease is generally neutral, unless there are other red flags.  Good to keep in mind.\n\nThen I read the segment again.  \"Quarantined\" is the key verb, but it's factual; it's a procedural description.  It's not a risk-adjective.  I'm looking for things like \"very dangerous\" or \"more contagious\".  Nothing like that here. I scan for intensifiers (\"so,\" \"very,\" \"extremely\") or comparatives (\"more,\" \"less,\" \"deadlier\"). Nope, nothing. No \"deadly from the start\" idiom either.\n\nSo, Q1 is a clear \"no.\" No intensifiers or comparatives modifying a risk-adjective.  I can confidently move on to the next question.  Now, to create the correct JSON, I will indicate my conclusion and rationale for not finding the pattern."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the factual term 'quarantined' which is not a high-potency verb, potent metaphor, superlative-negative noun, or critical alert phrase.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: A Clean Bill of Health**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze: \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA.\" My task is to see if it triggers any red flags according to Question Q2. That means I'm looking for a specific linguistic profile: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative noun pairings, or the \"on high alert\" phrase, all indicators of alarmist framing.\n\nLet's break it down: First, the verbs. Are there any heavy hitters like \"devastated\" or \"skyrocketed\"? Nope. The verb \"quarantined\" is present, but that's a straightforward technical term. It's a procedural descriptor, not an emotionally charged one.\n\nNext, I'm scanning for any superlative-negative noun combinations, like \"worst disaster.\" Nothing. And the \"on high alert\" phrase? Absent. Finally, I'm checking for potent metaphors – no \"ticking time bombs\" here either.\n\nBased on this careful review, there are zero Q2 triggers in this segment. The language is factual and neutral. My answer to Question Q2 is a definitive \"no\". This looks like a standard operating procedure description, not an attempt to create undue alarm."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses factual verbs ('is found', 'are quarantined') and provides no information about scale or impact, failing the Q3 criteria.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for the Alarmist Frame**\n\nOkay, I'm examining this text snippet, \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA,\" to see if it triggers Q3 of the 12-step decision tree. My goal here is to determine if it uses an alarmist frame, looking specifically for \"moderate verbs\" paired with \"significant scale or impact\" information.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the verbs. I see \"is found\" and \"are quarantined.\" Neither of these immediately strikes me as alarmist. I'm looking for verbs like `hit`, `swept`, `surged`, or `plunged` that indicate a dramatic impact.  Neither \"is found\" (a passive statement of fact) nor \"are quarantined\" (a standard containment procedure) fits the bill.  Both are factual and neutral verbs.\n\nNext, I'm scanning for any information about the scale or impact. Are we talking about millions of birds? Record losses? Overwhelmed systems? No. This segment doesn't provide any quantitative data or impactful descriptions. It simply states a quarantine process.\n\nSince there are no qualifying verbs and no associated scale/impact data, Q3's conditions aren't met. My answer is \"no\". This segment doesn't use an alarmist frame according to the Q3 criteria. I'll move on to the next question, but for now, I'm done here."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement describing a procedure, not a loaded rhetorical question.", "thoughts": "**Q4 Evaluation: No Loaded Rhetorical Question Detected**\n\nOkay, I'm analyzing this text segment, \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA,\" against Q4 of the decision tree. The goal is to determine if it contains any loaded rhetorical questions meant to instill alarm.\n\nLooking at the text, it's pretty clear this is a straightforward declarative statement about USDA policy. There are no question marks, no questioning syntax, and no attempt to frame something as a disguised query.  The text *states* a fact.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q4 is unequivocally \"no.\" The rationale is simple: the segment is a factual statement, not a question, let alone a loaded rhetorical one. My task is complete with this determination, and I need to proceed to the next question, Q5."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states a factual procedure (quarantine) but lacks explicit calming language or intensified low-risk evaluation.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this short text snippet, \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA,\" against Q5. Q5 is looking for explicit calming cues that reassure the audience about present safety, control, or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is to go through the checklist. Does it contain the tell-tale phrases or patterns? No, I don't see any direct reassurance like \"don't worry,\" \"completely safe,\" or the amplified low-risk statements I'm looking for. It just states a fact about USDA's quarantine procedure.\n\nIt's a standard control measure, sure, but it's not *framed* in a way that directly tries to soothe the audience's concerns. Quarantine is a response, not a promise. It doesn't use any calming language or positive spin to emphasize present safety to the public.\n\nTherefore, no, it's not a Q5 hit. I need to generate the JSON response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"Reports standard procedure, not explicit calming cue about safety.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment 'Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA' contains neither a minimiser nor a scale contrast element required for Q6.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of Reassurance Pattern Q6**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user wants me to analyze this text segment, *\"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA,\"* against the criteria for Reassurance Pattern Q6. Basically, they're looking for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern. This pattern requires two things: a minimizer like \"only\" or \"just,\" and a scaling contrast phrase, something like \"out of thousands.\"\n\nI carefully broke down the segment, pinpointing the subject (farms with HPAI) and the action (quarantine by USDA). Then, I went hunting for the components of the \"Minimizer + Scale Contrast\" pattern. I looked specifically for minimizers first, but there weren't any instances of \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" or any related terms. Then, I looked for scale contrasts like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions.\" No dice there either.\n\nTherefore, since neither a minimizer nor a scale contrast element is present in this segment, I have to conclude that the answer to Q6 is a firm \"no.\" No pattern match. I'm ready to move on, but the instructions only requested Q6's output."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes an action ('are automatically quarantined') and does not contain a bare negation.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants me to assess \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA\" against Question Q7, specifically looking for a \"bare negation\" without any calming cues.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the segment itself. It's stating a consequence: if HPAI is found, quarantine *automatically* happens. Now, Q7 targets those tricky *negations*. I scan the sentence – no \"not,\" \"no,\" \"unlikely,\" or any of those negative words are present.\n\nNext, I need to consider Q7 directly. Does this segment fit the \"bare negation\" profile? No. This isn't negating anything; it's describing an action. There's no risk being negated or problematic fact that is denied without explanation. The quarantine is presented as a straightforward, automatic response.\n\nSo, logically, Q7's answer is \"no.\" This sentence doesn't contain a bare negation. Now, I'll package this up in the JSON format with the answer and my clear reasoning. Easy enough!"}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Describes a safeguard ('automatically quarantined') without explicitly linking it to current calm or safety.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text \"Farms where HPAI is found are automatically quarantined by USDA\" and tasked with assessing it against Question Q8 of that decision tree. My initial thought is to break down the text to understand its core meaning.\n\nFirst, I see the core action described is \"quarantined,\" which immediately signals a *process* or a *safeguard* being implemented. The mention of the \"USDA\" clearly indicates that an official body is taking this action. I then need to carefully check if the text explicitly reassures us about safety, current calm, or minimized risk. Does it tell me to relax, that things are safe *right now*? No, not at all. It simply states that quarantining happens automatically when HPAI is detected.\n\nNow, I compare this back to Q8. The question specifically asks about text describing capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards *without* active reassurance. This segment perfectly fits that description. We have a safeguard (quarantine) with no explicit reassurance. Based on my expertise, I'm confident that the answer to Q8 is indeed \"yes.\" Per the decision tree, and considering the Precedence Ladder, a \"yes\" to Q8 would lead to a Neutral frame. I'll need to format my output as a JSON object with the answer and a clear rationale, stating that it describes a safeguard without explicit reassurance."}
