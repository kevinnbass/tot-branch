{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the phrase 'highly lethal', which is an intensifier ('highly') directly modifying a risk-adjective ('lethal').", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment for Claim Framing: Q1**\n\nOkay, so I've been given a text segment and need to assess it based on the first question of this 12-step decision tree for claim framing. This first question, Q1, is pretty straightforward: it's looking for the presence of an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective.  The specific segment I'm working with is: \"They [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\"\n\nMy task is to look for that `(intensifier|comparative) + risk-adjective` pattern.  Right away, I see it: \"highly lethal.\"  Let's break it down: \"highly\" – that's definitely an intensifier. And \"lethal\" – yep, that's specifically listed as a risk-adjective in the examples and rules.\n\nThe rules are clear on this.  \"Highly lethal\" is a *direct* example of what we're looking for, and it immediately flags the \"Alarmist\" frame.  The regex pattern confirms this: it includes \"highly\" followed by a variety of risk adjectives, including \"lethal.\"  I even double-checked the \"Technical-term guard\" just in case, but \"highly lethal\" isn't part of any of the specific neutral exceptions.\n\nSo, it's a clear match. \"Highly lethal\" ticks the box for Q1.  The answer to the question is unequivocally \"yes\".  The process mandates that if I get a \"yes\" at Q1, I stop there and declare the associated frame. In this case, that frame is Alarmist.  The rationale, as per the protocol, should directly quote the decisive cue, which is \"highly lethal\".\n\nTherefore, I'm confident in my conclusion and ready to format the results as JSON."}
