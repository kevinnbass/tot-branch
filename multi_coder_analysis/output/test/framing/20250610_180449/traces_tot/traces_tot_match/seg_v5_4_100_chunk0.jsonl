{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the intensifier 'so' modifying the risk-adjective 'infectious'.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and tasked with evaluating it against the first question of the decision tree. Q1 is all about spotting intensifiers or comparatives directly modifying risk-adjectives. I'm focusing on finding the pattern \"intensifier + risk-adjective\" or \"comparative + risk-adjective\" where the risk-adjectives are things like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" etc.\n\nIn this segment, I immediately see \"so infectious\" and \"deadly.\" \"So\" is an intensifier, and \"infectious\" is a synonym for \"contagious,\" which is on the list of risk-adjectives.  The phrase \"so infectious\" matches the desired pattern. While \"deadly\" itself isn't directly modified, the presence of *any* match is enough to trigger the \"yes\" answer. Therefore, I've got my answer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment contains the intensifier 'so' modifying the risk-adjective 'infectious'.\"\n}\n```"}
