virus, after dozens recently tested positive for the flu along the East Coast, Reuters reported.\n\n### Segment 2 (ID: seg_v5_13_101_chunk0)\nSo far, no cases of H5N1 infection have been found among them, the C.D.C. said.\n\n### Segment 3 (ID: seg_v5_20_101_chunk0)\nBecause of the mandated culling of infected flocks, experts say, the virus is primarily an animal health issue at this time.\n\n### Segment 4 (ID: seg_v5_22_101_chunk0)\nCan I expect to pay more for poultry products?\n\n### Segment 5 (ID: seg_v5_24_101_chunk0)\nRecently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 6 (ID: seg_v5_25_101_chunk0)\nIf infections course through more flocks, experts said, there could be some shortages of eggs.\n\n### Segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_26_101_chunk0)\nPrices for white and dark chicken meat were also rising, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_27_101_chunk0)\nExperts also warned that turkey prices could also become more volatile.\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_30_101_chunk0)\nOutbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_34_101_chunk0)\nAn commercial egg production facility in Buena Vista County, Iowa, constituted the largest infected flock and was made up of more than 5.3 million chickens, the U.S.D.A. said.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_38_101_chunk0)\nThe outbreak in 2014 and 2015 in the United States was blamed for $3 billion in losses to the agricultural sector and was considered to be the most destructive in the nation's history.\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_39_101_chunk0)\nNearly 50 million birds died, either from the virus or from having to be culled, a majority of them in Iowa or Minnesota.\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_40_101_chunk0)\nThe footprint of the current outbreak, extending from the Midwest and Plains to northern New England, has raised concerns.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_1_101_chunk0)\nMore than 15 million chickens and turkeys from infected commercial and backyard flocks in 19 states have been killed, officials said.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID: seg_v5_4_101_chunk0)\nBetter known as the bird flu, avian influenza is a highly contagious and deadly virus that can prey on chickens, turkeys and wild birds, including ducks and geese.\n\n### Segment 16 (ID: seg_v5_5_101_chunk0)\nIt [Avian influenza] spreads via nasal secretions, saliva and fecal droppings, which experts say makes it [spread] difficult to contain.\n\n### Segment 17 (ID: seg_v5_7_101_chunk0)\nThe virus, Eurasian H5N1, is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_8_101_chunk0)\nIts prevalence in the United States is not unexpected, with outbreaks previously reported in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_9_101_chunk0)\nShould humans be worried about being infected?\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_013_1010_chunk0)\nNo human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses have been detected to date in the United States.'\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_014_1010_chunk0)\nHowever, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_015_1010_chunk0)\nNonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak [of H5N1].\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_41_101_chunk0)\nI think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_42_101_chunk0)\nWhat can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_45_101_chunk0)\nSharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus.\n\n### Segment 26 (ID: seg_v5_46_101_chunk0)\nSo can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting.\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_49_101_chunk0)\nIs it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys?\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_50_101_chunk0)\nInfected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_51_101_chunk0)\nThe virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_001_1010_chunk0)\nCases of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in Indiana, Virginia, and Kentucky, posing a likely threat to the United States' domestic supply of chicken and turkey this winter.\n\n\n#

  "thoughts": "**Analyzing Segments for Neutral Economic Reporting (Q9)**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this: the task is to apply Q9 to a set of segments. Q9 is looking for segments that primarily report prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs and potentially neutral adverbs. Importantly, these reports should *not* employ vivid/potent verbs, risk adjectives, or explicitly alarmist/reassuring framing.\n\nI need to go through each segment carefully and decide if it meets these criteria. I'll make a decision for each segment, provide the rationale, and then summarize my findings.\n\n*   **Segments 1-4:** These segments all deal with the spread of the virus and related issues. They don't report any economic data or prices, so they're all \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 5:** This one reports the \"average price of eggs *trending sharply higher*.\" This *is* reporting a price metric using standard reporting – a neutral verb (\"trending\") and a neutral adverb (\"sharply\"). This *is* a \"Yes.\"\n*   **Segment 6:** This discusses *potential* egg shortages. Not actual prices, so \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 7:** \"Prices for chicken meat *were also rising*.\" This *is* reporting prices using a standard verb (\"rising\"), so \"Yes.\"\n*   **Segment 8:** This states prices \"could also become more volatile.\" While \"volatile\" sounds risky, Q9 considers this acceptable when paired with modal verbs. This *is* a \"Yes.\"\n*   **Segments 9-10:** These deal with outbreaks and infected flocks. They're not about economic data, so \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 11:** Reports \"$3 billion in losses.\" While there's a phrase about the outbreak being \"most destructive,\" the core of the reporting is the *factual* $3 billion loss amount. This fits Q9. It's a \"Yes.\"\n*   **Segments 12-20, 22-30:** All of these are focused on the virus spread, symptoms, and containment. Not economic, so \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 21:** Discusses burdens and \"already-onerous costs.\" \"Onerous\" is a risk adjective. This is a \"No.\"\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I have identified four segments that meet Q9's criteria: segments 5, 7, 8, and 11. I'll now proceed to output the JSON structure requested.\n"
