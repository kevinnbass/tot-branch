The quoted expert states a technical capability and timeline for a hypothetical future event. This statement lacks explicit calming or risk-minimizing language from the source (e.g., no 'fortunately,' 'this makes us very safe,' 'this is excellent news for our current preparedness,' 'the public can be reassured by this speed') to actively frame this capability as a reason for reassurance about existing or imminent risks.\"\n\n**Minimal Pair Examples:**\n* **Neutral:** \"The agency has developed a rapid deployment plan for emergencies.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Neutral. States a capability. No explicit framing linking it to current reassurance.\"\n* **Reassuring:** \"The agency's new rapid deployment plan is a game-changer, meaning that in the event of an emergency, the public can rest assured that help will arrive swiftly and effectively, significantly reducing any potential danger.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Reassuring (Author-driven). Author explicitly links the plan to 'rest assured,' 'swiftly and effectively,' and 'significantly reducing potential danger.' Decisive cues: 'rest assured,' 'significantly reducing potential danger'.\"\n* **Neutral:** \"Quote: 'We have stockpiled 30 million doses of the antiviral.'\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Neutral. Quoted source states a fact about preparedness. Lacks explicit language from the source framing this as a reason for current public calm or safety.\"\n* **Reassuring:** \"Quote: 'We have stockpiled 30 million doses of the antiviral, which is excellent news and means our citizens are very well protected against any immediate threat from this virus.'\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Reassuring (Quote-driven). Quoted source explicitly frames the stockpile as 'excellent news' and a reason for being 'very well protected against any immediate threat.' Decisive cues: 'excellent news,' 'very well protected'.\"\n\n**Common LLM Misinterpretations & How to Avoid Them:**\n**Confusing Capability/Preparedness Statements with Active Reassurance:** Describing safeguards, capabilities, or control measures is Neutral unless explicitly framed as a reason for current calm or minimized risk.

virus, after dozens recently tested positive for the flu along the East Coast, Reuters reported.\n\n### Segment 2 (ID: seg_v5_10_1000_chunk0)\nAPHIS urged Americans involved with poultry production from small-scale backyard operations to large commercial environments to review their biosecurity activities and prevent contact between their birds and wild bird populations.\n\n### Segment 3 (ID: seg_v5_12_101_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it [CDC] had been monitoring people in the United States who were exposed to infected poultry and other birds.\n\n### Segment 4 (ID: seg_v5_13_101_chunk0)\nSo far, no cases of H5N1 infection have been found among them, the C.D.C. said.\n\n### Segment 5 (ID: seg_v5_16_101_chunk0)\nUnder federal guidelines, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, part of the U.S.D.A., is responsible for inspecting all poultry sold in interstate and foreign commerce.\n\n### Segment 6 (ID: seg_v5_17_101_chunk0)\nInspectors are required to be present at all times during the slaughtering process, according to the service, which noted that the inspectors have unfettered access to those facilities.\n\n### Segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_18_101_chunk0)\nEgg-production facilities that are subject to federal regulation are required to undergo daily inspections once per shift, according to the inspection service.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_19_101_chunk0)\nState inspection programs, which inspect poultry products sold only within the state they were produced, are additionally monitored by the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_20_101_chunk0)\nBecause of the mandated culling of infected flocks, experts say, the virus is primarily an animal health issue at this time.\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_21_101_chunk0)\nStill, the U.S.D.A. recommends cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 Fahrenheit to reduce the potential for food-borne illness.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_22_101_chunk0)\nCan I expect to pay more for poultry products?\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_24_101_chunk0)\nRecently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_25_101_chunk0)\nIf infections course through more flocks, experts said, there could be some shortages of eggs.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_26_101_chunk0)\nPrices for white and dark chicken meat were also rising, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID: seg_v5_27_101_chunk0)\nExperts also warned that turkey prices could also become more volatile.\n\n### Segment 16 (ID: seg_v5_28_101_chunk0)\nTesting for the avian flu typically involves swabbing the mouths and tracheal area of chickens and turkeys.\n\n### Segment 17 (ID: seg_v5_29_101_chunk0)\nThe samples are sent to diagnostic labs to be analyzed.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_30_101_chunk0)\nOutbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_33_101_chunk0)\nA spokesman for the U.S.D.A. confirmed that those birds would be required to be euthanized to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_34_101_chunk0)\nAn commercial egg production facility in Buena Vista County, Iowa, constituted the largest infected flock and was made up of more than 5.3 million chickens, the U.S.D.A. said.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_38_101_chunk0)\nThe outbreak in 2014 and 2015 in the United States was blamed for $3 billion in losses to the agricultural sector and was considered to be the most destructive in the nation's history.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_39_101_chunk0)\nNearly 50 million birds died, either from the virus or from having to be culled, a majority of them in Iowa or Minnesota.\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_40_101_chunk0)\nThe footprint of the current outbreak, extending from the Midwest and Plains to northern New England, has raised concerns.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_1_101_chunk0)\nMore than 15 million chickens and turkeys from infected commercial and backyard flocks in 19 states have been killed, officials said.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_4_101_chunk0)\nBetter known as the bird flu, avian influenza is a highly contagious and deadly virus that can prey on chickens, turkeys and wild birds, including ducks and geese.\n\n### Segment 26 (ID: seg_v5_5_101_chunk0)\nIt [Avian influenza] spreads via nasal secretions, saliva and fecal droppings, which experts say makes it [spread] difficult to contain.\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_7_101_chunk0)\nThe virus, Eurasian H5N1, is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry.\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_8_101_chunk0)\nIts prevalence in the United States is not unexpected, with outbreaks previously reported in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_9_101_chunk0)\nShould humans be worried about being infected?\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_013_1010_chunk0)\nNo human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses have been detected to date in the United States.'\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_014_1010_chunk0)\nHowever, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_015_1010_chunk0)\nNonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak [of H5N1].\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_016_1010_chunk0)\nNonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak. However, these restrictions [on imports] may be short-lived, as the supply chain crunch for poultry is being felt around the globe, and HPAI viruses have sporadically emerged throughout the world in the past two years.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_41_101_chunk0)\nI think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_42_101_chunk0)\nWhat can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\n\n### Segment 36 (ID: seg_v5_43_101_chunk0)\nAs early as last year, the U.S.D.A. warned of the likelihood of an outbreak of the avian flu and emphasized a hardening of 'biosecurity' measures to protect flocks of chickens and turkeys.\n\n### Segment 37 (ID: seg_v5_44_101_chunk0)\nBiosecurity measures include limiting access to the flocks and requiring farm workers to practice strict hygiene measures like wearing disposable boots and coveralls.\n\n### Segment 38 (ID: seg_v5_45_101_chunk0)\nSharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus.\n\n### Segment 39 (ID: seg_v5_46_101_chunk0)\nSo can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting.\n\n### Segment 40 (ID: seg_v5_48_101_chunk0)\nAt this point, every person producing poultry has to be considering how to improve their biosecurity.'\n\n### Segment 41 (ID: seg_v5_49_101_chunk0)\nIs it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys?\n\n### Segment 42 (ID: seg_v5_50_101_chunk0)\nInfected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 43 (ID: seg_v5_51_101_chunk0)\nThe virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\n\n### Segment 44 (ID: seg_v5_001_1010_chunk0)\nCases of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in Indiana, Virginia, and Kentucky, posing a likely threat to the United States' domestic supply of chicken and turkey this winter.\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)\n#  -----------------------------------------------------------\n✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**\n1.

Q8 is looking for segments that describe capabilities, preparedness, future possibilities, or safeguards without explicitly linking them to current calm, safety, or minimized present risk.
