The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)\n\n**Clarification on \"deadly,\" \"fatal,\" \"lethal\":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added Monday that these virus detections [of bird flu] do not present an immediate public health concern.\n\n### Segment 2 (ID: seg_v5_9_1000_chunk0)\nAuthorities believe wild birds have been spreading the virus, after dozens recently tested positive for the flu along the East Coast, Reuters reported.\n\n### Segment 3 (ID: seg_v5_10_1000_chunk0)\nAPHIS urged Americans involved with poultry production from small-scale backyard operations to large commercial environments to review their biosecurity activities and prevent contact between their birds and wild bird populations.\n\n### Segment 4 (ID: seg_v5_11_101_chunk0)\nIt's [getting this virus] not impossible for humans to get this virus, but it's [getting this virus] been pretty rare,' Professor Kean said.\n\n### Segment 5 (ID: seg_v5_12_101_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it [CDC] had been monitoring people in the United States who were exposed to infected poultry and other birds.\n\n### Segment 6 (ID: seg_v5_13_101_chunk0)\nSo far, no cases of H5N1 infection have been found among them, the C.D.C. said.\n\n### Segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_14_101_chunk0)\nYes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has said that properly prepared and cooked poultry and eggs should not pose a risk to consumers.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_15_101_chunk0)\nThe chance of infected poultry entering the food chain is 'extremely low,' the agency [USDA] has said.\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_16_101_chunk0)\nUnder federal guidelines, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, part of the U.S.D.A., is responsible for inspecting all poultry sold in interstate and foreign commerce.\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_17_101_chunk0)\nInspectors are required to be present at all times during the slaughtering process, according to the service, which noted that the inspectors have unfettered access to those facilities.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_18_101_chunk0)\nEgg-production facilities that are subject to federal regulation are required to undergo daily inspections once per shift, according to the inspection service.\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_19_101_chunk0)\nState inspection programs, which inspect poultry products sold only within the state they were produced, are additionally monitored by the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_20_101_chunk0)\nBecause of the mandated culling of infected flocks, experts say, the virus is primarily an animal health issue at this time.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_21_101_chunk0)\nStill, the U.S.D.A. recommends cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 Fahrenheit to reduce the potential for food-borne illness.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID: seg_v5_22_101_chunk0)\nCan I expect to pay more for poultry products?\n\n### Segment 16 (ID: seg_v5_23_101_chunk0)\nEgg prices soared when an outbreak ravaged the United States in 2014 and 2015.\n\n### Segment 17 (ID: seg_v5_24_101_chunk0)\nRecently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_25_101_chunk0)\nIf infections course through more flocks, experts said, there could be some shortages of eggs.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_26_101_chunk0)\nPrices for white and dark chicken meat were also rising, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_27_101_chunk0)\nExperts also warned that turkey prices could also become more volatile.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_28_101_chunk0)\nTesting for the avian flu typically involves swabbing the mouths and tracheal area of chickens and turkeys.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_29_101_chunk0)\nThe samples are sent to diagnostic labs to be analyzed.\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_30_101_chunk0)\nOutbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_31_101_chunk0)\nAs of March 31, the highly pathogenic form of the avian flu had been detected in 19 states, a tracking page maintained by the U.S.D.A. showed.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_32_101_chunk0)\nThe combined number of birds in the infected flocks -- the commercial and backyard type -- totaled more than 17 million, according to the agency.\n\n### Segment 26 (ID: seg_v5_33_101_chunk0)\nA spokesman for the U.S.D.A. confirmed that those birds would be required to be euthanized to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_34_101_chunk0)\nAn commercial egg production facility in Buena Vista County, Iowa, constituted the largest infected flock and was made up of more than 5.3 million chickens, the U.S.D.A. said.\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_35_101_chunk0)\nA producer of eggs in Jefferson County, Wis., was next on the list, with more than 2.7 million chickens.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_36_101_chunk0)\nA commercial poultry flock in New Castle County, Del., was the third-largest infected flock, with more than 1.1 million chickens.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_37_101_chunk0)\nHow do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_38_101_chunk0)\nThe outbreak in 2014 and 2015 in the United States was blamed for $3 billion in losses to the agricultural sector and was considered to be the most destructive in the nation's history.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_39_101_chunk0)\nNearly 50 million birds died, either from the virus or from having to be culled, a majority of them in Iowa or Minnesota.\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_40_101_chunk0)\nThe footprint of the current outbreak, extending from the Midwest and Plains to northern New England, has raised concerns.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_1_101_chunk0)\nMore than 15 million chickens and turkeys from infected commercial and backyard flocks in 19 states have been killed, officials said.\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_2_101_chunk0)\nFrom Wyoming to Maine, an outbreak of the highly contagious bird flu has swept across farms and backyard flocks in the United States this year, prompting millions of chickens and turkeys to be culled.\n\n### Segment 36 (ID: seg_v5_3_101_chunk0)\nIowa has been particularly hard hit, with disasters being declared in some counties and the state canceling live bird exhibits in an order that may affect its famed state fair.\n\n### Segment 37 (ID: seg_v5_4_101_chunk0)\nBetter known as the bird flu, avian influenza is a highly contagious and deadly virus that can prey on chickens, turkeys and wild birds, including ducks and geese.\n\n### Segment 38 (ID: seg_v5_5_101_chunk0)\nIt [Avian influenza] spreads via nasal secretions, saliva and fecal droppings, which experts say makes it [spread] difficult to contain.\n\n### Segment 39 (ID: seg_v5_6_101_chunk0)\nSymptoms of the virus include a sudden increase in the mortality of a flock, a drop in egg production and diminished consumption of feed and water.\n\n### Segment 40 (ID: seg_v5_7_101_chunk0)\nThe virus, Eurasian H5N1, is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry.\n\n### Segment 41 (ID: seg_v5_8_101_chunk0)\nIts prevalence in the United States is not unexpected, with outbreaks previously reported in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.\n\n### Segment 42 (ID: seg_v5_9_101_chunk0)\nShould humans be worried about being infected?\n\n### Segment 43 (ID: seg_v5_10_101_chunk0)\nThe risk to humans is very low, said Ron Kean, a faculty associate and extension specialist in the University of Wisconsin at Madison department of animal and dairy sciences.\n\n### Segment 44 (ID: seg_v5_011_1010_chunk0)\nFortunately for consumers, these avian flus [HPAI viruses] are rarely transmissible to humans, and there is no evidence that the virus [H5N1] can spread to humans through the consumption of infected poultry.\n\n### Segment 45 (ID: seg_v5_013_1010_chunk0)\nNo human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses have been detected to date in the United States.'\n\n### Segment 46 (ID: seg_v5_014_1010_chunk0)\nHowever, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\n\n### Segment 47 (ID: seg_v5_015_1010_chunk0)\nNonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak [of H5N1].\n\n### Segment 48 (ID: seg_v5_016_1010_chunk0)\nNonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak. However, these restrictions [on imports] may be short-lived, as the supply chain crunch for poultry is being felt around the globe, and HPAI viruses have sporadically emerged throughout the world in the past two years.\n\n### Segment 49 (ID: seg_v5_41_101_chunk0)\nI think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n### Segment 50 (ID: seg_v5_42_101_chunk0)\nWhat can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\n\n### Segment 51 (ID: seg_v5_43_101_chunk0)\nAs early as last year, the U.S.D.A. warned of the likelihood of an outbreak of the avian flu and emphasized a hardening of 'biosecurity' measures to protect flocks of chickens and turkeys.\n\n### Segment 52 (ID: seg_v5_44_101_chunk0)\nBiosecurity measures include limiting access to the flocks and requiring farm workers to practice strict hygiene measures like wearing disposable boots and coveralls.\n\n### Segment 53 (ID: seg_v5_45_101_chunk0)\nSharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus.\n\n### Segment 54 (ID: seg_v5_46_101_chunk0)\nSo can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting.\n\n### Segment 55 (ID: seg_v5_48_101_chunk0)\nAt this point, every person producing poultry has to be considering how to improve their biosecurity.'\n\n### Segment 56 (ID: seg_v5_49_101_chunk0)\nIs it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys?\n\n### Segment 57 (ID: seg_v5_50_101_chunk0)\nInfected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 58 (ID: seg_v5_51_101_chunk0)\nThe virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks.\n\n### Segment 59 (ID: seg_v5_001_1010_chunk0)\nCases of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in Indiana, Virginia, and Kentucky, posing a likely threat to the United States' domestic supply of chicken and turkey this winter.\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop logic)\n#  -----------------------------------------------------------\n✅ **SELF-AUDIT before you reply**\n1.
