{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'contagious'.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: Alarmist Framing Detected**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The user wants me to run this snippet: \"The virus is so contagious, experts say, that there is little choice but to cull infected flocks\" through the Q1 rule.  My job is to figure out if it's an \"Alarmist\" frame.\n\nLet's see. The Q1 rule is looking for an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective.  I can spot the intensifier \"so\" and the risk-adjective \"contagious\" right away in the segment. And, yeah, \"so\" is definitely modifying \"contagious.\" The rule even *specifically* lists \"so\" as an intensifier and \"contagious\" as a risk-adjective.  We're looking for that \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj\" pattern.  This is a slam dunk.\n\nThe cue is right there: \"so contagious.\"  Perfect match.  The regex pattern hits, and the answer to Q1 has to be \"yes.\" The frame is definitely \"Alarmist.\"\n"}
