Bingo!  \"Deadly\" is a risk-adjective, but it's not directly modified by an intensifier or comparative in this phrase.\n\nThe rule emphasizes that a *single* match is sufficient.  \"Highly contagious\" ticks that box.  Now, I need to double-check against those technical term guards.  There's a note about \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\". However, the segment uses \"highly contagious,\" not \"highly pathogenic.\" The guard specifically calls out \"highly pathogenic,\" so I'm good on that front.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, I've run the regex pattern. It confirms my initial assessment. The `highly(?!\\s+pathogenic...)` portion explicitly includes \"highly\" unless it's followed by that specific HPAI phrase.

Finally, I consider whether there's a risk adjective present. Ah, \"worried\" *does* relate to risk or concern, doesn't it? But, the structure here is \"be worried about,\" a standard expression of concern. It isn't modified by an intensifier or a comparative adjective to pump up the risk level.

There are no overtly alarmist verbs or metaphors that *describe the infection itself or its ramifications*.

Hmm, neither \"was\" nor \"infected\" match anything on that list, which includes verbs like \"hit,\" \"swept,\" \"surged,\" etc.\n\nNow, let's consider scale.

A \"minimiser\" – words like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few.\"  These words downplay the significance of something.\n2.  An explicit or implied contrast, suggesting a larger context, like \"out of thousands\" or \"among millions,\" putting the minimiser into perspective.\n\nExamining the segment, \"How do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\" I can see right away that it *doesn't* contain any of the minimiser words I'm looking for.

I'm specifically looking for terms like \"ravaged,\" \"nightmare,\" \"worst disaster,\" or anything indicating immediate danger.\n\nLooking closer, the language here is remarkably neutral and factual. \"Was next on the list\" is simply a statement of sequence, and the \"2.7 million chickens\" is a quantifiable detail.  While the scale is significant, the manner in which it's presented is purely descriptive and lacks any connotation of alarm.

Let's see... Q3 is all about identifying those \"moderate verbs\" that tell us about real impact, especially when paired with a big number or description of size. The text here says \"A producer of eggs in Jefferson County, Wis., was next on the list, with more than 2.7 million chickens.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look for those moderate verbs. The list includes things like \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" \"plummeted,\" and so on.  Right away, I see the sentence uses \"was next on the list.\"  That *isn't* a moderate verb from my list. It tells me where the producer is on a list, but not specifically what happened to the chickens.  It also states the producer *had* 2.7 million chickens. This doesn't mean something bad happened *to* them in this particular sentence.\n\nNext, I look for a significant scale or impact.  \"More than 2.7 million chickens\" definitely qualifies! That's a huge number.  But here's the crucial point:  *I need the moderate verb and the impact-describing quantity to be directly linked*.  The sentence doesn't say anything like \"the chickens were culled,\" \"the chickens plummeted,\" or \"the chickens were hard hit\".  It simply states the producer *had* a large number of chickens.\n\nFinally, the regex further confirmed my assessment. It searches for those moderate verbs followed by an indicator of scale, and neither of these were present.\n\nTherefore, since I don't see a moderate verb that's *directly* describing impact on the chickens, even though I see the significant scale of 2.7 million chickens, Q3 doesn't apply here.

My initial thought was to see if there was a minimiser present.  I checked for words like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely\" - but they weren't there. So, the \"A producer\" part isn't functioning as a minimizer. It's just identifying a source.\n\nNext, I looked for scale contrast. The number \"more than 2.7 million chickens\" is indeed a large number. However, the critical part is the *contrast*. There isn't any comparison to a larger total, or a smaller number, to make this seem less significant. No comparison point.\n\nThe Q6 rule demands both a minimizer and a scale contrast working in tandem.  Neither requirement is met!  \"A producer\" isn't a minimiser, and while the scale is there, it's not contrasted to downplay its impact.\n\nTherefore, this segment doesn't fit the criteria for Q6.

The language doesn't employ verbs that suggest change like \"rose,\" \"declined,\" or even more dramatic ones like \"skyrocketed\" or \"plummeted.\" There are also no risk adjectives like \"catastrophic\" or \"devastating.\"  It doesn't contain any explicit framing language that would be either alarmist or reassuring.\n\nMy instinct is this is factual reporting. The segment clearly quantifies something (\"more than 2.7 million chickens\"), and that's the decisive cue.  While the regex pattern focuses on price/rate/cost changes specifically, Q9's core principle is factual reporting of metrics without any framing.

Is it minimized? No. Is there a contrast? No, there is no frame of reference; no indication of total states or the wider context. No \"only\" or \"just\" to diminish the impact.\n*   \"a tracking page maintained by the U.S.D.A. showed.\" - A source citation, not part of the core evaluation.\n\nThe conclusion is evident: The text presents a factual statement – detection in 19 states.

It tells me the flu *was* detected in 19 states. It doesn't use any negating language. It doesn't say things like \"the flu is *not* a major concern,\" or \"*unlikely* to spread,\" or there's \"*no* risk.\" It's just a factual statement about what's been observed.\n\nSo, since there's no bare negation present, the answer to Q7 has to be \"no.\" That means the next step, according to the instructions, is to move on to Q8.

The task is to determine if the provided text snippet, \"As of March 31, the highly pathogenic form of the avian flu had been detected in 19 states, a tracking page maintained by the U.S.D.A. showed,\" fits the criteria of Q9 in the claim framing decision tree.  Q9 focuses on factual reporting of prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs.  The key is to determine if the segment presents this kind of factual, neutral reporting.\n\nFirst, I identified the core subject: the detection of avian flu in a specific number of states. This immediately points to a numerical metric – the count of affected states.  My initial thought was, \"This doesn't seem directly related to prices or economic data, so it might not be a Q9 fit.\"  However, Q9 also explicitly includes \"other numerical metrics.\"\n\nNext, I looked at the language used. The verb \"had been detected\" is undeniably a standard descriptive verb.  It's neutral and doesn't inject any framing or emotional charge. There aren't any vivid verbs like \"skyrocketed\" or risk adjectives like \"catastrophic.\" The phrase \"highly pathogenic\" is technical and factual, but I had to consider that it might be an example of alarmist framing. Since \"highly pathogenic\" is guarded, I considered that it might trigger a response indicating \"Alarmist\" or \"Reassuring\" framing.\n\nInitially, I had a hard time reconciling the \"economic data\" focus of the examples in the documentation with the non-economic nature of this segment.  The examples are all about financial metrics, so I initially assumed that Q9 was *solely* for economic contexts.\n\nHowever, after rereading the rule text of Q9, I realized the wording is broader.  It specifically mentions \"other numerical metrics,\" which means the rule can apply to things *beyond* economics. The crucial point is the *manner* of reporting: factually, using standard verbs, and *without* explicit framing.  \"19 states\" is clearly a numerical metric. \"Had been detected\" is a standard descriptive verb.  There's no vivid language, risk adjectives, or explicit framing (the phrase \"highly pathogenic\" is guarded).\n\nTherefore, this segment does fit Q9. The segment **\"detected in 19 states\"** reports a numerical metric factually using a standard verb.  That indicates a neutral frame.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"q9_result\": \"yes\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The segment reports a numerical metric factually using a standard verb: \\\"detected in 19 states\\\".\",\n  \"notes\": \"Although the examples given are focused on economics, the rule explicitly mentions 'other numerical metrics'.

It *does* imply a comparison to something larger than the past event. It hints at a larger scope when compared to 2014-2015, which does suggest scale.
