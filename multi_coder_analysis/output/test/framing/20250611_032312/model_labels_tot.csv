The user wants me to act as an expert claim-framing coder, specifically applying the first step of a 12-step decision tree. This initial step (Q1) focuses on identifying intensifiers or comparative adjectives that directly modify risk-adjectives, or the specific idiom \""deadly from the start/outset.\""  My job is to analyze each text segment, determine if it fits this pattern, and respond with a simple \""yes\"" or \""no,\"" along with a rationale.\n\nThe key here is precision. I'm looking for the *specific* pattern. It's not enough for a segment to mention risk or even death; Q1 is very targeted. For Q1, I\u2019m only looking for the specific pattern of \""intensifier/comparative + risk-adjective\"" or the fixed idiom \""deadly from the start/outset\"". Risk adjectives are specifically defined as adjectives that convey danger or severity (e.g., \""deadly,\"" \""dangerous,\"" \""severe,\"" etc.). The rule about ignoring technical terms like \""highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\"" unless further alarmist cues are present is also very important here. In other words, I'm exercising the critical thinking skills the user is looking for and the expertise the field demands. I'm not over-interpreting.\n\nI've gone through each segment carefully, evaluating each against the criteria. I've noted any instances of potential risk, but in every case, either the segment did not contain a risk-adjective at all, or the risk adjective wasn't modified by an intensifier or comparative, or the segment didn't include the specific idiom. For instance, while Segment 6 mentions \""deadly,\"" it isn't modified by an intensifier. Segment 8 features \""very low risk,\"" but \""low\"" isn't a \""risk-adjective\"" in the specific sense we're looking for, which are adjectives that convey danger or severity.

For instance, while Segment 6 mentions \""deadly,\"" it isn't modified by an intensifier.

The \""moderate verbs\"" are already defined, and the scale/impact should be explicit, think along the lines of \""millions,\"" \""record losses,\"" or something equally substantial.

The verb \""hitting\"" is on the list, but \""the market\"" doesn't quite work. The provided examples of \""scale/impact\"" are so much more specific and high-magnitude.

The \""moderate verbs\"" are already defined, and the scale/impact should be explicit, think along the lines of \""millions,\"" \""record losses,\"" or something equally substantial.

The verb \""hitting\"" is on the list, but \""the market\"" doesn't quite work. The provided examples of \""scale/impact\"" are so much more specific and high-magnitude.

These are relevant to later questions (Q4/Q5) about positive/calming/reassuring messaging, but are not relevant to the search for high-potency language.\n*   **Negative Impact:** A few segments included statements with negative outcomes, such as mentioning the killing of millions of fowl, or that another 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed.

I specifically checked these against the rules. \""Spread\"" and \""emerged\"" are considered moderate and require further analysis in later steps (Q3 in particular) to determine framing, while \""killed,\"" though a negative outcome, isn't a *vivid* verb describing the *event* itself.\n*   **Technical Terms:** The text occasionally used technical terms like \""highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\"" As the guidelines stipulate, I ignored these technical terms for the purposes of Q2.\n*   **Calming Language:** I also noted segments that used language that could be interpreted as calming (\""considered rare,\"" \""do not present an immediate public health concern,\"" \""It remains safe to eat\""). These are relevant to later questions (Q4/Q5) about positive/calming/reassuring messaging, but are not relevant to the search for high-potency language.\n*   **Negative Impact:** A few segments included statements with negative outcomes, such as mentioning the killing of millions of fowl, or that another 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed. As I have mentioned, the verbs used in those sentences did not meet the definition of high-potency verbs and would not trigger Q2. The scale of the event will likely be addressed by a different question.\n\nSince all segments result in a \""no\"" for Q2, I'll output the results as a JSON array as requested.

While 15k and 37k is a significant number of animals, the wording \""will have to be killed\"" expresses a plan or future event, not a realized impact. Additionally, *killed* is a plain outcome verb and on the excluded list, unless its paired with explicit large-scale impact. So, a \""no.\""\n\nNow comes segment 6: \""Since the outbreak began a month ago, millions of fowl have been killed, many of them in Iowa, which is the nation\u2019s leading egg producer.\"" The verbs are `began` and `have been killed`. `Began` is not on the list.  Here, `killed` is a plain outcome verb. The critical part is the phrase \""millions of fowl have been killed,\"" indicating a large-scale impact. However, based on the rules and the explicit exclusion in the regex and the cheat sheet, `killed` does *not* qualify as a Q3 verb. Though the clarification v 2.16.2 says the examples for v. 2.16.2 should be considered 'Alarmist' -- like \""millions of birds ***euthanized***\"", the core rule and regex exclude *killed* and *euthanized* from the moderate verb list. Strictly following the established guidelines means, despite the scale, this segment is also a \""no\"" for Q3.\n\nIn segment 7, \""The latest cases were at a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County,\"" I find no qualifying verbs.

I specifically checked these against the rules. \""Spread\"" and \""emerged\"" are considered moderate and require further analysis in later steps (Q3 in particular) to determine framing, while \""killed,\"" though a negative outcome, isn't a *vivid* verb describing the *event* itself.\n*   **Technical Terms:** The text occasionally used technical terms like \""highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\"" As the guidelines stipulate, I ignored these technical terms for the purposes of Q2.\n*   **Calming Language:** I also noted segments that used language that could be interpreted as calming (\""considered rare,\"" \""do not present an immediate public health concern,\"" \""It remains safe to eat\""). These are relevant to later questions (Q4/Q5) about positive/calming/reassuring messaging, but are not relevant to the search for high-potency language.\n*   **Negative Impact:** A few segments included statements with negative outcomes, such as mentioning the killing of millions of fowl, or that another 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed. As I have mentioned, the verbs used in those sentences did not meet the definition of high-potency verbs and would not trigger Q2.

I've been tasked to analyze these segments for reassurance techniques, specifically looking for the \""Minimizer + Scale Contrast\"" pattern in Q6.  My focus is on whether a segment uses minimizer words (like \""only,\"" \""just,\"" \""merely\"") *alongside* an explicit scale contrast to downplay significance. I have processed each segment step-by-step, meticulously looking for that specific combination.\n\nEssentially, I'm checking if the segment attempts to minimize a potentially alarming situation by saying something like \""only a few cases out of millions\"".\n\nHere's my thought process for each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:**  No dice. While the segment uses \""rare,\"" that's just a general adjective; there are no minimizers or scale contrasts present. Thus, no Q6 pattern.\n*   **Segment 2:** This is a negative statement about Americans contracting viruses, but doesn't fit Q6. This might be a Q7 (Bare Negation). Q6 pattern missing.\n*   **Segment 3:**  Just historical information about the emergence and spread of the virus. Doesn't contain our pattern. No Q6 elements.\n*   **Segment 4:**  Numbers of animals killed on specific farms, no attempts at downplaying it using minimizers and scales. Again, the Q6 pattern is absent.\n*   **Segment 5:**  Mentions \""millions of fowl\"" and \""nation's leading egg producer,\"" but no minimizer modifies those scales. Nothing that fits the Q6 criteria.\n*   **Segment 6:**  Just reporting locations of the cases; not using minimizers and/or scales together. Doesn't fit Q6.\n*   **Segment 7:**  States no immediate health concern, falling under Q5 (Explicit Calming). Not a Q6 case.\n\nSo, after a thorough analysis, it's clear: none of these segments contain the specific Q6 pattern. Therefore, for *every* segment, the answer is \""no\"".

I carefully analyzed each segment for intensifiers or comparatives modifying known risk-adjectives. I also checked for the specified idiom. I used my expertise to differentiate between risk-adjectives and related terms like \""rare\"" or technical descriptions, which I recognized as potentially indicative of later steps in the decision tree (e.g., Q4/Q5). I excluded technical terms unless other alarmist cues were present.

My goal is to identify and flag any alarmist framing using that specific criterion.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing each segment against the provided rules and the regex pattern, I've concluded that *none* of them meet the criteria for a \""yes\"" answer in Q2. Let's go through the rationale for each:\n\n*   **Segments 1-9:** In each case, I didn't identify any high-potency verbs or metaphors that would trigger an \""Alarmist\"" frame. I looked for cues like \""ravaged,\"" \""slaughtered,\"" or similar vivid language, but none were present. Some segments touched on negative outcomes or scale, but those are concerns for other questions in the process (like Q3 regarding scale and impact or Q5 for negations and capability statements).\n*   **Verb Strength:** In several segments, verbs like \""spread,\"" \""killed,\"" or \""emerged\"" appeared. I specifically checked these against the rules. \""Spread\"" and \""emerged\"" are considered moderate and require further analysis in later steps (Q3 in particular) to determine framing, while \""killed,\"" though a negative outcome, isn't a *vivid* verb describing the *event* itself.\n*   **Technical Terms:** The text occasionally used technical terms like \""highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\"" As the guidelines stipulate, I ignored these technical terms for the purposes of Q2.\n*   **Calming Language:** I also noted segments that used language that could be interpreted as calming (\""considered rare,\"" \""do not present an immediate public health concern,\"" \""It remains safe to eat\""). These are relevant to later questions (Q4/Q5) about positive/calming/reassuring messaging, but are not relevant to the search for high-potency language.\n*   **Negative Impact:** A few segments included statements with negative outcomes, such as mentioning the killing of millions of fowl, or that another 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed. As I have mentioned, the verbs used in those sentences did not meet the definition of high-potency verbs and would not trigger Q2. The scale of the event will likely be addressed by a different question.\n\nSince all segments result in a \""no\"" for Q2, I'll output the results as a JSON array as requested. I'm satisfied that I've applied the Q2 rules accurately and consistently across all text segments.\n""}, {""Q"": 3, ""answer"": ""no"", ""rationale"": ""Segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with scale/impact."", ""thoughts"": ""**Analysis of Text Segments for Q3 Application**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with applying the Q3 criteria from the decision tree to a series of text segments. My task is to identify instances where \""moderate verbs\"" are paired with \""significant scale or impact,\"" specifically denoting realized impact and not plans or hypotheticals.\n\nI've got a list of \""moderate verbs\"" \u2013 `hit`, `swept`, `surged`, `soared`, `plunged`, `plummeted`, `prompted`, `feared`, `fearing`, and `were/was culled` \u2013 and I'm looking for these alongside explicit indicators of scale like \""millions,\"" \""record losses,\"" or \""overwhelming.\""  I know that simple verbs like `killed`, `died`, `affected`, `reported`, `euthanized`, and `depopulated` are excluded unless they're explicitly paired with large-scale figures.\n\nI started with segment 1: \""Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\""  It's a clear \""no\"" for Q3. There are no moderate verbs and no indication of scale.\n\nSegment 2, \""Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said,\"" is also a no-go. No moderate verbs, no impact.\n\nSegment 3: \""No Americans are recorded to have contracted highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\""  Again, no moderate verbs or significant scale, so no Q3.\n\nIn segment 4, \""The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world,\"" the verbs are `emerged`, `leading`, and `spread`.

Another \""no.\""\n\nSegment 5 states, \""Another 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed after bird flu spread to two more Iowa farms, state agriculture officials announced Sunday.\"" The verbs here are `killed` and `spread`.  `Spread` is not a Q3 verb. While 15k and 37k is a significant number of animals, the wording \""will have to be killed\"" expresses a plan or future event, not a realized impact. Additionally, *killed* is a plain outcome verb and on the excluded list, unless its paired with explicit large-scale impact. So, a \""no.\""\n\nNow comes segment 6: \""Since the outbreak began a month ago, millions of fowl have been killed, many of them in Iowa, which is the nation\u2019s leading egg producer.\"" The verbs are `began` and `have been killed`. `Began` is not on the list.  Here, `killed` is a plain outcome verb. The critical part is the phrase \""millions of fowl have been killed,\"" indicating a large-scale impact. However, based on the rules and the explicit exclusion in the regex and the cheat sheet, `killed` does *not* qualify as a Q3 verb. Though the clarification v 2.16.2 says the examples for v. 2.16.2 should be considered 'Alarmist' -- like \""millions of birds ***euthanized***\"", the core rule and regex exclude *killed* and *euthanized* from the moderate verb list. Strictly following the established guidelines means, despite the scale, this segment is also a \""no\"" for Q3.\n\nIn segment 7, \""The latest cases were at a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County,\"" I find no qualifying verbs. A \""no.\""\n\nSegment 8 says, \""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the cases in birds do not present an immediate public health concern.\"" Again, no qualifying verbs, so it's a \""no\"" for Q3.\n\nFinally, segment 9: \""No human cases of the avian influenza virus have been detected in the United States.
