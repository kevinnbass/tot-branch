{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' modifies the risk-adjective 'infectious'.", "thoughts": "**My Q1 Evaluation Process**\n\nMy task was to act as an expert claim-framing coder, focusing solely on the first step of a 12-step decision tree (Q1). My primary goal was to identify whether each text segment contained an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective, or if it included the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\" If a segment met this criteria, I would immediately classify it as \"Alarmist\" and move to the next segment.\n\nI meticulously reviewed each segment, applying my knowledge of linguistic patterns. I carefully analyzed each segment for intensifiers or comparatives modifying known risk-adjectives. I also checked for the specified idiom. I used my expertise to differentiate between risk-adjectives and related terms like \"rare\" or technical descriptions, which I recognized as potentially indicative of later steps in the decision tree (e.g., Q4/Q5). I excluded technical terms unless other alarmist cues were present. I made sure to flag and clarify my rationales for each decision.\n\nI successfully evaluated all ten segments based on the Q1 criteria. I recognized the first matching segment at Segment 8. I will now compile my responses into the required JSON format.\n"}
