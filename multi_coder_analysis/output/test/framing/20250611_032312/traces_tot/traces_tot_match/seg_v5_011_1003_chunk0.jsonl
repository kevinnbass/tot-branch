{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segments for Alarmist Framing (Q1)**\n\nOkay, here's how I approached this. My task was to act as an expert claim-framing coder, specifically focusing on the initial question (Q1) within a 12-step decision tree. I needed to identify if each text segment contained an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a \"risk adjective.\" The prompt stressed that I could *only* use the provided rules and examples, which I took very seriously.\n\nFirst, I established my framework.  I knew the \"risk adjectives\" I should look for: *deadly, lethal, dangerous, severe, catastrophic, brutal, contagious, virulent, destructive*. I also had the list of intensifiers and comparatives: *so, very, extremely, highly (unless part of HPAI), severely, particularly, frighteningly, more, less, deadlier, safer, higher, lower*.\n\nI then meticulously examined each segment.  For each, I was looking for that specific pattern:  an intensifier/comparative *directly* modifying one of the risk adjectives.  I diligently applied the Bedrock Principle and the Symmetry Rule throughout.\n\n*   **Segment 1:** Focused on disease and culling, but no intensifiers/comparatives modifying risk adjectives. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 2:** Discussed public health concern but negated it. No Q1 pattern. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 3:**  Talked about virus spread. \"Spreading\" is a verb, not an adjective. No Q1 pattern. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 4 & 9:** Production and export statistics. No risk adjectives, no intensifiers. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 5 & 10:** Production ranking. Again, no risk adjectives or intensifiers. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 6:** Discusses industry and feed grains. No Q1 elements. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 7:** Market impacts, demand, labor issues. No risk adjectives modified. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 8:** Supply statistics. No Q1 match. \"No.\"\n\nIn all cases, after careful analysis based on the precise prompt requirements, I determined that Q1 was not triggered. Thus, I concluded that none of the text segments presented an \"Alarmist\" frame based *solely* on the first question of the decision tree. I am now prepared to output the JSON array with the \"no\" answers and relevant rationales.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verbs 'detected' and 'culled' are not high-potency verbs or metaphors.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text for Alarmist Framing: Q2 - High-Potency Verbs/Metaphors**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. My task is to go through each text segment and determine if it triggers the \"Alarmist\" frame based on the presence of high-potency verbs or metaphors, according to a 12-step decision tree. I'm currently at Step Q2, which focuses on identifying these alarmist linguistic cues.\n\nFor each segment, I'm checking for verbs or metaphors that convey a strong sense of threat or urgency, as defined in the provided criteria and regular expression pattern. If I find a match, I'll flag it as \"yes\" and explain my rationale, quoting the specific cue. If not, I'll answer \"no\" and provide a brief explanation.  Importantly, while the alarmist frame *would* be triggered, I am only providing a *Q2* response at this point.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** No high-potency verbs or metaphors here. \"Detected\" and \"culled\" are factual, not alarmist. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 2:** The verb \"present\" is not high-potency. It's a low-risk statement. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 3:** \"Spreading\" is a moderate verb. \"Tested positive\" is factual. Neither meets the Q2 criteria. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 4:** This segment is purely factual about market position. No alarmist language. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 5:** Similar to Segment 4, this is a factual statement. No high-potency verbs. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 6:** Again, factual information. No alarmist language. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 7:** I see the verb \"hitting.\" However, while it is followed by a discussion of impacts, the *boundary guard* explicitly specifies that \"hit\" is Neutral unless a concrete magnitude is given. Here, we *don't* have a number or adjective in this segment to signal magnitude, even though those appear in the *next* segment. So, no alarmist cues here. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 8:** The phrase \"were down\" indicates *state* not *active impact*. The numbers that follow are *magnitude* but do not directly apply to the verb. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 9:** This is a duplicate of Segment 4. No high-potency verbs or metaphors. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 10:** Duplicate of Segment 5. No high-potency verbs or metaphors. **Answer: no.**\n\nAll segments passed Q2. I'm ready to output the JSON array, with the segment ID, \"no\", and the rationale.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "Contains 'culled' but paired only with 'a backyard flock', not significant scale/impact.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segments Against Q3**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of how I'd approach these text segments, focusing on applying Q3 and why they fail to meet the criteria.\n\nMy starting point is a clear understanding of what Q3 is looking for: \"moderate verbs\" that denote *realized* impact, coupled with *significant* scale or impact. The \"moderate verbs\" are already defined, and the scale/impact should be explicit, think along the lines of \"millions,\" \"record losses,\" or something equally substantial. Notably, the impact has to be *realized*, not planned or hypothetical.\n\nLet's dive into each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** The phrase \"have already been culled\" uses the verb \"culled,\" which is on the moderate verb list, specifically because of the regular expression `(were|was)\\s+culled`. This looks promising. However, the scale \"a backyard flock\" is where this falls apart. A backyard flock, while potentially a financial loss to the owner, does not meet the criteria for *significant* scale/impact. Q3 requires more substantial figures to trigger a \"yes.\"\n\n*   **Segment 2, 3:** No moderate verbs from my list are present, so a quick \"no\" for these two.\n\n*   **Segments 4, 5, 6, 9, 10:** These segments all mention scale (\"world's largest,\" \"second-largest,\" \"seventh biggest\"), but they lack the necessary \"moderate verb\" to describe a *realized* impact. They're describing context, not the direct impact of the event.\n\n*   **Segment 7:** \"The disease is hitting the market\". The verb \"hitting\" is on the list, but \"the market\" doesn't quite work. The provided examples of \"scale/impact\" are so much more specific and high-magnitude. The other factors in the sentence are descriptive to the backdrop, not indicative of *Q3 magnitude*. That makes this a \"no,\" too.\n\n*   **Segment 8:** Mentions \"down 14 percent\" and \"down 23 percent.\" This represents a decrease, but it doesn't describe the realized impact of any moderate verb, like a \"plunged\" or \"plummeted.\" The impact is inferred, not explicit.\n\nTherefore, after a careful consideration of all segments based on the explicit criteria laid out by Q3, I must determine that all segments fail to meet the requirements to classify the criteria as \"yes\".\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Loaded Rhetorical Questions (Q4: Alarm)**\n\nMy task was to act as an expert claim-framing coder, assessing ten text segments against the fourth step of a 12-step decision tree. Specifically, I needed to determine if each segment contained a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm. My response required a JSON array with segment IDs, answers (yes/no/uncertain), and rationales. If a \"yes\" answer were found, I would have stopped there.\n\nFor each segment, I carefully reviewed the language, focusing on whether it employed rhetorical questions with an underlying goal of instilling alarm. After meticulous analysis, I concluded that none of the provided segments contained such questions.\n\nTherefore, for each segment, the answer to Q4 (\"Does this segment contain a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm?\") is unequivocally \"no.\" The rationale for each \"no\" response is that the segment does not contain a rhetorical question of that nature, instead primarily using factual statements, statistics, or direct reporting of events.\n"}

I'm acting as a claim-framing expert, strictly adhering to the specified rules (Bedrock Principle, Symmetry Rule, Context Guard, Precedence Ladder, Mandatory Step-by-Step Decision Process), and completing the requested Q5 analysis. My task is to evaluate each text segment for explicit calming cues used for reassurance, such as \"no cause for alarm\" or \"rest assured.\" I'm also going to be sure to quote the cue if I find one.  Let's get into it.\n\n**Segment-by-Segment Breakdown**\n\n*   **Segments 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10:**  After carefully reviewing all of the provided text segments against the Q5 rule, I have determined that none of them contain any explicit calming cues that would indicate reassurance. The segments either report facts (detection, source, economic data) or background information about the situation. No statements like \"no cause for alarm\" or the like appear in these segments.\n\n*   **Segment 2:** This was a bit tricky. The phrase \"do not present an immediate public health concern\" initially might sound reassuring. However, in this 12-step decision tree, such bare negations are categorized as Q7 material. This particular phrase is evaluated at that level.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe explicit calming cue criterion from Q5 was not met in any of the provided segments.

My expertise in framing allows me to efficiently identify the presence or absence of a specific rhetorical strategy: the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" used for reassurance.\n\nMy understanding is this: I need to look for two things *working together*: a minimiser token (like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few\") and an explicit scale contrast (\"out of,\" \"among,\" \"nationwide,\" etc.).  Both need to be present and functioning to downplay the significance of something. Just a minimiser or just a scale isn't enough; they have to *work together*. Bare numerals alone don't count as minimisers unless they are preceded by an actual minimiser token.\n\nI went through each of the provided segments. In *none* of them did I find both of these elements working together as described. Therefore, the answer for each segment is \"no\".\n\nHere's the detailed breakdown, segment by segment. I'm noting the absence of the key criteria as my rationale:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" - No minimiser token or explicit scale contrast is present.\n*   **Segment 2:** \"There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses, but worldwide, 864 people have contracted it...since 2003, resulting in 456 deaths, according to the CDC and WHO.\" - No minimiser token is applied to the numbers, despite \"worldwide\" providing context.\n*   **Segment 3:** \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys...\" - No minimiser token is present.\n*   **Segment 4:** \"Polish veterinary authorities...were planning to cull tens of thousands of birds...\" - No minimiser token is present.\n*   **Segment 5:** \"Police were blocking access to the affected area to non-residents.\" - No minimiser token or explicit scale contrast is present.\n*   **Segment 6:** \"...confirmed that the deadly H5N8 virus was responsible for the turkey deaths in two farms in the village of Stary Uscimow...\" - No minimiser token preceding \"two.\"\n*   **Segment 7:** \"In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact...\" - No minimiser token or explicit scale contrast is present.\n*   **Segment 8:** \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk...but it has the potential of being deadly...\" - No minimiser token or explicit scale contrast is present.\n*   **Segment 9:** \"...the bird flu strain currently circulating in the U.S. is H5N1, and is related to the 2015 avian virus that killed 50 million birds across 15 states...\" - No minimiser token preceding \"50 million.\"\n*   **Segment 10:** \"The disease was also detected in a backyard flock of birds in Fauquier County, Virginia...\" - No minimiser token or explicit scale contrast is present.\n\nSince the criteria for Q6 were *not* met by any of the segments, my conclusion is that we proceed to the next question in the decision tree (Q7).\n"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a bare negation as defined by Q7.", "thoughts": "**Applying Q7: Bare Negations in Text Segments**\n\nAlright, I've got the task.  I need to go through these 10 text segments, carefully looking for \"bare negations\" – that is, negative statements without any accompanying calming language.  The goal is to determine if the presence of such a negation warrants a \"Yes\" answer to Q7, which indicates a \"Neutral\" frame.\n\nHere's how I approached each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** No bare negation. \"Rare\" isn't a negation in the context we're looking for.  So, \"no\" to Q7.\n*   **Segment 2:** This one *does* have a bare negation: \"no record of Americans contracting\". That fits the \"Evidence Negations\" pattern.  No calming cues are present. Therefore, \"yes\" to Q7. The rationale is the quote itself: \"no record of Americans contracting\".\n*   **Segment 3:** No bare negation here. It's just a factual statement about deaths. So, \"no\" to Q7.\n*   **Segment 4:** This segment is also just a factual description of an action. No bare negation. \"No\" to Q7.\n*   **Segment 5:** Again, purely factual. \"No\" to Q7.\n*   **Segment 6:**  I found a bare negation: \"It was not clear how... found its way\". That falls under the \"Expectation Negations\" pattern, or at least a lack of clear knowledge. No calming cues. So, \"yes\" to Q7. The rationale is the quote: \"It was not clear how\".\n*   **Segment 7:** I considered \"prevent contact\" but ultimately, I concluded it's an *instruction*, not a *denial* of capability as defined by the rule.  So, \"no\" to Q7.\n*   **Segment 8:** Bingo! \"does not present a food safety risk\". This is a direct hit to the \"Risk Negations\" pattern, closely aligned with \"doesn't pose a risk\" and the specific regex.  No calming cue. So, \"yes\" to Q7. The rationale is, of course: \"does not present a food safety risk\".\n*   **Segment 9:** Just factual information. \"No\" to Q7.\n*   **Segment 10:** Purely factual. \"No\" to Q7.\n\nSo, the segments with a \"yes\" answer to Q7 are:\n\n*   Segment 2\n*   Segment 6\n*   Segment 8\n\nAll other segments get a \"no\".

It's a straightforward fact, not a description of capabilities or safeguards. No.\n\n*   **Segment 3:** \"Planning to cull\" clearly describes a response measure. The key here is the *absence* of reassurance. This is a \"yes\" for Q8.\n\n*   **Segment 4:** \"Blocking access\" is another action being taken, a response. Again, no reassurance language. \"Yes\" for Q8.\n\n*   **Segment 5:** \"Practicing good biosecurity,\" \"prevent contact,\" and \"report sick birds\" all describe recommended actions, essentially preparedness. These are preparedness statements, so \"yes\" on Q8.\n\n*   **Segment 6:** This discusses the history of a strain. Straight factual reporting. No.\n\n*   **Segment 7:** \"Have already been culled\" describes an action taken.
