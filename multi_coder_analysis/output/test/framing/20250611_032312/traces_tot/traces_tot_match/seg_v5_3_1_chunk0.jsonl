{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective, nor the 'deadly from the start' idiom.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: Intensifiers/Comparatives with Risk-Adjectives or \"Deadly from the Start\"**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. The user wants me to act as an expert claim-framing coder, specifically applying the first step of a 12-step decision tree. This initial step (Q1) focuses on identifying intensifiers or comparative adjectives that directly modify risk-adjectives, or the specific idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\"  My job is to analyze each text segment, determine if it fits this pattern, and respond with a simple \"yes\" or \"no,\" along with a rationale.\n\nThe key here is precision. I'm looking for the *specific* pattern. It's not enough for a segment to mention risk or even death; Q1 is very targeted. For Q1, I’m only looking for the specific pattern of \"intensifier/comparative + risk-adjective\" or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\". Risk adjectives are specifically defined as adjectives that convey danger or severity (e.g., \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" etc.). The rule about ignoring technical terms like \"highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\" unless further alarmist cues are present is also very important here. In other words, I'm exercising the critical thinking skills the user is looking for and the expertise the field demands. I'm not over-interpreting.\n\nI've gone through each segment carefully, evaluating each against the criteria. I've noted any instances of potential risk, but in every case, either the segment did not contain a risk-adjective at all, or the risk adjective wasn't modified by an intensifier or comparative, or the segment didn't include the specific idiom. For instance, while Segment 6 mentions \"deadly,\" it isn't modified by an intensifier. Segment 8 features \"very low risk,\" but \"low\" isn't a \"risk-adjective\" in the specific sense we're looking for, which are adjectives that convey danger or severity. These considerations have led me to respond with a \"no\" for all cases. The final JSON array will reflect this consistent negative result.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses moderate language ('were blocking access', 'affected area') without high-potency verbs or metaphors.", "thoughts": "**Applying the Q2 Rule: An Expert's Perspective**\n\nAs an expert coder in claim-framing, I've just completed a meticulous analysis of ten text segments, applying the Q2 rule to identify potential alarmist framing. My task was to scrutinize each segment for the presence of high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert\" (along with a nearby threat word).\n\nThroughout the process, I adhered rigorously to the provided definitions, rules, and regex pattern. The Bedrock Principle and Symmetry Rule guided my judgment, focusing on the presentation rather than the factual accuracy of the information. Each segment was evaluated independently, and in no instances were the key alarmist cues identified.\n\nWhile some segments contained strong verbs or described negative impacts, such as \"threatens to spark\" or \"killed,\" these did not meet the specific criteria outlined in the Q2 rule and the regex pattern. My expertise allowed me to distinguish between factual descriptions and the vivid language required to trigger an \"Alarmist\" frame. In all cases, I determined that the answer to Q2 was \"no.\" I am confident in this conclusion, having taken extreme care in evaluating each segment and applying my specific coding expertise to the nuanced linguistic criteria for alarmism. I will move on to the next phase as instructed.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'affected' is a plain outcome verb and not in the moderate verb list for this rule.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Moderate Verbs and Impact**\n\nOkay, I've received the instructions for this Q3 analysis, and I'm ready to proceed. My task is to go through each text segment and determine if it meets the criteria: does it contain a \"moderate verb\" (from the approved list) *and* is that verb explicitly paired with information detailing significant scale or impact? I've been given a clear list of verbs to look for (`hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|(?:were|was)\\s+culled`) and I understand that realized impact is key, not plans or hypotheticals.\n\nHere's my analysis of each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** No qualifying verbs, so a simple \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 2:** While there are numbers here, the verbs aren't from the moderate list. The answer is \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 3:** \"Responsible for deaths\" is not a \"moderate verb,\" and \"deaths\" is a plain outcome noun. Therefore, \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 4:** This is a plan (\"planning to cull\"), not a realized impact, so \"no.\" The regex and rules clearly outline this.\n*   **Segment 5:** \"Affected\" is a plain verb, not a moderate verb, so another \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 6:** Again, the verb is \"responsible for,\" which doesn't qualify. The answer is \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 7:** No moderate verbs or any relevant scale information. The answer is \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 8:** \"Risk... is very low\" is calming language, not an example of the target rule. The answer is \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 9:** \"Threatens to spark\" and \"soaring\" are also not a match. Neither \"threatens\" nor \"spark\" are in the approved regex list, and the \"soaring inflation\" is background condition per rules. Therefore, \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 10:** While \"killed 50 million birds\" shows scale, \"killed\" is explicitly excluded. The rule is very specific on this and therefore the answer is \"no.\"\n\nIt seems, based on this review of the segments, I'm returning \"no\" for all cases, as none of the segments fulfill both conditions (moderate verb and impact).\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no loaded rhetorical question.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of Rhetorical Alarm in Text Segments**\n\nI've been tasked with analyzing ten text segments to identify any instances of loaded rhetorical questions designed to induce alarm, specifically focusing on the \"Q4: Loaded Rhetorical Question for Alarm\" step of the 12-step decision tree. My goal is to determine, for each segment, whether it contains such a question and, if so, to provide a \"yes\" answer and a rationale citing the specific cue. If no, then I must provide a \"no\" answer, along with an appropriate rationale.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing each segment, I've concluded that *none* of them contain loaded rhetorical questions designed to imply alarm. Segment 1 provides a straightforward factual statement on risk. Segment 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 provide statistics, reports of events or actions taken, or statements about the situation and related information. Segment 7 provides biosecurity advice, and Segment 8 states that the risk to humans is low, as well as describing safety measures. Segment 9 outlines risks and potential impacts.\n\nGiven these findings, my output will be a JSON array where each entry represents a segment with a \"no\" answer. The rationale for each \"no\" will state that no loaded rhetorical question implying alarm was found.\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports an action being taken, neutrally, without explicit calming cues.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segments Against Q5: Explicit Calming Cue for Reassurance**\n\nMy task was to act as a claim-framing expert, analyzing text segments for the presence of explicit calming cues, following the specified rules and guidelines. Specifically, I focused on Q5, which assesses segments for explicit calming cues for reassurance.  I adhered to the Bedrock Principle (code the presentation, not the facts) and the Symmetry Rule throughout this analysis, paying close attention to the provided Q5 Pattern Recognition Table and relevant examples. I was also mindful of the self-audit checklist.\n\nHere's my breakdown, presented as a JSON array as requested:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_11_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No explicit calming cues found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_12_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No explicit calming cues found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_1_1_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No explicit calming cues found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_2_1_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No explicit calming cues found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_3_1_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No explicit calming cues found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_4_1_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No explicit calming cues found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_11_1004_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No explicit calming cues found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_12_1004_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Contains an intensified low-risk evaluation: \\\"risk... is very low\\\".\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_13_1004_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No explicit calming cues found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_14_1004_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No explicit calming cues found.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nIn summary, out of the ten segments evaluated, only one (segment ID `seg_v5_12_1004_chunk0`) triggered a \"yes\" response for Q5.  This was due to the presence of the phrase \"risk... is very low\", meeting the criteria for an intensified low-risk evaluation, which classifies it as Reassuring. All other segments failed to meet any of the Q5 criteria.\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes an action ('blocking access') and contains no minimiser or scale contrast.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment: Reassurance - Minimiser + Scale Contrast (Q6)**\n\nOkay, here's what I've determined after carefully analyzing each text segment against the Q6 criteria. My expertise in framing allows me to efficiently identify the presence or absence of a specific rhetorical strategy: the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" used for reassurance.\n\nMy understanding is this: I need to look for two things *working together*: a minimiser token (like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few\") and an explicit scale contrast (\"out of,\" \"among,\" \"nationwide,\" etc.).  Both need to be present and functioning to downplay the significance of something. Just a minimiser or just a scale isn't enough; they have to *work together*. Bare numerals alone don't count as minimisers unless they are preceded by an actual minimiser token.\n\nI went through each of the provided segments. In *none* of them did I find both of these elements working together as described. Therefore, the answer for each segment is \"no\".\n\nHere's the detailed breakdown, segment by segment. I'm noting the absence of the key criteria as my rationale:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" - No minimiser token or explicit scale contrast is present.\n*   **Segment 2:** \"There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses, but worldwide, 864 people have contracted it...since 2003, resulting in 456 deaths, according to the CDC and WHO.\" - No minimiser token is applied to the numbers, despite \"worldwide\" providing context.\n*   **Segment 3:** \"Authorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys...\" - No minimiser token is present.\n*   **Segment 4:** \"Polish veterinary authorities...were planning to cull tens of thousands of birds...\" - No minimiser token is present.\n*   **Segment 5:** \"Police were blocking access to the affected area to non-residents.\" - No minimiser token or explicit scale contrast is present.\n*   **Segment 6:** \"...confirmed that the deadly H5N8 virus was responsible for the turkey deaths in two farms in the village of Stary Uscimow...\" - No minimiser token preceding \"two.\"\n*   **Segment 7:** \"In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact...\" - No minimiser token or explicit scale contrast is present.\n*   **Segment 8:** \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk...but it has the potential of being deadly...\" - No minimiser token or explicit scale contrast is present.\n*   **Segment 9:** \"...the bird flu strain currently circulating in the U.S. is H5N1, and is related to the 2015 avian virus that killed 50 million birds across 15 states...\" - No minimiser token preceding \"50 million.\"\n*   **Segment 10:** \"The disease was also detected in a backyard flock of birds in Fauquier County, Virginia...\" - No minimiser token or explicit scale contrast is present.\n\nSince the criteria for Q6 were *not* met by any of the segments, my conclusion is that we proceed to the next question in the decision tree (Q7).\n"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a bare negation as defined by Q7.", "thoughts": "**Applying Q7: Bare Negations in Text Segments**\n\nAlright, I've got the task.  I need to go through these 10 text segments, carefully looking for \"bare negations\" – that is, negative statements without any accompanying calming language.  The goal is to determine if the presence of such a negation warrants a \"Yes\" answer to Q7, which indicates a \"Neutral\" frame.\n\nHere's how I approached each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** No bare negation. \"Rare\" isn't a negation in the context we're looking for.  So, \"no\" to Q7.\n*   **Segment 2:** This one *does* have a bare negation: \"no record of Americans contracting\". That fits the \"Evidence Negations\" pattern.  No calming cues are present. Therefore, \"yes\" to Q7. The rationale is the quote itself: \"no record of Americans contracting\".\n*   **Segment 3:** No bare negation here. It's just a factual statement about deaths. So, \"no\" to Q7.\n*   **Segment 4:** This segment is also just a factual description of an action. No bare negation. \"No\" to Q7.\n*   **Segment 5:** Again, purely factual. \"No\" to Q7.\n*   **Segment 6:**  I found a bare negation: \"It was not clear how... found its way\". That falls under the \"Expectation Negations\" pattern, or at least a lack of clear knowledge. No calming cues. So, \"yes\" to Q7. The rationale is the quote: \"It was not clear how\".\n*   **Segment 7:** I considered \"prevent contact\" but ultimately, I concluded it's an *instruction*, not a *denial* of capability as defined by the rule.  So, \"no\" to Q7.\n*   **Segment 8:** Bingo! \"does not present a food safety risk\". This is a direct hit to the \"Risk Negations\" pattern, closely aligned with \"doesn't pose a risk\" and the specific regex.  No calming cue. So, \"yes\" to Q7. The rationale is, of course: \"does not present a food safety risk\".\n*   **Segment 9:** Just factual information. \"No\" to Q7.\n*   **Segment 10:** Purely factual. \"No\" to Q7.\n\nSo, the segments with a \"yes\" answer to Q7 are:\n\n*   Segment 2\n*   Segment 6\n*   Segment 8\n\nAll other segments get a \"no\".

My goal is to determine whether each segment describes capabilities, preparedness measures, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards without explicitly linking them to current calm, safety, or minimized risk. If the answer is \"yes,\" I'll label the segment as \"Neutral.\" If \"no,\" I'll move on to the next question (which isn't provided here, but I understand the process).\n\nHere's my evaluation, segment by segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** This is straightforwardly a statement about risk. No, Q8 doesn't apply. It's a simple risk description.\n\n*   **Segment 2:** This segment reports on a negative event (deaths). It's a straightforward fact, not a description of capabilities or safeguards. No.\n\n*   **Segment 3:** \"Planning to cull\" clearly describes a response measure.

Again, no reassurance language. \"Yes\" for Q8.\n\n*   **Segment 5:** \"Practicing good biosecurity,\" \"prevent contact,\" and \"report sick birds\" all describe recommended actions, essentially preparedness.
