{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'highly pathogenic' is a technical term and does not trigger Q1.", "thoughts": "**My Q1 Evaluation Process**\n\nMy task was to act as an expert claim-framing coder, focusing solely on the first step of a 12-step decision tree (Q1). My primary goal was to identify whether each text segment contained an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective, or if it included the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\" If a segment met this criteria, I would immediately classify it as \"Alarmist\" and move to the next segment.\n\nI meticulously reviewed each segment, applying my knowledge of linguistic patterns. I carefully analyzed each segment for intensifiers or comparatives modifying known risk-adjectives. I also checked for the specified idiom. I used my expertise to differentiate between risk-adjectives and related terms like \"rare\" or technical descriptions, which I recognized as potentially indicative of later steps in the decision tree (e.g., Q4/Q5). I excluded technical terms unless other alarmist cues were present. I made sure to flag and clarify my rationales for each decision.\n\nI successfully evaluated all ten segments based on the Q1 criteria. I recognized the first matching segment at Segment 8. I will now compile my responses into the required JSON format.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states no Americans have 'contracted' the virus, using factual language without high-potency verbs or metaphors. 'highly pathogenic' is a technical term.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text for Alarmist Language (Q2)**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of these text segments, focusing specifically on Question 2 of the decision tree: do they contain high-potency verbs or potent metaphors? My goal is to identify and flag any alarmist framing using that specific criterion.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing each segment against the provided rules and the regex pattern, I've concluded that *none* of them meet the criteria for a \"yes\" answer in Q2. Let's go through the rationale for each:\n\n*   **Segments 1-9:** In each case, I didn't identify any high-potency verbs or metaphors that would trigger an \"Alarmist\" frame. I looked for cues like \"ravaged,\" \"slaughtered,\" or similar vivid language, but none were present. Some segments touched on negative outcomes or scale, but those are concerns for other questions in the process (like Q3 regarding scale and impact or Q5 for negations and capability statements).\n*   **Verb Strength:** In several segments, verbs like \"spread,\" \"killed,\" or \"emerged\" appeared. I specifically checked these against the rules. \"Spread\" and \"emerged\" are considered moderate and require further analysis in later steps (Q3 in particular) to determine framing, while \"killed,\" though a negative outcome, isn't a *vivid* verb describing the *event* itself.\n*   **Technical Terms:** The text occasionally used technical terms like \"highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\" As the guidelines stipulate, I ignored these technical terms for the purposes of Q2.\n*   **Calming Language:** I also noted segments that used language that could be interpreted as calming (\"considered rare,\" \"do not present an immediate public health concern,\" \"It remains safe to eat\"). These are relevant to later questions (Q4/Q5) about positive/calming/reassuring messaging, but are not relevant to the search for high-potency language.\n*   **Negative Impact:** A few segments included statements with negative outcomes, such as mentioning the killing of millions of fowl, or that another 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed. As I have mentioned, the verbs used in those sentences did not meet the definition of high-potency verbs and would not trigger Q2. The scale of the event will likely be addressed by a different question.\n\nSince all segments result in a \"no\" for Q2, I'll output the results as a JSON array as requested. I'm satisfied that I've applied the Q2 rules accurately and consistently across all text segments.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "Segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with scale/impact.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segments for Q3 Application**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with applying the Q3 criteria from the decision tree to a series of text segments. My task is to identify instances where \"moderate verbs\" are paired with \"significant scale or impact,\" specifically denoting realized impact and not plans or hypotheticals.\n\nI've got a list of \"moderate verbs\" – `hit`, `swept`, `surged`, `soared`, `plunged`, `plummeted`, `prompted`, `feared`, `fearing`, and `were/was culled` – and I'm looking for these alongside explicit indicators of scale like \"millions,\" \"record losses,\" or \"overwhelming.\"  I know that simple verbs like `killed`, `died`, `affected`, `reported`, `euthanized`, and `depopulated` are excluded unless they're explicitly paired with large-scale figures.\n\nI started with segment 1: \"Almost 18 percent of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains.\"  It's a clear \"no\" for Q3. There are no moderate verbs and no indication of scale.\n\nSegment 2, \"Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said,\" is also a no-go. No moderate verbs, no impact.\n\nSegment 3: \"No Americans are recorded to have contracted highly pathogenic avian flu viruses.\"  Again, no moderate verbs or significant scale, so no Q3.\n\nIn segment 4, \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world,\" the verbs are `emerged`, `leading`, and `spread`. While it discusses outbreaks, none of these verbs are on the moderate verb list. Another \"no.\"\n\nSegment 5 states, \"Another 15,000 chickens and 37,000 turkeys will have to be killed after bird flu spread to two more Iowa farms, state agriculture officials announced Sunday.\" The verbs here are `killed` and `spread`.  `Spread` is not a Q3 verb. While 15k and 37k is a significant number of animals, the wording \"will have to be killed\" expresses a plan or future event, not a realized impact. Additionally, *killed* is a plain outcome verb and on the excluded list, unless its paired with explicit large-scale impact. So, a \"no.\"\n\nNow comes segment 6: \"Since the outbreak began a month ago, millions of fowl have been killed, many of them in Iowa, which is the nation’s leading egg producer.\" The verbs are `began` and `have been killed`. `Began` is not on the list.  Here, `killed` is a plain outcome verb. The critical part is the phrase \"millions of fowl have been killed,\" indicating a large-scale impact. However, based on the rules and the explicit exclusion in the regex and the cheat sheet, `killed` does *not* qualify as a Q3 verb. Though the clarification v 2.16.2 says the examples for v. 2.16.2 should be considered 'Alarmist' -- like \"millions of birds ***euthanized***\", the core rule and regex exclude *killed* and *euthanized* from the moderate verb list. Strictly following the established guidelines means, despite the scale, this segment is also a \"no\" for Q3.\n\nIn segment 7, \"The latest cases were at a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County,\" I find no qualifying verbs. A \"no.\"\n\nSegment 8 says, \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the cases in birds do not present an immediate public health concern.\" Again, no qualifying verbs, so it's a \"no\" for Q3.\n\nFinally, segment 9: \"No human cases of the avian influenza virus have been detected in the United States. It remains safe to eat poultry products.\"  No moderate verbs, and therefore a \"no.\"\n\nBased on a very close reading of the rules, the regex, and the explicit exclusions, it looks like all these segments are neutral.  All the segments are answered as a 'no'.\n```json\n[\n  \"no\",\n  \"no\",\n  \"no\",\n  \"no\",\n  \"no\",\n  \"no\",\n  \"no\",\n  \"no\",\n  \"no\"\n]\n```\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a loaded rhetorical question.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Loaded Rhetorical Questions (Q4: Alarm)**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got so far, working through this claim-framing task. I'm at Q4 of the decision tree, looking specifically for loaded rhetorical questions that try to whip up alarm. I'm keeping the Bedrock Principle, Symmetry Rule, Context Guard, and Precedence Ladder front and center, of course, and following the mandatory step-by-step process.\n\nEssentially, I'm checking each text segment to see if it asks a question designed to instill fear. So far, after carefully evaluating each one, it's a clear \"no\" across the board. The segments simply don't contain any questions, let alone ones crafted to alarm.\n\nTherefore, my JSON output is going to be straightforward, reflecting this unanimous negative finding. I'll maintain the required format: a JSON array of objects, one for each segment, with the ID, answer (\"no\" in this case), and a brief rationale explaining that no such question was found.\n"}

I'm certain that the \"yes\" for Segment 9 is appropriate, specifically focusing on the phrase \"remains safe to eat poultry products\" as an explicit safety assurance. I've also re-checked all other answers against the Q5 definition and guidelines to assure complete accuracy and adherence to the stated constraints. I've performed the six-point self-audit and am confident in this output.\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states 'No Americans' but lacks the 'minimiser + scale contrast' pattern required for Q6.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Segments for Reassurance: Minimizer + Scale Contrast (Q6)**\n\nOkay, here's my assessment. I've been tasked to analyze these segments for reassurance techniques, specifically looking for the \"Minimizer + Scale Contrast\" pattern in Q6.  My focus is on whether a segment uses minimizer words (like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely\") *alongside* an explicit scale contrast to downplay significance. I have processed each segment step-by-step, meticulously looking for that specific combination.\n\nEssentially, I'm checking if the segment attempts to minimize a potentially alarming situation by saying something like \"only a few cases out of millions\".\n\nHere's my thought process for each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:**  No dice. While the segment uses \"rare,\" that's just a general adjective; there are no minimizers or scale contrasts present. Thus, no Q6 pattern.\n*   **Segment 2:** This is a negative statement about Americans contracting viruses, but doesn't fit Q6. This might be a Q7 (Bare Negation). Q6 pattern missing.\n*   **Segment 3:**  Just historical information about the emergence and spread of the virus. Doesn't contain our pattern. No Q6 elements.\n*   **Segment 4:**  Numbers of animals killed on specific farms, no attempts at downplaying it using minimizers and scales. Again, the Q6 pattern is absent.\n*   **Segment 5:**  Mentions \"millions of fowl\" and \"nation's leading egg producer,\" but no minimizer modifies those scales. Nothing that fits the Q6 criteria.\n*   **Segment 6:**  Just reporting locations of the cases; not using minimizers and/or scales together. Doesn't fit Q6.\n*   **Segment 7:**  States no immediate health concern, falling under Q5 (Explicit Calming). Not a Q6 case.\n\nSo, after a thorough analysis, it's clear: none of these segments contain the specific Q6 pattern. Therefore, for *every* segment, the answer is \"no\". I'm now ready to provide the output in the requested JSON format. I must now transition to the next step, Q7.\n"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'No Americans are recorded to have contracted' is a bare negation without explicit calming.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Bare Negations**\n\nAlright, I'm ready to tackle this. I'm being asked to act as an expert claim-framing coder, specifically focusing on the Q7 stage of this 12-step decision tree. My goal is to determine if each text segment contains a \"bare negation\" *without* an explicit calming cue. If it does, the answer is \"yes\" and the frame is Neutral. If there's a calming cue alongside the negation, it's a \"no\" for Q7 (handled by a higher-precedence question). If neither is present, it's also a \"no.\"\n\nFor segment 1 (ID: seg_v5_14_1002_chunk0), \"Human infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they [human infections] are considered rare, CDC officials have previously said,\" I see \"are considered rare.\" This strikes me as a downplaying of frequency/severity, a form of bare negation. There's no explicit calming cue, so Q7 gets a \"yes.\" I'll quote the relevant part: \"are considered rare.\"\n\nSegment 2 (ID: seg_v5_15_1002_chunk0), \"No Americans are recorded to have contracted highly pathogenic avian flu viruses,\" clearly contains a bare negation: \"No Americans are recorded to have contracted.\" This is a direct \"Evidence Negation,\" so it's a \"yes\" for Q7, and the rationale is, \"No Americans are recorded to have contracted.\"\n\nSegment 3 (ID: seg_v5_16_1002_chunk0), \"The first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world,\" doesn't have any negations, so it's a \"no.\"\n\nSegments 4 (ID: seg_v5_1_100_chunk0), 5 (ID: seg_v5_2_100_chunk0), and 6 (ID: seg_v5_3_100_chunk0) report negative facts. Without any negation or softening of those facts, there are no bare negations. So all are \"no.\"\n\nFinally, segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_5_100_chunk0), \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the cases in birds do not present an immediate public health concern,\" features the phrase \"do not present an immediate public health concern.\" This is, by definition, a bare negation without any calming cue.  Therefore, it's a \"yes\" to Q7. Rationale: \"do not present an immediate public health concern.\"\n\nI've carefully examined each segment and now I'm ready to assemble the JSON array with the results, making sure to include the `segment_id`, `answer`, and the appropriate rationale, keeping in mind the 80-token limit for each rationale.\n"}
