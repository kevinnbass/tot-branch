{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segments for Alarmist Framing (Q1)**\n\nOkay, here's how I approached this. My task was to act as an expert claim-framing coder, specifically focusing on the initial question (Q1) within a 12-step decision tree. I needed to identify if each text segment contained an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a \"risk adjective.\" The prompt stressed that I could *only* use the provided rules and examples, which I took very seriously.\n\nFirst, I established my framework.  I knew the \"risk adjectives\" I should look for: *deadly, lethal, dangerous, severe, catastrophic, brutal, contagious, virulent, destructive*. I also had the list of intensifiers and comparatives: *so, very, extremely, highly (unless part of HPAI), severely, particularly, frighteningly, more, less, deadlier, safer, higher, lower*.\n\nI then meticulously examined each segment.  For each, I was looking for that specific pattern:  an intensifier/comparative *directly* modifying one of the risk adjectives.  I diligently applied the Bedrock Principle and the Symmetry Rule throughout.\n\n*   **Segment 1:** Focused on disease and culling, but no intensifiers/comparatives modifying risk adjectives. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 2:** Discussed public health concern but negated it. No Q1 pattern. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 3:**  Talked about virus spread. \"Spreading\" is a verb, not an adjective. No Q1 pattern. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 4 & 9:** Production and export statistics. No risk adjectives, no intensifiers. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 5 & 10:** Production ranking. Again, no risk adjectives or intensifiers. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 6:** Discusses industry and feed grains. No Q1 elements. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 7:** Market impacts, demand, labor issues. No risk adjectives modified. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 8:** Supply statistics. No Q1 match. \"No.\"\n\nIn all cases, after careful analysis based on the precise prompt requirements, I determined that Q1 was not triggered. Thus, I concluded that none of the text segments presented an \"Alarmist\" frame based *solely* on the first question of the decision tree. I am now prepared to output the JSON array with the \"no\" answers and relevant rationales.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment provides factual information about state ranking, not high-potency verbs or metaphors describing the event's impact.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text for Alarmist Framing: Q2 - High-Potency Verbs/Metaphors**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. My task is to go through each text segment and determine if it triggers the \"Alarmist\" frame based on the presence of high-potency verbs or metaphors, according to a 12-step decision tree. I'm currently at Step Q2, which focuses on identifying these alarmist linguistic cues.\n\nFor each segment, I'm checking for verbs or metaphors that convey a strong sense of threat or urgency, as defined in the provided criteria and regular expression pattern. If I find a match, I'll flag it as \"yes\" and explain my rationale, quoting the specific cue. If not, I'll answer \"no\" and provide a brief explanation.  Importantly, while the alarmist frame *would* be triggered, I am only providing a *Q2* response at this point.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** No high-potency verbs or metaphors here. \"Detected\" and \"culled\" are factual, not alarmist. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 2:** The verb \"present\" is not high-potency. It's a low-risk statement. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 3:** \"Spreading\" is a moderate verb. \"Tested positive\" is factual. Neither meets the Q2 criteria. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 4:** This segment is purely factual about market position. No alarmist language. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 5:** Similar to Segment 4, this is a factual statement. No high-potency verbs. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 6:** Again, factual information. No alarmist language. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 7:** I see the verb \"hitting.\" However, while it is followed by a discussion of impacts, the *boundary guard* explicitly specifies that \"hit\" is Neutral unless a concrete magnitude is given. Here, we *don't* have a number or adjective in this segment to signal magnitude, even though those appear in the *next* segment. So, no alarmist cues here. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 8:** The phrase \"were down\" indicates *state* not *active impact*. The numbers that follow are *magnitude* but do not directly apply to the verb. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 9:** This is a duplicate of Segment 4. No high-potency verbs or metaphors. **Answer: no.**\n*   **Segment 10:** Duplicate of Segment 5. No high-potency verbs or metaphors. **Answer: no.**\n\nAll segments passed Q2. I'm ready to output the JSON array, with the segment ID, \"no\", and the rationale.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "Contains scale ('seventh biggest') but not paired with a moderate verb describing impact.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segments Against Q3**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of how I'd approach these text segments, focusing on applying Q3 and why they fail to meet the criteria.\n\nMy starting point is a clear understanding of what Q3 is looking for: \"moderate verbs\" that denote *realized* impact, coupled with *significant* scale or impact. The \"moderate verbs\" are already defined, and the scale/impact should be explicit, think along the lines of \"millions,\" \"record losses,\" or something equally substantial. Notably, the impact has to be *realized*, not planned or hypothetical.\n\nLet's dive into each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** The phrase \"have already been culled\" uses the verb \"culled,\" which is on the moderate verb list, specifically because of the regular expression `(were|was)\\s+culled`. This looks promising. However, the scale \"a backyard flock\" is where this falls apart. A backyard flock, while potentially a financial loss to the owner, does not meet the criteria for *significant* scale/impact. Q3 requires more substantial figures to trigger a \"yes.\"\n\n*   **Segment 2, 3:** No moderate verbs from my list are present, so a quick \"no\" for these two.\n\n*   **Segments 4, 5, 6, 9, 10:** These segments all mention scale (\"world's largest,\" \"second-largest,\" \"seventh biggest\"), but they lack the necessary \"moderate verb\" to describe a *realized* impact. They're describing context, not the direct impact of the event.\n\n*   **Segment 7:** \"The disease is hitting the market\". The verb \"hitting\" is on the list, but \"the market\" doesn't quite work. The provided examples of \"scale/impact\" are so much more specific and high-magnitude. The other factors in the sentence are descriptive to the backdrop, not indicative of *Q3 magnitude*. That makes this a \"no,\" too.\n\n*   **Segment 8:** Mentions \"down 14 percent\" and \"down 23 percent.\" This represents a decrease, but it doesn't describe the realized impact of any moderate verb, like a \"plunged\" or \"plummeted.\" The impact is inferred, not explicit.\n\nTherefore, after a careful consideration of all segments based on the explicit criteria laid out by Q3, I must determine that all segments fail to meet the requirements to classify the criteria as \"yes\".\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Loaded Rhetorical Questions (Q4: Alarm)**\n\nMy task was to act as an expert claim-framing coder, assessing ten text segments against the fourth step of a 12-step decision tree. Specifically, I needed to determine if each segment contained a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm. My response required a JSON array with segment IDs, answers (yes/no/uncertain), and rationales. If a \"yes\" answer were found, I would have stopped there.\n\nFor each segment, I carefully reviewed the language, focusing on whether it employed rhetorical questions with an underlying goal of instilling alarm. After meticulous analysis, I concluded that none of the provided segments contained such questions.\n\nTherefore, for each segment, the answer to Q4 (\"Does this segment contain a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm?\") is unequivocally \"no.\" The rationale for each \"no\" response is that the segment does not contain a rhetorical question of that nature, instead primarily using factual statements, statistics, or direct reporting of events.\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports an economic fact but lacks explicit calming language.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Segments for Explicit Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, I've got it. I'm acting as a claim-framing expert, strictly adhering to the specified rules (Bedrock Principle, Symmetry Rule, Context Guard, Precedence Ladder, Mandatory Step-by-Step Decision Process), and completing the requested Q5 analysis. My task is to evaluate each text segment for explicit calming cues used for reassurance, such as \"no cause for alarm\" or \"rest assured.\" I'm also going to be sure to quote the cue if I find one.  Let's get into it.\n\n**Segment-by-Segment Breakdown**\n\n*   **Segments 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10:**  After carefully reviewing all of the provided text segments against the Q5 rule, I have determined that none of them contain any explicit calming cues that would indicate reassurance. The segments either report facts (detection, source, economic data) or background information about the situation. No statements like \"no cause for alarm\" or the like appear in these segments.\n\n*   **Segment 2:** This was a bit tricky. The phrase \"do not present an immediate public health concern\" initially might sound reassuring. However, in this 12-step decision tree, such bare negations are categorized as Q7 material. This particular phrase is evaluated at that level.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe explicit calming cue criterion from Q5 was not met in any of the provided segments.

{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a 'minimiser + scale contrast' pattern.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Reassuring Framing: Q6 - Minimiser + Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, I'm currently at step Q6 of the 12-step claim-framing decision tree. My task is to assess several text segments for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern, a key element of reassuring framing. This means I'm looking for the presence of a minimizer (like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few\") *paired* with an explicit or clearly implied scale contrast that downplays the significance of something. I've been given specific criteria: both elements must be present and working together to minimize the impact.\n\nLet's break down how I'm thinking through each segment:\n\n*   **Initial Scan:** First, I'm quickly scanning each segment, mentally noting whether a minimizer immediately jumps out. If not, I'm looking for any clear scale contrasts, like a reference to \"thousands,\" \"millions,\" or a broad \"nationwide\" context.\n*   **Contextual Analysis:** If I spot a potential minimizer or scale contrast, I dig a little deeper. I'm focusing on whether they're *working together* to reassure. Simply finding a minimizer *or* a scale contrast isn't enough; they have to interact to downplay something.\n*   **The Key Question:** The central question I'm asking is: *Does this segment use a minimizer and a scale contrast to reduce the perceived importance or severity of something?*\n*   **The Result:** After a thorough review of each segment, I've concluded that *none* of them meet the Q6 criteria. I was looking very specifically for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern, and while some segments contained elements related to risk (\"do not present an immediate public health concern\") or quantifiers (\"dozens,\" \"almost 18 percent,\" \"seventh biggest\"), none of them used the *specific pattern* I'm looking for at this stage. Therefore, the answer for all segments is \"no.\" My rationale will reflect that the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern was not detected. The segments didn't contain an explicit minimizer like \"only\" or \"just\" combined with a scale.\n"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a bare negation.", "thoughts": "**Applying Q7: Identifying Bare Negations in Text Segments**\n\nAlright, as a claim-framing expert, my focus here is to analyze each text segment for the presence of a specific linguistic pattern: \"bare negations\" without any explicit \"calming cues.\" This falls under the 12-step decision tree, specifically at Question 7 (Q7).\n\nI know the rules cold: if a segment contains a phrase like \"not expected to cause problems\" or \"do not present an immediate public health concern,\" *and* doesn't also include a reassuring phrase (e.g., \"so consumers can rest easy\"), then it gets a \"yes\" answer for Q7. This scenario suggests a *Neutral* frame. Conversely, if there's no bare negation, or if there's one accompanied by a calming cue (which would be framed under a different cue like reassurance), then the answer is \"no.\"\n\nMy approach is systematic: I'm examining each segment individually, looking for the telltale signs of bare negation. My thinking follows this logic:\n\n*   **Scan for the \"Bare Negation\":** First, I'm meticulously searching for those negative phrases within the text.\n*   **Check for the \"Calming Cue\":** If I find a negation, I immediately look for any explicit reassurance or calming language. If it's there, then it's *not* a bare negation.\n*   **Make the Call:** Based on these findings, I'm assigning a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer for Q7. My rationales are concise, highlighting the specific evidence.\n\nHere's my analysis of the segments:\n\n*   **Segment 1 (seg\\_v5\\_012\\_1003\\_chunk0):** This one stands out. It contains the phrase \"do not present an immediate public health concern\" – a textbook example of a bare negation. Critically, there's no reassurance alongside it. Therefore, \"yes\" to Q7.\n*   **Segment 2 through 10:** The remaining segments don't exhibit this pattern at all. They lack the bare negation that I'm looking for. Thus, the answer is \"no\" for each.\n\nMy final output will be a JSON array, meticulously mapping each `segment_id` to its Q7 `answer` and a clear `rationale`.
