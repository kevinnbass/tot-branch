No → *(This path suggests a cue type potentially missed or a nuanced case. Re-evaluate based on comprehensive Alarmist/Reassuring inclusion criteria not fitting simple top-level questions.)*\n\n**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**\n\n**Default-to-Neutral Rule (Strictly Presentation-Focused)**\nHeuristic: In the absence of explicit emotional language, specific framing cues (e.g., loaded adjectives, urgent tone, calming words), or a distinct rhetorical tone from EITHER the segment's author OR any directly quoted source within the segment, Neutral is the appropriate code for Dim1_Frame. \n\n**Crucial Clarification:** This rule applies if both the author's presentation and the presentation by any quoted sources are neutral.\n\n* If a segment reports objectively severe facts, and both the author and any quoted source commenting on these facts use neutral, factual language without added alarmist rhetoric, the Dim1_Frame is Neutral.\n* Similarly, if a segment reports objectively positive facts, and both the author and any quoted source use neutral, factual language without added reassuring rhetoric, the Dim1_Frame is Neutral.\n* The focus remains on the presentation by the author and by any quoted sources.\n\n**Definition: Neutral** (Synthesized from principles, common pitfalls, and examples)\nA segment is Neutral if it presents information factually without significant, explicit linguistic or rhetorical cues from the author or quoted sources that are designed to evoke strong fear, urgency (Alarmist), or to actively calm, reassure, or minimize risk (Reassuring). Neutral framing reports events, facts, or statements, even if objectively severe or positive, in a straightforward, descriptive manner.\n\n**Examples of Neutral Framing:**\n* **Severe Fact, Neutral Presentation:**\n  * Segment: \"The report documented 500,000 job losses in the last quarter.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Neutral. The author reports a severe statistic factually. No loaded language, intensifiers, or explicit alarmist rhetoric (e.g., 'a catastrophic wave of job losses,' 'an economic disaster unfolding') is used by the author to frame this fact.\"\n* **Positive Fact, Neutral Presentation:**\n  * Segment: \"Vaccination rates reached 80% in the target population.\"\n  * Reasoning: \"Neutral. The author reports a positive statistic factually. No explicit reassuring language (e.g., 'a wonderfully high rate providing excellent protection,' 'this achievement means the community is now safe') is used by the author.\"\n\n**Canonical NON-EXAMPLES:**\n* **NON-EXAMPLE for Reassuring (Code: Neutral):**\n  * Text: \"Despite the health department conducting contact tracing, no further cases of bird flu connected to the case have been reported at the time of writing.\"\n  * Correct Codebook Reasoning: \"Neutral. The author reports a positive fact (absence of new cases) using descriptive, neutral language. No explicit reassuring language...is used by the author to actively frame these facts reassuringly.\"\n* **NON-EXAMPLE for Alarmist (Code: Neutral):**\n  * Text: \"These [characteristics] include a wide host range, high mutation rate, genetic reassortment, high mortality rates, and genetic reassortment.\"\n  * Correct Codebook Reasoning: \"Neutral. The author lists factual characteristics using neutral, descriptive language. No loaded adjectives...or explicit alarmist rhetoric are used by the author to actively frame these characteristics beyond their factual statement.\"\n\n**Further characteristics of Neutral framing include:**\n* Factual descriptions of phenomena that inherently possess negative-sounding descriptors (e.g., 'a high fever,' 'a high mortality rate,' 'a rapidly spreading virus') if the author/source does not add further explicit alarmist framing.\n* Listing a fatality/damage rate, case/incident count, or R-value/metric without evaluative language or alarming tone from either the quoted source or the author.\n* Reporting standard descriptive terms for negative events (e.g., 'outbreak,' 'death,' 'illness,' 'culling,' 'risk,' 'concern,' 'epidemic,' 'potential for X,' 'active outbreaks') without additional explicit alarmist cues.\n* Epistemic modals (e.g., 'could,' 'might,' 'may') expressing possibility alone, unless the potential outcome is itself framed with strong alarmist intensifiers or paired with other alarmist cues.\n* Technical terms, official classifications, and procedural language reported as factual designations.\n\n**Examples from other Rules that default to Neutral:**\n* **Neutral (Capability/Preparedness - Rule C, Q8):** \"The agency has developed a rapid deployment plan for emergencies.\"\n* **Neutral (Bare Negation - Q7):** \"Not expected to lower production.\"\n* **Neutral (Factual Reporting of Prices/Metrics - Q9):** \"Market prices for wheat decreased by 2% this month.\"\n* **Neutral (Speculation about Relief - Q10):** \"Experts predict that the supply chain issues could ease in the next quarter.\"\n\n**Regex Pattern:** `\\b(report|document|state|announce|confirm|detect|identify|record)\\w*\\b.*\\b(cases|deaths|losses|rates|numbers|percent)\\b`\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain|unknown\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, explaining why no explicit framing cues remain and facts are presented neutrally>\"\n}\n``` \nYou will answer the **same question** (Q12) for EACH segment listed below.\nRespond with **one JSON array**. Each element must contain: `segment_id`, `answer`, `rationale`.\nReturn NOTHING except valid JSON.\n\n### Segment 1 (ID: seg_v5_1_1_chunk0)\nAuthorities in eastern Poland say bird flu is responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in poultry farms near the country's borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\n\n### Segment 2 (ID: seg_v5_4_1_chunk0)\nThe chief veterinarian for Lublin province, Pawel Piotrowski, confirmed that the deadly H5N8 virus was responsible for the turkey deaths in two farms in the village of Stary Uscimow, which lies 45 kilometers (28 miles) from the borders with Ukraine and Belarus. It was not clear how the bird flu virus found its way to the farms.\n\n### Segment 3 (ID: seg_v5_013_1003_chunk0)\nWild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\n\n### Segment 4 (ID: seg_v5_16_1002_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 5 (ID: seg_v5_2_100_chunk0)\nSince the outbreak began a month ago, millions of fowl have been killed, many of them in Iowa, which is the nation’s leading egg producer.\n\n### Segment 6 (ID: seg_v5_3_100_chunk0)\nThe latest cases were at a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County.\n\n### Segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_002_1003_chunk0)\nInfections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_003_1003_chunk0)\nLast week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_004_1003_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials said.\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_010_1003_chunk0)\nOn Tuesday, Kentucky officials expect final test results for a separate suspected outbreak among turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_12_1000_chunk0)\nLast week, Mexico joined several other countries in banning or limiting poultry imports from Indiana following the disease outbreak.\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_1_1002_chunk0)\nAccording to the agency, bird flu was found in Fauquier County, Virginia; and in Fulton County, Kentucky, on Feb. 12, in non-poultry birds and commercial broiler chickens, respectively.\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_2_1002_chunk0)\nOn Feb. 8, bird influenza was detected in commercial turkeys in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_6_1002_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID: seg_v5_8_1002_chunk0)\nTyson Foods Inc. confirmed that a flock of about 240,000 chickens tested positive.\n\n### Segment 16 (ID: seg_v5_12_1005_chunk0)\nThe strain now circulating is H5N1 and is related to the 2015 virus.\n\n### Segment 17 (ID: seg_v5_13_1005_chunk0)\nIt [H5N1] has been circulating for months in Europe and Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the U.S. case was identified.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_20_1005_chunk0)\n“With the increased preparatory efforts USDA and its partners have put into place since the 2015 HPAI outbreak, we are fully prepared to handle this detection,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA, which deals with outbreaks on U.S.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_2_1001_chunk0)\nDozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_7_1001_chunk0)\nTest results are still pending for a separate flock in Webster County.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_10_1001_chunk0)\nPoultry farms in Africa, Europe, and Asia are also dealing with avian flu.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_3_10_chunk0)\nThe government did not immediately report the exact strain of bird flu that infected chickens on the farm.\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_5_10_chunk0)\nAnother 34 farms are situated within a 10-kilometer (6 mile) radius of the infected location.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_2_1005_chunk0)\nThe new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_9_1005_chunk0)\nThe 2015 outbreak led producers to kill 33 million egg-laying hens in Iowa, the nation’s leading egg producer, and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation’s leading turkey producer, with smaller outbreaks in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\n### Segment 26 (ID: seg_v5_2_1004_chunk0)\nThe United States Department of Agriculture confirmed Feb. 9 that a commercial turkey flock in Indiana was hit with avian flu, the first case in the U.S. since 2020.\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_4_1004_chunk0)\nThen on Feb. 14, the agency confirmed that a commercial flock of broiler chickens was hit with bird flu in Kentucky, and a backyard flock of mixed species fowl also tested positive in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_12_1006_chunk0)\nThe virus is spread by migratory birds and waterfowl, usually this time of year.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_16_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_26_1007_chunk0)\nThe site currently lists three cases in commercial birds during the current outbreak.\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_27_1007_chunk0)\nThis [list of cases] includes commercial turkeys, a mixed-species backyard flock in Fauquier County, Virginia, and the broiler chicken flock in Fulton County, Kentucky, belonging to Tyson foods.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_28_1007_chunk0)\nThis article and its headline were updated to clarify a barn of chickens among a flock of 240,000 birds was infected with bird flu.\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_1_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_2_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA also said HPAI was found in a backyard flock in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_3_1006_chunk0)\nLast week, the presence of HPAI was found in a commercial turkey flock of 30,000 in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 36 (ID: seg_v5_1_1007_chunk0)\nChickens in one barn among a flock of 240,000 birds belonging to Tyson Foods have become infected with a lethal form of bird flu, the company confirmed.\n\n### Segment 37 (ID: seg_v5_2_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery intensifies an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. that involves poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia, and follows the destruction of 29,000 turkeys in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 38 (ID: seg_v5_5_1007_chunk0)\nA spokesperson for Tyson Foods told Newsweek one barn among a flock of 240,000 in Kentucky had chickens that tested positive for bird flu.\n\n### Segment 39 (ID: seg_v5_7_1007_chunk0)\nAlthough the origin of the infection is not known, avian influenza has been found in migratory wild birds, which play a significant role in spreading the disease.'\n\n### Segment 40 (ID: seg_v5_9_1007_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 700 cases of bird flu in humans have been recorded globally since November 2003.\n\n### Segment 41 (ID: seg_v5_11_1007_chunk0)\nInfection usually occurs as a result of infected birds shedding avian virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces which then gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled.\n\n### Segment 42 (ID: seg_v5_12_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC adds that this [infection via shedding/contact] can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or even possibly dust and a person breathes it [the virus] in, or when a person touches something that has the virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.\n\n### Segment 43 (ID: seg_v5_13_1007_chunk0)\nCross infection also usually occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses.\n\n### Segment 44 (ID: seg_v5_14_1007_chunk0)\nBut, the CDC reports some infections have been identified where direct contact was not known to have occurred.\n\n### Segment 45 (ID: seg_v5_15_1007_chunk0)\nWhen a person is infected with avian flu the resultant illness ranges from mild to severe.\n\n### Segment 46 (ID: seg_v5_16_1007_chunk0)\nIn January, Newsweek reported on a rare case of avian flu crossing over to a human in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Segment 47 (ID: seg_v5_19_1007_chunk0)\nThese infections [human infections] are concerning for non-health-related reasons, however, especially if more poultry operations in the country are found to be affected.\n\n### Segment 48 (ID: seg_v5_11_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this month, a strain of avian flu was confirmed at a commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana.\n\n### Segment 49 (ID: seg_v5_11_1009_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 50 (ID: seg_v5_13_1009_chunk0)\nIn a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 51 (ID: seg_v5_16_1009_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 52 (ID: seg_v5_3_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this week, the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed the presence of bird flu in Kentucky and Virginia, reigniting fears of another widespread bird flu outbreak.\n\n### Segment 53 (ID: seg_v5_4_1008_chunk0)\nBird flu can cause high mortality rates among birds.\n\n### Segment 54 (ID: seg_v5_6_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA said it detected the presence of the virus in an undisclosed number of birds from a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 55 (ID: seg_v5_8_1008_chunk0)\nTyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 56 (ID: seg_v5_9_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA is awaiting results of a potential second case about 124 miles northeast in Webster County, Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 57 (ID: seg_v5_10_1008_chunk0)\nMeanwhile, a backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also tested positive for the virus.\n\n### Segment 58 (ID: seg_v5_1_1009_chunk0)\nA \"highly pathogenic\" form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\n### Segment 59 (ID: seg_v5_2_1009_chunk0)\nThe virus was detected in a small, non-commercial backyard block that was not being used for poultry purposes, the agency [USDA] said.\n\n### Segment 60 (ID: seg_v5_10_1009_chunk0)\nIt [the detection in New York] came after the virus was discovered in flocks of birds in Kentucky, Virginia, and Indiana.\n\n### Segment 61 (ID: seg_v5_2_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_9_1000_chunk0)\nAuthorities believe wild birds have been spreading the virus, after dozens recently tested positive for the flu along the East Coast, Reuters reported.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_22_101_chunk0)\nCan I expect to pay more for poultry products?\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_25_101_chunk0)\nIf infections course through more flocks, experts said, there could be some shortages of eggs.\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_29_101_chunk0)\nThe samples are sent to diagnostic labs to be analyzed.\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_30_101_chunk0)\nOutbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_31_101_chunk0)\nAs of March 31, the highly pathogenic form of the avian flu had been detected in 19 states, a tracking page maintained by the U.S.D.A. showed.\n\n### Segment 68 (ID: seg_v5_32_101_chunk0)\nThe combined number of birds in the infected flocks -- the commercial and backyard type -- totaled more than 17 million, according to the agency.\n\n### Segment 69 (ID: seg_v5_34_101_chunk0)\nAn commercial egg production facility in Buena Vista County, Iowa, constituted the largest infected flock and was made up of more than 5.3 million chickens, the U.S.D.A. said.\n\n### Segment 70 (ID: seg_v5_35_101_chunk0)\nA producer of eggs in Jefferson County, Wis., was next on the list, with more than 2.7 million chickens.\n\n### Segment 71 (ID: seg_v5_36_101_chunk0)\nA commercial poultry flock in New Castle County, Del., was the third-largest infected flock, with more than 1.1 million chickens.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_37_101_chunk0)\nHow do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_39_101_chunk0)\nNearly 50 million birds died, either from the virus or from having to be culled, a majority of them in Iowa or Minnesota.\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_40_101_chunk0)\nThe footprint of the current outbreak, extending from the Midwest and Plains to northern New England, has raised concerns.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_1_101_chunk0)\nMore than 15 million chickens and turkeys from infected commercial and backyard flocks in 19 states have been killed, officials said.\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_3_101_chunk0)\nIowa has been particularly hard hit, with disasters being declared in some counties and the state canceling live bird exhibits in an order that may affect its famed state fair.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_5_101_chunk0)\nIt [Avian influenza] spreads via nasal secretions, saliva and fecal droppings, which experts say makes it [spread] difficult to contain.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_6_101_chunk0)\nSymptoms of the virus include a sudden increase in the mortality of a flock, a drop in egg production and diminished consumption of feed and water.\n\n### Segment 79 (ID: seg_v5_7_101_chunk0)\nThe virus, Eurasian H5N1, is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry.\n\n### Segment 80 (ID: seg_v5_8_101_chunk0)\nIts prevalence in the United States is not unexpected, with outbreaks previously reported in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.\n\n### Segment 81 (ID: seg_v5_9_101_chunk0)\nShould humans be worried about being infected?\n\n### Segment 82 (ID: seg_v5_014_1010_chunk0)\nHowever, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\n\n### Segment 83 (ID: seg_v5_015_1010_chunk0)\nNonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak [of H5N1].\n\n### Segment 84 (ID: seg_v5_41_101_chunk0)\nI think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n### Segment 85 (ID: seg_v5_42_101_chunk0)\nWhat can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\n\n### Segment 86 (ID: seg_v5_45_101_chunk0)\nSharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus.\n\n### Segment 87 (ID: seg_v5_46_101_chunk0)\nSo can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting.\n\n### Segment 88 (ID: seg_v5_49_101_chunk0)\nIs it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys?\n\n### Segment 89 (ID: seg_v5_50_101_chunk0)\nInfected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 90 (ID: seg_v5_001_1010_chunk0)\nCases of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in Indiana, Virginia, and Kentucky, posing a likely threat to the

  "thoughts": "**Expert Analysis: Bird Flu Text Segments**\n\nBased on the provided text segments and the Q12 framework for identifying neutral framing, I've conducted a thorough analysis, focusing on the presence of explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues. My expert assessment, using the rules and the nuances of the language, has yielded the following results:\n\nThe default rule of Q12 applies. If I do not find an explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cue, the default frame is Neutral and I will respond to Q12 with \"yes\". If there *is* an explicit cue that activates alarmist or reassuring before Q12, I'll answer \"no\" and provide an explanation.\n\n*   **Segment-by-Segment Breakdown:**\n\n    *   **seg\\_v5\\_1\\_1\\_chunk0**: Q12: yes.
