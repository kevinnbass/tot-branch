Segment 54 (ID: seg_v5_3_1006_chunk0)\nLast week, the presence of HPAI was found in a commercial turkey flock of 30,000 in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 55 (ID: seg_v5_4_1006_chunk0)\nIf the disease spreads to enough farms in a geographic region, it could impact the production of chicken, turkey and eggs, raising consumer prices and impacting exports.\n\n### Segment 56 (ID: seg_v5_6_1006_chunk0)\nIn 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\n\n### Segment 57 (ID: seg_v5_8_1006_chunk0)\nEgg exports dropped 13% and turkey 23%.\n\n### Segment 58 (ID: seg_v5_9_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA estimated the cost to the federal government was more than $1 billion $879 million to manage the crisis and about $200 million in indemnities for lost birds.\n\n### Segment 59 (ID: seg_v5_1_1007_chunk0)\nChickens in one barn among a flock of 240,000 birds belonging to Tyson Foods have become infected with a lethal form of bird flu, the company confirmed.\n\n### Segment 60 (ID: seg_v5_2_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery intensifies an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. that involves poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia, and follows the destruction of 29,000 turkeys in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 61 (ID: seg_v5_5_1007_chunk0)\nA spokesperson for Tyson Foods told Newsweek one barn among a flock of 240,000 in Kentucky had chickens that tested positive for bird flu.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_7_1007_chunk0)\nAlthough the origin of the infection is not known, avian influenza has been found in migratory wild birds, which play a significant role in spreading the disease.'\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_9_1007_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 700 cases of bird flu in humans have been recorded globally since November 2003.\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_11_1007_chunk0)\nInfection usually occurs as a result of infected birds shedding avian virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces which then gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled.\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_12_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC adds that this [infection via shedding/contact] can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or even possibly dust and a person breathes it [the virus] in, or when a person touches something that has the virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_13_1007_chunk0)\nCross infection also usually occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses.\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_14_1007_chunk0)\nBut, the CDC reports some infections have been identified where direct contact was not known to have occurred.\n\n### Segment 68 (ID: seg_v5_15_1007_chunk0)\nWhen a person is infected with avian flu the resultant illness ranges from mild to severe.\n\n### Segment 69 (ID: seg_v5_16_1007_chunk0)\nIn January, Newsweek reported on a rare case of avian flu crossing over to a human in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Segment 70 (ID: seg_v5_19_1007_chunk0)\nThese infections [human infections] are concerning for non-health-related reasons, however, especially if more poultry operations in the country are found to be affected.\n\n### Segment 71 (ID: seg_v5_20_1007_chunk0)\nAccording to the USDA, the U.S. is the world's top producer of poultry, and number two in terms of exports, following the top exporter Brazil.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_11_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this month, a strain of avian flu was confirmed at a commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana.\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_11_1009_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_13_1009_chunk0)\nIn a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_16_1009_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_3_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this week, the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed the presence of bird flu in Kentucky and Virginia, reigniting fears of another widespread bird flu outbreak.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_4_1008_chunk0)\nBird flu can cause high mortality rates among birds.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_5_1008_chunk0)\nIn 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\n\n### Segment 79 (ID: seg_v5_6_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA said it detected the presence of the virus in an undisclosed number of birds from a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 80 (ID: seg_v5_8_1008_chunk0)\nTyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 81 (ID: seg_v5_9_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA is awaiting results of a potential second case about 124 miles northeast in Webster County, Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 82 (ID: seg_v5_10_1008_chunk0)\nMeanwhile, a backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also tested positive for the virus.\n\n### Segment 83 (ID: seg_v5_1_1009_chunk0)\nA \"highly pathogenic\" form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\n### Segment 84 (ID: seg_v5_2_1009_chunk0)\nThe virus was detected in a small, non-commercial backyard block that was not being used for poultry purposes, the agency [USDA] said.\n\n### Segment 85 (ID: seg_v5_10_1009_chunk0)\nIt [the detection in New York] came after the virus was discovered in flocks of birds in Kentucky, Virginia, and Indiana.\n\n### Segment 86 (ID: seg_v5_2_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\n\n### Segment 87 (ID: seg_v5_9_1000_chunk0)\nAuthorities believe wild birds have been spreading the virus, after dozens recently tested positive for the flu along the East Coast, Reuters reported.\n\n### Segment 88 (ID: seg_v5_22_101_chunk0)\nCan I expect to pay more for poultry products?\n\n### Segment 89 (ID: seg_v5_24_101_chunk0)\nRecently, the average price of premium large white eggs has been 'trending sharply higher,' according to a March 25 national retail report released by the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 90 (ID: seg_v5_25_101_chunk0)\nIf infections course through more flocks, experts said, there could be some shortages of eggs.\n\n### Segment 91 (ID: seg_v5_26_101_chunk0)\nPrices for white and dark chicken meat were also rising, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 92 (ID: seg_v5_27_101_chunk0)\nExperts also warned that turkey prices could also become more volatile.\n\n### Segment 93 (ID: seg_v5_29_101_chunk0)\nThe samples are sent to diagnostic labs to be analyzed.\n\n### Segment 94 (ID: seg_v5_30_101_chunk0)\nOutbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\n\n### Segment 95 (ID: seg_v5_31_101_chunk0)\nAs of March 31, the highly pathogenic form of the avian flu had been detected in 19 states, a tracking page maintained by the U.S.D.A. showed.\n\n### Segment 96 (ID: seg_v5_32_101_chunk0)\nThe combined number of birds in the infected flocks -- the commercial and backyard type -- totaled more than 17 million, according to the agency.\n\n### Segment 97 (ID: seg_v5_34_101_chunk0)\nAn commercial egg production facility in Buena Vista County, Iowa, constituted the largest infected flock and was made up of more than 5.3 million chickens, the U.S.D.A. said.\n\n### Segment 98 (ID: seg_v5_35_101_chunk0)\nA producer of eggs in Jefferson County, Wis., was next on the list, with more than 2.7 million chickens.\n\n### Segment 99 (ID: seg_v5_36_101_chunk0)\nA commercial poultry flock in New Castle County, Del., was the third-largest infected flock, with more than 1.1 million chickens.\n\n### Segment 100 (ID: seg_v5_37_101_chunk0)\nHow do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\n\n### Segment 101 (ID: seg_v5_39_101_chunk0)\nNearly 50 million birds died, either from the virus or from having to be culled, a majority of them in Iowa or Minnesota.\n\n### Segment 102 (ID: seg_v5_40_101_chunk0)\nThe footprint of the current outbreak, extending from the Midwest and Plains to northern New England, has raised concerns.\n\n### Segment 103 (ID: seg_v5_1_101_chunk0)\nMore than 15 million chickens and turkeys from infected commercial and backyard flocks in 19 states have been killed, officials said.\n\n### Segment 104 (ID: seg_v5_3_101_chunk0)\nIowa has been particularly hard hit, with disasters being declared in some counties and the state canceling live bird exhibits in an order that may affect its famed state fair.\n\n### Segment 105 (ID: seg_v5_5_101_chunk0)\nIt [Avian influenza] spreads via nasal secretions, saliva and fecal droppings, which experts say makes it [spread] difficult to contain.\n\n### Segment 106 (ID: seg_v5_6_101_chunk0)\nSymptoms of the virus include a sudden increase in the mortality of a flock, a drop in egg production and diminished consumption of feed and water.\n\n### Segment 107 (ID: seg_v5_7_101_chunk0)\nThe virus, Eurasian H5N1, is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry.\n\n### Segment 108 (ID: seg_v5_8_101_chunk0)\nIts prevalence in the United States is not unexpected, with outbreaks previously reported in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.\n\n### Segment 109 (ID: seg_v5_9_101_chunk0)\nShould humans be worried about being infected?\n\n### Segment 110 (ID: seg_v5_014_1010_chunk0)\nHowever, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\n\n### Segment 111 (ID: seg_v5_015_1010_chunk0)\nNonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak [of H5N1].\n\n### Segment 112 (ID: seg_v5_41_101_chunk0)\nI think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n### Segment 113 (ID: seg_v5_42_101_chunk0)\nWhat can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\n\n### Segment 114 (ID: seg_v5_45_101_chunk0)\nSharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus.\n\n### Segment 115 (ID: seg_v5_46_101_chunk0)\nSo can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting.\n\n### Segment 116 (ID: seg_v5_49_101_chunk0)\nIs it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys?\n\n### Segment 117 (ID: seg_v5_50_101_chunk0)\nInfected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 118 (ID: seg_v5_001_1010_chunk0)\nCases of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in Indiana, Virginia, and Kentucky, posing a likely threat to the United States' domestic supply of chicken and turkey this winter.\n\n\n# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#  GLOBAL FOOTER – 6-POINT SELF-AUDIT (read *after* hop
