No (or quotes are Neutral/balanced/absent, or authorial frame is dominant) → Proceed to Q12.\n\n**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**\n\n**Guidance Note: Primacy of Framed Quotations (SUPERSEDES PREVIOUS QUOTE RULES)**\n**Technical-term override (v 2.17)**  \nBefore deciding that a quoted risk-adjective is Alarmist under Q11,  \n**skip** the cue if the adjective is immediately preceded (≤ 3 tokens) by the\nwhitelisted biomedical collocations:  \n*\"highly pathogenic\"*, *\"highly pathogenic avian\"*, *\"HPAI\"*.  \nRationale: Q1 technical-term guard has higher precedence and treats these\nas neutral taxonomy, not intensification.\n\n**Preparedness safety-link check (v 2.18)**  \nWhen a quote says *\"fully/well prepared (ready) to handle/deal with …\"* **but** lacks an explicit public/consumer safety link within 40 chars (e.g., \"so consumers are safe\"), treat it as **Neutral** rather than Reassuring.\n\nCore Principle: If a direct quotation (or a clearly attributed statement from a specific source) within the segment carries a distinct Alarmist or Reassuring frame, the segment's Dim1_Frame MUST reflect the frame of that quotation/attributed statement. This principle applies even if the author's narrative surrounding the quote is Neutral. The frame is determined by the language and tone used by the quoted source itself.\n\n**Key Scenarios:**\n* **Author's Neutrality:** When the author neutrally reports a framed quote, the quote's frame dictates the segment's frame.\n* **Author Reinforces Quote's Frame:** If the author's narrative also adopts or amplifies the same frame as the quote, this further strengthens the coding of the quote's frame.\n* **Author Challenges Quote's Frame (Advanced):** If the author explicitly challenges, refutes, or heavily recontextualizes the quote's frame using their own explicit framing language, the coder must determine the overall dominant frame of the segment. If the author merely presents a factual counterpoint after a framed quote, without adding their own framing to that counterpoint, the original quote's frame is more likely to prevail or be balanced to Neutral (see Mixed Messages). This scenario requires careful judgment of which frame is more salient. (For most cases, assume the author is not overtly challenging if they present the quote straightforwardly).\n\n**Multiple Framed Quotes & Mixed Messages within a Single Quote:**\n* If a segment contains multiple quotes with different frames, determine the dominant frame. If one quote is significantly more potent or central to the segment's point, its frame may prevail.\n\n**Handling Mixed Messages with Contrastive Conjunctions (e.g., 'but,' 'however'):**\nWhen a single quoted statement contains potentially mixed framing elements, particularly when linked by contrasting conjunctions (e.g., 'but,' 'however'):\n* **Evaluate Each Clause for Explicit Framing:** Independently assess the clause before the conjunction and the clause after the conjunction for the presence of explicit framing cues that meet the definitions for Alarmist or Reassuring in this codebook. This means applying the full Alarmist/Reassuring/Neutral definitions to each part of the source's statement.\n* **Framing Strength of the Concluding Clause:** For the clause after the conjunction to override or neutralize an explicitly framed initial clause, it MUST ITSELF contain clear and explicit framing language that meets the criteria for Reassuring or Alarmist. A neutrally worded factual statement, even if it factually counters or mitigates the initial clause, does not typically establish a new frame nor neutralize a potent initial frame on its own.\n\n**Resolution Scenarios:**\n* **Explicit Frame in Second Clause:** If the second clause contains explicit framing cues (Reassuring or Alarmist) that are at least as potent as, or more potent than, the first clause (per 'Principle of Cue Sufficiency'), it will generally determine or significantly influence the segment's frame.\n* **No Explicit Framing in Second Clause (Canonical Example):**\n  * Text: \"Meanwhile, Kirby Institute head of biosecurity Professor Raina MacIntyre described the bird flu news as 'concerning.' She [Professor Raina MacIntyre] said, however, that Avian flu viruses do not transmit easily in humans because they [Avian flu viruses] are adapted for birds.\"\n  * Correct Code: Neutral.\n  * Reasoning: \"The source provides an initial mild-to-moderate alarm cue ('concerning'). The subsequent clause, introduced by 'however,' states a fact ('do not transmit easily') that has reassuring implications but is itself presented by the source without any explicit reassuring language from the source (e.g., no 'thankfully,' 'which is excellent news,' 'so the public can rest easy,' 'this low transmissibility means the risk is negligible'). The neutrally-presented factual counter-statement balances the initial mild concern without the second part actively meeting the criteria for a Reassuring frame on its own. Thus, the overall segment is Neutral.\"\n\n**Additional Contrastive Examples:**\n* **Example 1:**\n  * Text: \"Quote: 'The outbreak is troubling, but no human infections have been detected,' stated the health commissioner.\"\n  * Correct Code: Neutral.\n  * Reasoning: \"The source provides a mild alarm cue ('troubling'). The subsequent clause states a positive fact ('no human infections detected') without explicit reassuring framing from the source. The factual counter-statement balances the initial concern, resulting in Neutral rather than Reassuring.\"\n* **Example 2:**\n  * Text: \"Quote: 'While cases have increased by 15%, testing capabilities remain adequate,' the director confirmed.\"\n  * Correct Code: Neutral.\n  * Reasoning: \"Neither clause contains explicit framing. The negative fact (case increase) and positive capability statement are both presented factually by the source without alarm or reassuring amplification. Both parts are neutrally stated, resulting in Neutral overall.\"\n\n**IMPORTANT:** If you answer \"yes\", you MUST append \"||FRAME=Alarmist\" or \"||FRAME=Reassuring\" to your rationale (exact spelling).\n\n**Regex Pattern:** \n```regex\n# same as before **but** negative‑look‑behind for technical term\n[\"'\"\"''](?<!highly\\s+pathogenic\\s)(?<!highly\\s+pathogenic\\savian\\s)(?<!hpai\\s)\n   [^\"']*\\b(catastrophic|devastating|alarming|reassuring|safe|under control|no cause for alarm)\\b[^\"']*[\"']\n```\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'.

according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 5 (ID: seg_v5_2_100_chunk0)\nSince the outbreak began a month ago, millions of fowl have been killed, many of them in Iowa, which is the nation’s leading egg producer.\n\n### Segment 6 (ID: seg_v5_3_100_chunk0)\nThe latest cases were at a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County.\n\n### Segment 7 (ID: seg_v5_002_1003_chunk0)\nInfections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 8 (ID: seg_v5_003_1003_chunk0)\nLast week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\n\n### Segment 9 (ID: seg_v5_004_1003_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials said.\n\n### Segment 10 (ID: seg_v5_010_1003_chunk0)\nOn Tuesday, Kentucky officials expect final test results for a separate suspected outbreak among turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 11 (ID: seg_v5_12_1000_chunk0)\nLast week, Mexico joined several other countries in banning or limiting poultry imports from Indiana following the disease outbreak.\n\n### Segment 12 (ID: seg_v5_1_1002_chunk0)\nAccording to the agency, bird flu was found in Fauquier County, Virginia; and in Fulton County, Kentucky, on Feb. 12, in non-poultry birds and commercial broiler chickens, respectively.\n\n### Segment 13 (ID: seg_v5_2_1002_chunk0)\nOn Feb. 8, bird influenza was detected in commercial turkeys in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 14 (ID: seg_v5_6_1002_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 15 (ID: seg_v5_8_1002_chunk0)\nTyson Foods Inc. confirmed that a flock of about 240,000 chickens tested positive.\n\n### Segment 16 (ID: seg_v5_12_1005_chunk0)\nThe strain now circulating is H5N1 and is related to the 2015 virus.\n\n### Segment 17 (ID: seg_v5_13_1005_chunk0)\nIt [H5N1] has been circulating for months in Europe and Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the U.S. case was identified.\n\n### Segment 18 (ID: seg_v5_20_1005_chunk0)\n“With the increased preparatory efforts USDA and its partners have put into place since the 2015 HPAI outbreak, we are fully prepared to handle this detection,” said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA, which deals with outbreaks on U.S.\n\n### Segment 19 (ID: seg_v5_2_1001_chunk0)\nDozens of wild birds have tested positive along the East Coast in recent weeks, including three in the Carolinas last month.\n\n### Segment 20 (ID: seg_v5_7_1001_chunk0)\nTest results are still pending for a separate flock in Webster County.\n\n### Segment 21 (ID: seg_v5_10_1001_chunk0)\nPoultry farms in Africa, Europe, and Asia are also dealing with avian flu.\n\n### Segment 22 (ID: seg_v5_3_10_chunk0)\nThe government did not immediately report the exact strain of bird flu that infected chickens on the farm.\n\n### Segment 23 (ID: seg_v5_5_10_chunk0)\nAnother 34 farms are situated within a 10-kilometer (6 mile) radius of the infected location.\n\n### Segment 24 (ID: seg_v5_2_1005_chunk0)\nThe new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 25 (ID: seg_v5_6_1005_chunk0)\n“It’s definitely considered a period of high risk now that we have a confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the commercial poultry industry,” said Dr. Denise Heard, a poultry veterinarian and vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association.\n\n### Segment 26 (ID: seg_v5_9_1005_chunk0)\nThe 2015 outbreak led producers to kill 33 million egg-laying hens in Iowa, the nation’s leading egg producer, and 9 million birds in Minnesota, the nation’s leading turkey producer, with smaller outbreaks in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\n### Segment 27 (ID: seg_v5_2_1004_chunk0)\nThe United States Department of Agriculture confirmed Feb. 9 that a commercial turkey flock in Indiana was hit with avian flu, the first case in the U.S. since 2020.\n\n### Segment 28 (ID: seg_v5_4_1004_chunk0)\nThen on Feb. 14, the agency confirmed that a commercial flock of broiler chickens was hit with bird flu in Kentucky, and a backyard flock of mixed species fowl also tested positive in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 29 (ID: seg_v5_12_1006_chunk0)\nThe virus is spread by migratory birds and waterfowl, usually this time of year.\n\n### Segment 30 (ID: seg_v5_16_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods did not say how it would euthanize the flock.\n\n### Segment 31 (ID: seg_v5_26_1007_chunk0)\nThe site currently lists three cases in commercial birds during the current outbreak.\n\n### Segment 32 (ID: seg_v5_27_1007_chunk0)\nThis [list of cases] includes commercial turkeys, a mixed-species backyard flock in Fauquier County, Virginia, and the broiler chicken flock in Fulton County, Kentucky, belonging to Tyson foods.\n\n### Segment 33 (ID: seg_v5_28_1007_chunk0)\nThis article and its headline were updated to clarify a barn of chickens among a flock of 240,000 birds was infected with bird flu.\n\n### Segment 34 (ID: seg_v5_1_1006_chunk0)\nTyson Foods, the country's largest producer of chicken, confirmed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has infected a flock at one of its contract farms in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 35 (ID: seg_v5_2_1006_chunk0)\nUSDA also said HPAI was found in a backyard flock in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 36 (ID: seg_v5_3_1006_chunk0)\nLast week, the presence of HPAI was found in a commercial turkey flock of 30,000 in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 37 (ID:

seg_v5_2_1007_chunk0)\nThe discovery intensifies an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. that involves poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia, and follows the destruction of 29,000 turkeys in Indiana.\n\n### Segment 39 (ID: seg_v5_5_1007_chunk0)\nA spokesperson for Tyson Foods told Newsweek one barn among a flock of 240,000 in Kentucky had chickens that tested positive for bird flu.\n\n### Segment 40 (ID: seg_v5_7_1007_chunk0)\nAlthough the origin of the infection is not known, avian influenza has been found in migratory wild birds, which play a significant role in spreading the disease.'\n\n### Segment 41 (ID: seg_v5_9_1007_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 700 cases of bird flu in humans have been recorded globally since November 2003.\n\n### Segment 42 (ID: seg_v5_11_1007_chunk0)\nInfection usually occurs as a result of infected birds shedding avian virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces which then gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled.\n\n### Segment 43 (ID: seg_v5_12_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC adds that this [infection via shedding/contact] can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or even possibly dust and a person breathes it [the virus] in, or when a person touches something that has the virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.\n\n### Segment 44 (ID: seg_v5_13_1007_chunk0)\nCross infection also usually occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses.\n\n### Segment 45 (ID: seg_v5_14_1007_chunk0)\nBut, the CDC reports some infections have been identified where direct contact was not known to have occurred.\n\n### Segment 46 (ID: seg_v5_15_1007_chunk0)\nWhen a person is infected with avian flu the resultant illness ranges from mild to severe.\n\n### Segment 47 (ID: seg_v5_16_1007_chunk0)\nIn January, Newsweek reported on a rare case of avian flu crossing over to a human in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Segment 48 (ID: seg_v5_19_1007_chunk0)\nThese infections [human infections] are concerning for non-health-related reasons, however, especially if more poultry operations in the country are found to be affected.\n\n### Segment 49 (ID: seg_v5_11_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this month, a strain of avian flu was confirmed at a commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana.\n\n### Segment 50 (ID: seg_v5_11_1009_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 51 (ID: seg_v5_13_1009_chunk0)\nIn a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 52 (ID: seg_v5_16_1009_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 53 (ID: seg_v5_3_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this week, the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed the presence of bird flu in Kentucky and Virginia, reigniting fears of another widespread bird flu outbreak.\n\n### Segment 54 (ID: seg_v5_4_1008_chunk0)\nBird flu can cause high mortality rates among birds.\n\n### Segment 55 (ID: seg_v5_6_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA said it detected the presence of the virus in an undisclosed number of birds from a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 56 (ID: seg_v5_8_1008_chunk0)\nTyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 57 (ID: seg_v5_9_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA is awaiting results of a potential second case about 124 miles northeast in Webster County, Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 58 (ID: seg_v5_10_1008_chunk0)\nMeanwhile, a backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also tested positive for the virus.\n\n### Segment 59 (ID: seg_v5_1_1009_chunk0)\nA \"highly pathogenic\" form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\n### Segment 60 (ID: seg_v5_2_1009_chunk0)\nThe virus was detected in a small, non-commercial backyard block that was not being used for poultry purposes, the agency [USDA] said.\n\n### Segment 61 (ID: seg_v5_10_1009_chunk0)\nIt [the detection in New York] came after the virus was discovered in flocks of birds in Kentucky, Virginia, and Indiana.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_2_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_9_1000_chunk0)\nAuthorities believe wild birds have been spreading the virus, after dozens recently tested positive for the flu along the East Coast, Reuters reported.\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_22_101_chunk0)\nCan I expect to pay more for poultry products?\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_25_101_chunk0)\nIf infections course through more flocks, experts said, there could be some shortages of eggs.\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_29_101_chunk0)\nThe samples are sent to diagnostic labs to be analyzed.\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_30_101_chunk0)\nOutbreaks have been detected in more than a dozen states.\n\n### Segment 68 (ID: seg_v5_31_101_chunk0)\nAs of March 31, the highly pathogenic form of the avian flu had been detected in 19 states, a tracking page maintained by the U.S.D.A. showed.\n\n### Segment 69 (ID: seg_v5_32_101_chunk0)\nThe combined number of birds in the infected flocks -- the commercial and backyard type -- totaled more than 17 million, according to the agency.\n\n### Segment 70 (ID: seg_v5_34_101_chunk0)\nAn commercial egg production facility in Buena Vista County, Iowa, constituted the largest infected flock and was made up of more than 5.3 million chickens, the U.S.D.A. said.\n\n### Segment 71 (ID: seg_v5_35_101_chunk0)\nA producer of eggs in Jefferson County, Wis., was next on the list, with more than 2.7 million chickens.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_36_101_chunk0)\nA commercial poultry flock in New Castle County, Del., was the third-largest infected flock, with more than 1.1 million chickens.\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_37_101_chunk0)\nHow do these outbreaks compare to previous ones?\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_39_101_chunk0)\nNearly 50 million birds died, either from the virus or from having to be culled, a majority of them in Iowa or Minnesota.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_40_101_chunk0)\nThe footprint of the current outbreak, extending from the Midwest and Plains to northern New England, has raised concerns.\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_1_101_chunk0)\nMore than 15 million chickens and turkeys from infected commercial and backyard flocks in 19 states have been killed, officials said.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_3_101_chunk0)\nIowa has been particularly hard hit, with disasters being declared in some counties and the state canceling live bird exhibits in an order that may affect its famed state fair.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_5_101_chunk0)\nIt [Avian influenza] spreads via nasal secretions, saliva and fecal droppings, which experts say makes it [spread] difficult to contain.\n\n### Segment 79 (ID: seg_v5_6_101_chunk0)\nSymptoms of the virus include a sudden increase in the mortality of a flock, a drop in egg production and diminished consumption of feed and water.\n\n### Segment 80 (ID: seg_v5_7_101_chunk0)\nThe virus, Eurasian H5N1, is closely related to an Asian strain that has infected hundreds of people since 2003, mostly those who had worked with infected poultry.\n\n### Segment 81 (ID: seg_v5_8_101_chunk0)\nIts prevalence in the United States is not unexpected, with outbreaks previously reported in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.\n\n### Segment 82 (ID: seg_v5_9_101_chunk0)\nShould humans be worried about being infected?\n\n### Segment 83 (ID: seg_v5_014_1010_chunk0)\nHowever, depending on the eventual scale of the outbreak [of H5N1] and subsequent euthanizations, it [the situation] could nonetheless impose a burden on consumers' wallets, adding to the already-onerous costs of poultry.\n\n### Segment 84 (ID: seg_v5_015_1010_chunk0)\nNonetheless, several countries such as Mexico have halted imports of American poultry in response to the outbreak [of H5N1].\n\n### Segment 85 (ID: seg_v5_41_101_chunk0)\nI think we're certainly seeing more geographic spread than what we saw with 2014-2015,' said Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\n### Segment 86 (ID: seg_v5_42_101_chunk0)\nWhat can be done to stop the spread of the virus?\n\n### Segment 87 (ID: seg_v5_45_101_chunk0)\nSharing of farm equipment, experts say, can contribute to spreading the virus.\n\n### Segment 88 (ID: seg_v5_46_101_chunk0)\nSo can farm workers having contact with wild birds, including when hunting.\n\n### Segment 89 (ID: seg_v5_49_101_chunk0)\nIs it necessary to kill millions of chickens and turkeys?\n\n### Segment 90 (ID: seg_v5_50_101_chunk0)\nInfected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes and twisting of the head and neck, according to the U.S.D.A.\n\n### Segment 91 (ID: seg_v5_001_1010_chunk0)\nCases of H5N1 avian influenza have been detected in Indiana, Virginia, and Kentucky,

  "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segments for Dominant Framing using Q11**\n\nMy task was to apply Q11 of the decision tree to a set of 91 text segments. This involved identifying segments with dominant alarmist or reassuring framing provided by direct quotations. I used the specified rules, including the fast-exit guard for segments without quotes and the technical-term override. I analyzed each segment individually.\n\nHere's the JSON array of results:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_1_1_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_4_1_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_013_1003_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_16_1002_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_2_100_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_3_100_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_002_1003_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_003_1003_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_004_1003_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_010_1003_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_12_1000_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_1_1002_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_2_1002_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_6_1002_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_8_1002_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_12_1005_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_13_1005_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_20_1005_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"Quote \\\"fully prepared to handle this detection\\\" lacks explicit safety link, treated as Neutral.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_2_1001_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_7_1001_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_10_1001_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_3_10_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_5_10_chunk0\", \"Q11\": \"no\", \"rationale\": \"No quotation marks present.\"},\n  {\"segment\": \"seg_v5_2"
