We’ve seen very few cases in humans since then [mid-2015/2016]. And part of that [the reason for very few human cases] is that the virus has changed—it [the virus]’s mutated to the point of where it is infecting other mammalian species and birds at an increasing rate. But we’ve had no evidence yet that [the change/mutation allowing infection of mammals/birds]’s happened for humans or for pigs."
