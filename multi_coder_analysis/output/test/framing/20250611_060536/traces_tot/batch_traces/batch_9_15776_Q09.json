in U.S. chicken meat export is partially due to the downturn in exports of chicken meat from the European Union which was caused by avian flu.\n\n### Segment 45 (ID: seg_v5_26_1007_chunk0)\nThe site currently lists three cases in commercial birds during the current outbreak.\n\n### Segment 46 (ID: seg_v5_27_1007_chunk0)\nThis [list of cases] includes commercial turkeys, a mixed-species backyard

found in a backyard flock in Virginia.\n\n### Segment 50 (ID: seg_v5_3_1006_chunk0)\nLast week, the presence of HPAI was found in a commercial turkey flock of 30,000 in Dubois County, Indiana.\n\n### Segment 51 (ID: seg_v5_4_1006_chunk0)\nIf the disease spreads to enough farms in a geographic region, it could impact the production of chicken, turkey and eggs, raising consumer prices and impacting exports.\n\n### Segment 52 (ID: seg_v5_6_1006_chunk0)\nIn 2015, a bird flu outbreak in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and South Dakota impacted the production of table eggs and turkey meat.\n\n### Segment 53 (ID: seg_v5_7_1006_chunk0)\nThough broiler chickens weren't heavily infected, exports dropped by $1.1 billion, or 26%.\n\n### Segment 54 (ID: seg_v5_8_1006_chunk0)\nEgg exports

seg_v5_5_1007_chunk0)\nA spokesperson for Tyson Foods told Newsweek one barn among a flock of 240,000 in Kentucky had chickens that tested positive for bird flu.\n\n### Segment 59 (ID: seg_v5_7_1007_chunk0)\nAlthough the origin of the infection is not known, avian influenza has been found in migratory wild birds, which play a significant role in spreading the disease.'\n\n### Segment 60 (ID: seg_v5_9_1007_chunk0)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 700 cases of bird flu in humans have been recorded globally since November 2003.\n\n### Segment 61 (ID: seg_v5_10_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC says that though bird flu can cross species and infect humans, this cross-transmission [bird flu crossing species and infecting humans] is rare.\n\n### Segment 62 (ID: seg_v5_11_1007_chunk0)\nInfection usually occurs as a result of infected birds shedding avian virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces which then gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled.\n\n### Segment 63 (ID: seg_v5_12_1007_chunk0)\nThe CDC adds that this [infection via shedding/contact] can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or even possibly dust and a person breathes it [the virus] in, or when a person touches something that has the virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.\n\n### Segment 64 (ID: seg_v5_13_1007_chunk0)\nCross infection also usually occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses.\n\n### Segment 65 (ID: seg_v5_14_1007_chunk0)\nBut, the CDC reports some infections have been identified where direct contact was not known to have occurred.\n\n### Segment 66 (ID: seg_v5_15_1007_chunk0)\nWhen a person is infected with avian flu the resultant illness ranges from mild to severe.\n\n### Segment 67 (ID: seg_v5_16_1007_chunk0)\nIn January, Newsweek reported on a rare case of avian flu crossing over to a human in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Segment 68 (ID: seg_v5_19_1007_chunk0)\nThese infections [human infections] are concerning for non-health-related reasons, however, especially if more poultry operations in the country are found to be affected.\n\n### Segment 69 (ID: seg_v5_20_1007_chunk0)\nAccording to the USDA, the U.S. is the world's top producer of poultry, and number two in terms of exports, following the top exporter Brazil.\n\n### Segment 70 (ID: seg_v5_11_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this month, a strain of avian flu was confirmed at a commercial turkey farm in southern Indiana.\n\n### Segment 71 (ID: seg_v5_11_1009_chunk0)\nThe broiler chickens in Fulton County, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials told Reuters.\n\n### Segment 72 (ID: seg_v5_13_1009_chunk0)\nIn a statement released last week, Tyson Foods confirmed that its birds were infected in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 73 (ID: seg_v5_14_1009_chunk0)\nHuman infections do occur after close contact with an infected animal, but they're considered rare, CDC officials have previously said.\n\n### Segment 74 (ID: seg_v5_16_1009_chunk0)\nThe first bird flu viruses are believed to have emerged in southern China before leading to large outbreaks in the late 1990s, according to the CDC, before the virus variants spread throughout the world.\n\n### Segment 75 (ID: seg_v5_3_1008_chunk0)\nEarlier this week, the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed the presence of bird flu in Kentucky and Virginia, reigniting fears of another widespread bird flu outbreak.\n\n### Segment 76 (ID: seg_v5_4_1008_chunk0)\nBird flu can cause high mortality rates among birds.\n\n### Segment 77 (ID: seg_v5_5_1008_chunk0)\nIn 2015, 50 million birds across 15 states were killed due to an outbreak, costing the federal government nearly $1 billion.\n\n### Segment 78 (ID: seg_v5_6_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA said it detected the presence of the virus in an undisclosed number of birds from a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County.\n\n### Segment 79 (ID: seg_v5_8_1008_chunk0)\nTyson Foods would not disclose the size of the flock in Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 80 (ID: seg_v5_9_1008_chunk0)\nThe USDA is awaiting results of a potential second case about 124 miles northeast in Webster County, Kentucky.\n\n### Segment 81 (ID: seg_v5_10_1008_chunk0)\nMeanwhile, a backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia also tested positive for the virus.\n\n### Segment 82 (ID: seg_v5_1_1009_chunk0)\nA \"highly pathogenic\" form of bird flu was detected in a backyard flock of chickens in Suffolk County, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\n### Segment 83 (ID: seg_v5_2_1009_chunk0)\nThe virus was detected in a small, non-commercial backyard block that was not being used for poultry purposes, the agency [USDA] said.\n\n### Segment 84 (ID: seg_v5_10_1009_chunk0)\nIt [the detection in New York] came after the virus was discovered in flocks of birds in Kentucky, Virginia, and Indiana.\n\n### Segment 85 (ID: seg_v5_2_1000_chunk0)\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the cases were found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, and in a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia.\n\n\n#

  "thoughts": "**Summary of Q9 Application on Text Segments**\n\nAlright, let's break down how I tackled this. My primary focus was to identify segments that **primarily** reported prices, economic data, or numerical metrics related to the poultry industry, using neutral language and avoiding vivid verbs, risk adjectives, or explicit framing.\n\nHere's my thought process for each segment:\n\n1.  **Understanding the task:** I knew I needed to flag segments reporting economic aspects.\n2.  **Initial Scan:** I quickly scanned each segment for keywords like prices, costs, percentages, rankings, exports, imports, production, and any related numerical data.\n3.  **Language Check:** For segments with potential economic data, I then looked at the language used. Did it use standard verbs like \"rose,\" \"fell,\" \"increased,\" or \"decreased,\" and neutral adverbs? Or did it veer into more evocative language (e.g., \"skyrocketed,\" \"devastating\") or risk adjectives?\n4.  **Framing Check:** I assessed if the segment was neutrally reporting facts or if it was explicitly framing the information in a way that would trigger Q9.\n5.  **Classification & Reasoning:** Based on these checks, I categorized each segment as \"Yes\" (meets the criteria) or \"No\" (doesn't meet the criteria). For \"Yes\" answers, I constructed a concise rationale (maximum 80 tokens) that quoted the key phrase(s) from the segment supporting my decision.\n\nThe result is a JSON array of objects, with each object providing the `segment_id`, `answer` (Yes/No), and a supporting `rationale` to justify my conclusions.\n"
