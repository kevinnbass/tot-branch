{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Claim Framing: Q1**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. I need to assess this text segment against Q1 of the 12-step decision tree for claim framing. Q1 focuses on identifying intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly modifying risk-adjectives. The specific pattern I'm looking for includes examples like \"so deadly,\" \"very dangerous,\" or \"more lethal.\"\n\nFirst, I carefully read the segment: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" Now, I'll go through it systematically.\n\nI'm scanning for intensifiers or comparatives followed by those specific risk-adjectives: \"deadly,\" \"lethal,\" \"dangerous,\" \"severe,\" \"catastrophic,\" \"brutal,\" \"contagious,\" \"virulent,\" or \"destructive.\"\n\nI see \"more restrictions.\" \"More\" is a comparative adjective, but the word it modifies, \"restrictions,\" is not on the list of risk-adjectives. It describes an *action* or *consequence*, not the inherent dangerousness of the threat itself.\n\nTherefore, the pattern isn't present. My conclusion is straightforward: Q1 doesn't apply here. I'll format my answer in JSON, as instructed.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses moderate verbs ('triggered', 'blocking') and lacks high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or the 'on high alert' phrase required for Q2.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment for Q2**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this text segment: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" My task is to analyze it against Q2 of the decision tree. Q2 is looking for specific linguistic cues – high-potency verbs, impactful metaphors, superlatives paired with negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert\" near a threat word.\n\nLet's break this down. First, \"Infections\" is a pretty neutral noun. Not a red flag. Then, \"triggered\" and \"blocking.\" I've got a mental checklist of high-impact verbs, and neither of these make the cut. They're definitely verbs, but they don't have the punch we're looking for.\n\nI'm scanning for those potent metaphors, those superlatives screaming danger, and that \"on high alert\" phrase – none of it is here.  So, based on my analysis, the answer to Q2 is clearly \"no.\" There's nothing in this segment that meets the criteria. On to the next question, I suppose.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified 'moderate verbs' paired with scale/impact information.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Decision Tree Evaluation: My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I've been given a text segment to analyze: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" My task is to evaluate this against the Q3 criteria from that decision tree. I understand Q3 is looking for a moderate verb coupled with some significant scale or impact.\n\nFirst, I identified the segment and started looking for those moderate verbs, using the approved list and regex as my guide. I see \"triggered\" and \"blocking\" in the text. I need to check if those verbs are on the approved list.  \"Triggered\" isn't. Neither is \"blocking.\"\n\nNext, I look for impact or scale.  I see \"more restrictions\" and \"blocking poultry.\" That's clearly significant impact; however, it's connected to those non-qualifying verbs.\n\nUltimately, the rule for Q3 requires that specific type of verb AND impact. Because the correct verb isn't there, I have to conclude that Q3 *doesn't* fire. The answer is \"no\".\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no questions, therefore it cannot contain a loaded rhetorical question.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Loaded Rhetorical Questions**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" My task is to evaluate it against Q4, specifically looking for loaded rhetorical questions that try to manufacture alarm or fear.\n\nFirst, I need to remind myself of Q4's criteria. It's all about questions deliberately designed to alarm or create a sense of urgency. Think \"Should we be worried?\" or \"Is this a disaster in the making?\" That's what I'm looking for. Neutral, information-seeking questions are out.\n\nNow, let's go back to the text. I reread it, focusing on whether it contains any questions at all. Nope. It's a straightforward statement of facts: infections, restrictions, and a trade action. No questions, rhetorical or otherwise.\n\nSince there are no questions, Q4 simply doesn't apply. I can definitively answer \"no\" to Q4. The rationale is clear: the text segment does not contain any questions, and therefore, cannot contain a loaded rhetorical question designed to instill fear or urgency. Simple as that.\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports negative facts (infections, restrictions, blocking exports) and contains no explicit language from the author or a source that signals current safety, control, or minimized risk.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Calming Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" And I need to assess it against question Q5 of the decision tree. Q5 is looking for explicit calming cues – signals of safety, control, or significantly reduced risk. I'm thinking, \"Let's see, what specifically does Q5 consider calming?\"\n\nFirst, I need to look for direct assurances of safety – phrases like \"no cause for alarm,\" \"completely safe,\" or \"fully under control.\"  Then, I'm checking for confidence statements: \"we are confident,\" \"rest assured,\" \"situation contained,\" or something like that. Also, I'm watching for official sources providing reassuring preparedness cues, maybe something like, \"we are fully prepared to handle this situation, and public safety is our priority.\" Low-risk evaluations, particularly with intensifiers – like \"the risk is *very* low\" – would also be a potential calming cue. And of course, positive amplification, like \"excellent news\" or \"very well protected.\"\n\nNow, looking at the segment, I'm seeing a description of negative events: infections, export restrictions, and a trade block. This screams \"problem\" and I'm not seeing any language that even hints at safety or control. There's nothing about how well things are being managed, no assurances that everything is okay, and no attempt to downplay the situation's risk.\n\nSo, according to my analysis, there are no explicit calming cues present in this text. Therefore, my answer to Q5 has to be \"no\". And my rationale is straightforward: the text describes a negative situation and lacks any of the specific language or phrases that Q5 is looking for to signal reassurance.\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser (e.g., 'only', 'just') combined with an explicit scale contrast (e.g., 'out of thousands').", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Q6 Rejection**\n\nOkay, so I've been given a text segment: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" My task is to assess this against Q6, specifically looking for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern used for reassurance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what I'm looking for. Q6 demands the presence of both a *minimiser* (like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely\") AND a *scale contrast* (like \"out of thousands,\" \"among millions\"). These two elements, working together, would downplay the significance of the event.\n\nI'll start by carefully dissecting the segment. I'll read it closely, looking for those specific minimiser words. Nothing. Then I'll check for any phrases suggesting a scale contrast. Again, I find nothing.\n\nBased on this analysis, the segment doesn't contain the elements required by Q6. It's missing both the minimiser and the scale contrast. Therefore, my assessment is straightforward: the answer to Q6 is \"no\".\n\nTo justify this conclusion, I'd explain that the segment fails to meet the specified criteria. It lacks both the downplaying minimiser and the contrastive scale that would be necessary to constitute the Q6 pattern. The event is stated plainly, without any attempt to minimize its impact through the identified rhetorical devices.\n"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any bare negation or explicit calming cue.", "thoughts": "**Q7 Analysis: A Critical Evaluation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and tasked with evaluating it against Question 7 of our decision tree. My focus here is on identifying \"bare negation\" - that is, statements that deny or downplay a negative fact or risk without explicitly trying to calm the audience. I know a 'bare negation' would be something like, \"not expected to be an issue\" or \"no problems reported\". If I spot a bare negation *alongside* an explicit calming cue, like \"so don't worry,\" then Q7 is a \"no,\" because it's not a bare negation *without* a calming cue. If it's a bare negation *without* a calming cue, then it's a \"yes\", and we categorize the frame as \"Neutral\". If there's neither a bare negation nor a calming cue, it's a \"no\", and I move on to Q8.\n\nNow, let's look at the segment: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\"\n\nOkay, let's break it down. \"Infections in the chickens...\" - factual, no negation there. \"...triggered more restrictions...\" - also a statement of fact, a consequence. \"...with China blocking poultry products...\" - again, a straightforward description of an action.\n\nHmm. There's no language denying or downplaying a risk using words like \"not,\" \"no,\" \"unlikely,\" or any similar term. It's just stating what happened. This clearly means there's no bare negation present.\n\nSince there's no bare negation, it follows that there can't be a bare negation without an explicit calming cue. So, the answer to Q7 is a definitive \"no.\"  I am now free to advance to Q8 and the next step of the analysis.\n"}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a negative event (infections triggering restrictions) and its consequence (blocking exports), not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Q8 Analysis: No, This Doesn't Fit**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" and I need to determine if it fits the Q8 criteria of our decision tree for claim framing. Specifically, I'm checking if it describes capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards *without* actively connecting them to reassurance about calm, safety, or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is, \"This doesn't seem like the right type of statement.\"  It immediately struck me as a report of a negative event and its consequences – an outbreak leading to export restrictions.  I mentally ran through the Q8 checklist: *Capabilities? No.* *Preparedness? Nope.* *Hopeful future possibilities? Nah.* *Safeguards? Not here either.*\n\nThe problem is, the segment focuses on the negative, the *outcome* of an event, and not on actions being taken, plans in place, or any potential future improvements.  It doesn't talk about how officials are *handling* the situation, or what *could* be done. It's just a statement of fact about what *happened*.  I'm looking for proactive language, but all I'm seeing is reactive.\n\nThe question explicitly asks if the segment describes those elements *without* explicitly linking them to reassurance, but the thing is, it doesn't describe those elements *at all*.  Therefore, the \"without linking to calm\" part is irrelevant.  The initial condition of the question – \"Does the segment describe capabilities/preparedness...?\" – is false from the start.\n\nSo, according to the tree, I'm confident my answer is \"no\". This isn't a capability/preparedness statement. I will now proceed to Q9. However, the system needs me to generate the JSON response for this step, and my rationale will be clear: *The segment does not contain any description of capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards.* This lack of relevant framing is the key. It's a clear miss on the Q8 requirements.\n"}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports on infections and trade restrictions, not primarily prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Segment Against Framing Analysis Question 9**\n\nOkay, I'm being asked to assess this segment: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" against Q9 of the decision tree. Q9 focuses on whether the text primarily presents prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using neutral language.\n\nFirst, I need to break it down. Does this segment deal with prices, economic figures, or metrics in a straightforward manner? No, it's about infections, trade restrictions, and an export block.  While these have financial repercussions, the segment isn't presenting any numerical data or focusing on pricing.\n\nNext, I need to check for any typical descriptive verbs associated with economic reporting. Again, no. It doesn't employ that kind of standard language.\n\nNow, let's look for any vivid or potentially framing language. The phrases \"triggered more restrictions\" and \"blocking poultry products\" are present. However, given the context, they function as factual descriptions of the actions taken. The word \"restrictions\" and the verb \"blocking,\" in this context, aren't intended to be read with any framing elements.\n\nThis segment does report on a negative event (infections leading to trade restrictions), but it does so factually, not with alarmist or reassuring language.  It's simply stating what happened. Since it doesn't align with the criteria of Q9, which is the focus on prices and economic data using the expected neutral language, my answer to Q9 is \"no\". That means I'll move to the next question in the decision tree (Q10) and hold off on emitting a frame for the JSON output.\n"}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes current negative events (triggered restrictions, blocking exports) and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text Segment for Decision Tree Question Q10**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and need to assess it against Decision Tree question Q10. This question is looking for speculation about *future* relief or improvement, but specifically *without* any calming cues about the present. Got it.\n\nMy first read-through, the segment sounds pretty straightforward: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\"\n\nLet's break it down: Does it speculate about the future? No, not really. It's essentially a straightforward report of current events. We've got infections, restrictions triggered by them, and China blocking exports. These are all *negative* present-tense events, not hopeful predictions of how things *will* get better. I'm looking for language like \"potential recovery,\" \"easing of restrictions,\" or even just a hint of optimism about the future. I don't see any of that. The verbs (\"triggered,\" \"blocking\") scream present-state negative, not future-oriented positive.\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q10 is a resounding \"no.\" The segment describes the *current* negative situation, not some future resolution. The rationale should reflect that: The segment details immediate negative impacts due to infections (restrictions and blocked exports) and doesn't offer any speculation about future improvement or relief.\n"}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any direct quotations or clearly attributed statements from a source.", "thoughts": "**Assessing the Presence of a Dominant Framed Quotation**\n\nOkay, so I need to check this segment against Q11 to see if it contains a dominant framed quotation. I quickly scanned the text: \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\"  No direct quotes, no \"said,\" no \"according to.\"\n\nSince Q11 specifically targets *directly* quoted sources or clearly *attributed* statements, and I see neither, the answer has to be \"no.\"  I'm looking for evidence of someone explicitly *saying* something or a clear attribution of an opinion to a specific person or source.  It's just not there.\n\nTherefore, because Q11 is a \"no,\" the next step, based on the rules, is to move on to Q12 for further analysis.\n"}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Negative facts (infections, restrictions, blocking) are reported factually without explicit alarmist or reassuring framing cues.", "thoughts": "**Neutral Framing Analysis: A Final Check**\n\nOkay, so I'm at the final hurdle, Q12 of my 12-step process. The goal here is simple: double-check for any subtle framing cues missed in the previous eleven steps. My task is to determine if this segment, \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky,\" has *any* remaining explicit and sufficient Alarmist or Reassuring language that could sway the interpretation. If I find none, and the facts, even if negative, are presented purely factually, then it's Neutral framing.\n\nLet's break it down. I'm seeing \"Infections\" – that's a cold, hard fact, a negative event but presented without embellishment. It's not \"rampant infections\" or \"catastrophic outbreaks.\" Then there's \"triggered more restrictions.\" Again, a straightforward cause-and-effect statement. \"Triggered\" isn't a *framing* verb here; it's just describing what happened. \"More restrictions\" denotes scale, but it's not alarmist – no \"drastic,\" \"crippling,\" or \"devastating\" language. Finally, \"blocking poultry products\" is a direct and factual description of the action. No dramatic imagery or loaded metaphors like \"strangling the industry\" or \"completely shutting down.\"\n\nThe bottom line is this: while the facts are negative – infections, restrictions, blocked exports – they're presented in a purely descriptive manner. There are no explicit linguistic or rhetorical cues designed to evoke fear, urgency, or actively reassure. It's a factual statement of events. Therefore, this segment, according to my 12-step process, defaults to Neutral. Q12 validates this because there are no *remaining* explicit framing cues and the presentation is indeed purely factual.\n"}
