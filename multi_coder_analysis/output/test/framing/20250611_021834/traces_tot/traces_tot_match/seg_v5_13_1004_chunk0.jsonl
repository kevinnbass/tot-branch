{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains the risk-adjective 'deadly' but it is not modified by an intensifier or comparative adjective as required by Q1.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: A Quick Scan for Intensifiers & Risk-Adjectives**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text segment and tasked with applying the first question of the 12-step claim framing decision tree. Q1 is pretty straightforward: it's looking for the specific pattern of an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk adjective. Essentially, is there a phrase in the format `(intensifier|comparative)\\s+(risk-adjective)`?\n\nMy first step is always to get a feel for the segment. Here, the focus seems to be on the potential impact of a virus, specifically on food safety and economic concerns. Now, I'll systematically search the text.\n\nI quickly scan and find \"does not present a food safety risk\". That's a neutral phrasing, a negation, not what I'm looking for. Then, I notice \"potential of being deadly to domestic fowl\". \"Deadly\" jumps out as a clear risk-adjective, but \"potential of being\" is not an intensifier or comparative modifying it.\n\nMoving on, \"threatens to spark shortages\" doesn't quite fit. \"Threatens\" is a verb, and while \"shortages\" is a negative outcome, it's not a risk adjective. \"Further increase in prices\" is similar - \"further\" modifies \"increase,\" a metric, not a risk-adjective.\n\nAnd finally, \"amid soaring inflation\". \"Soaring\" is describing a background condition, excluded by the context guard for vivid language. While it paints a vivid picture, it's not the specific pattern I need.\n\nSo, according to the rule, and the regex pattern looking for `(intensifier|comparative)\\s+(risk-adjective)`, I cannot find the pattern in the segment. Specifically, while \"deadly\" is present, it is not preceded by an intensifier or comparative.\n\nTherefore, my answer for Q1 is \"no\".\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verbs 'threatens to spark' are not listed as high-potency verbs in Q2. 'soaring' modifies 'inflation', which is a background condition explicitly excluded by the Q2 context guard.", "thoughts": "```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"no\",\n  \"rationale\": \"My analysis focused on evaluating the provided text segment against the criteria outlined in Q2 of the decision tree. Q2 specifically looks for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \\\"on high alert\\\" (with a nearby threat word).  I examined the segment, paying close attention to verbs that frame potential negative outcomes.  While the text does describe potential negative impacts such as \\\"deadly to domestic fowl,\\\" \\\"shortages,\\\" and an \\\"increase in prices,\\\" the verbs used to describe these potential impacts ('threatens to spark') do not meet the threshold for high-potency verbs as defined by the Q2 rules and examples. 'Threatens to spark' implies a potential negative outcome, but the verb 'threatens' itself lacks the vividness and destructive intensity of high-potency verbs like 'ravaged,' 'skyrocketed,' or 'crippling' that are specifically listed in the provided definition.  Furthermore, the phrase 'amid soaring inflation' is treated as contextual and ignored for alarmist coding, following the provided rule.  Therefore, based solely on the Q2 criteria, I did not find any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other specified cues, leading me to answer 'no'.\"\n}\n```"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'threatens to spark' which is a future/hypothetical verb, not denoting realised impact. 'Soaring' describes background inflation, not the virus's direct impact on cases/deaths/culling.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Decision: No**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to see if this text segment triggers the \"Alarmist\" flag in Q3 of our decision tree. That means I need to look for a 'moderate verb' paired with information about 'significant scale or impact.'\n\nFirst, I identified the text: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\"\n\nNow, to Q3. The key here is the 'moderate verb'. I scanned for the specific examples we've identified, things like *hit, swept, surged, plummeted,* etc. The segment contains \"threatens to spark\", \"increase\", and \"soaring\".\n\n\"Threatens to spark\" jumps out, but the rule states *present/future/plan* verbs get booted to Q8 or Q10 – they don't count for Q3. We're looking for *realized* impact, and \"threatens\" is hypothetical. It doesn't signal actual harm.\n\n\"Increase\" is present, but it's pretty neutral. It's not one of our predefined 'moderate' verbs. \"Soaring\" is an interesting case because it is listed as an example, but when applied to a background condition, such as \"soaring inflation,\" it doesn't trigger our alarm bells. It's like using vivid language to describe the context, not the direct impact of the virus.\n\nI did note the phrase \"a further increase in prices\", but \"increase\" itself isn't one of our key verbs. So, even though we have *potential* scale or impact, it's not paired with the type of verb Q3 is looking for. The *realized* impact of the virus on *cases, deaths, culling* is absent.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the verbs meet the very specific Q3 criteria. I'm seeing potential impact and descriptive background, but not *realized impact* linked to a 'moderate verb.' Thus, the answer is \"no\".\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Text's Rhetorical Devices**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this text segment and need to assess it against the criteria for Q4: Does it contain a loaded rhetorical question designed to instill alarm? My approach here is pretty straightforward. First, I need to understand what constitutes a \"loaded\" rhetorical question – one that implies a specific answer, often fear-mongering.\n\nI started by reading the text carefully.  It's primarily a declarative statement about a virus and its potential effects on the food supply.  I then meticulously searched for any signs of questions – actual question marks or phrasings that function rhetorically.  I was specifically looking for anything designed to implicitly alarm the reader.\n\nMy evaluation was quick. There are no questions in this segment, loaded or otherwise. While it *does* describe some concerning scenarios – the virus being deadly to fowl, potential shortages, and further price increases – it's presented as factual information.  There is no attempt to frame these issues through a question designed to manipulate the reader's emotions.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that this segment doesn't meet the criteria of Q4. The answer is clearly \"no.\" I'm confident in this assessment.  It's just a straightforward statement of potential risks.\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'does not present a food safety risk' states a conditional positive fact but lacks explicit calming language or intensified low-risk framing required for Q5.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question 5**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess this segment: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\"  My task is to determine if this includes explicit calming cues, the kind that reassure us about safety, control, or minimized risk, per Question 5 of the decision tree.\n\nI'm looking for specific phrases, you know, things that clearly signal \"no need to worry,\" like \"rest assured,\" \"completely safe,\" \"fully under control,\" or intensified low-risk statements.  I'm also on the lookout for positive amplifications or qualified preparedness cues.\n\nLet's dissect this. The initial part, \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked,\" does state a positive fact. *It's true*, and I see its value in communicating a specific mitigation strategy. However, the decision tree and my experience with risk communication tell me that bare positive facts, *on their own*, are usually categorized as *neutral*.  Unless they are accompanied by explicit calming language or intensified risk evaluations, they don't meet the criteria. The Q5 examples and exclusion criteria help a lot here, the examples provide good context around what *is* a calming cue.\n\nThe phrase \"does not present a food safety risk\" is essentially a negation followed by a conditional positive. It's a statement about a specific, controllable condition. It's not the same as saying \"no cause for alarm\" or \"we're confident\". It doesn't employ any of the explicit reassuring language the decision tree is looking for. It's merely stating a fact about a specific safety measure.\n\nThe remainder of the segment highlights potential negative consequences: disease in poultry, shortages, price hikes. It's clear that the writer is emphasizing the *negative* potential.\n\nTherefore, according to my understanding of Q5 and the nuances of calming cues, the phrase \"does not present a food safety risk\" does not qualify as an *explicit calming cue*. My assessment is \"no\". The rationale boils down to this: while it's a positive statement, it lacks the necessary explicit reassuring language and context required by Q5.\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text does not contain the required 'minimiser + scale contrast' pattern (e.g., 'only one out of thousands') to trigger Q6.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: No Q6 Presence**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and I'm being asked to apply Question 6 from the decision tree. My brain automatically jumps to what Q6 is all about: identifying a \"minimiser\" coupled with a \"scale contrast\" to paint a reassuring picture, right? That's the core of it.\n\nFirst, I dissect the text: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\"  Nothing too complex there, but let's see if Q6 applies.\n\nI'm mentally running through the checklist. I'm actively looking for those key indicators: a \"minimiser\" – something like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely\" – and a \"scale contrast\" that provides context, such as \"out of thousands\" or \"nationwide.\"  My internal search engine kicks in.\n\nI re-read the text.  Nope.  No \"only,\" no \"just.\"  And definitely no explicit contrasting scales. It's just stating facts. It's a clear statement about food safety (assuming proper cooking) and the impact on poultry supply and prices.\n\nTherefore,  Since I can't find BOTH a minimiser AND a scale contrast, my answer to Q6 is a resounding \"no.\"  The required pattern just isn't there. No downplaying is happening here.\n"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'does not present a food safety risk' is a bare negation without an explicit calming cue.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment Regarding Bare Negation**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with determining whether this text snippet contains a \"bare negation\" without an explicit calming cue, specifically in the context of Question 7. Let's see...\n\nI've examined the segment: \"The virus also does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked, but it has the potential of being deadly to domestic fowl and threatens to spark shortages of chicken, turkey and eggs along with a further increase in prices for such items amid soaring inflation.\"\n\nRight away, I see the negation \"does not present a food safety risk.\" Now, I need to check for any explicit calming cues that might follow this.  The phrase \"as long as food is properly cooked\" is a *condition*, not a calming cue like \"there's nothing to worry about\" or \"consumers can relax.\"\n\nThinking about Q7, this clearly is a 'Risk Negation' situation.  The rule states these are Neutral if there's no explicit calming cue. Since I'm not seeing any soothing language after \"does not present a food safety risk,\" I have to conclude that Q7 is \"Yes.\"  The lack of an explicit calming cue means we can't infer reassurances.\n\nTherefore, the frame is Neutral.\n\nHere's the JSON output I'd construct:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The phrase \\\"does not present a food safety risk\\\" constitutes a 'Risk Negation' as defined by Q7. Since it is not followed by an explicit calming cue, the answer to Q7 is 'yes'.\"\n}\n```\n"}
