{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Q1 Analysis: A Quick Scan**\n\nAlright, let's dissect this text segment to see if it triggers Q1 of our claim-framing decision tree. The user wants me to identify any instance where an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifies a risk-adjective.\n\nI'm focusing on the core pattern: `(intensifier/comparative) + (risk-adjective)`.  I've got my mental checklist of risk-adjectives: things like \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" \"contagious.\" I'm also armed with the list of intensifiers and comparatives: \"very,\" \"more,\" \"severely,\" etc.\n\nNow, let's run the segment \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\" through my pattern filter. \"Spreading\" and \"positive\" are adjectives, but \"spreading\" is not a risk-adjective.  \"Positive\" is descriptive of a test result and not a direct risk-adjective. I'm not seeing any of those intensifiers or comparatives either.  No \"very dangerous,\" no \"more contagious,\" nothing that fits the bill.  The idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\" doesn't appear either.\n\nTherefore, the text segment *doesn't* contain the `(intensifier/comparative) + (risk-adjective)` pattern.  The answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" My rationale? The necessary components of the pattern simply aren't present.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses moderate verbs ('spreading', 'tested positive') and lacks high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 cues.", "thoughts": "**Q2 Analysis: A Negative Conclusion**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with analyzing this text segment, *\"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast,\"* against Q2 of the decision tree. My job is to see if it triggers any of the \"red flags\" that indicate a heightened state of alarm. Specifically, I'm looking for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative noun combinations, or the \"on high alert\" phrase, often linked to an imminent threat.\n\nRight off the bat, I scan for those telltale signs. Are there any *ravaged* or *devastated* verbs? Nope. No *ticking time bombs* or *nightmare scenarios* lurking in the prose. No \"worst crises\" or \"most expensive disasters\" either. And definitely no \"on high alert\" with a threatening word nearby.\n\nNow, I zero in on the verbs. We have \"spreading\" and \"tested positive.\" \"Spreading\" feels moderate to me, not a *high-potency* verb. And \"tested positive,\" while significant in the context, is a factual description, not a vivid metaphor designed to instill fear. It's a key observation, but it's not a hyperbolic descriptor. The fact that the text indicates \"dozens tested positive\" is important, but the boundary guard for moderate verbs and scales is Q3, not Q2.\n\nQ2 is very specific; it is looking for the big, bold signals. The verbs here just don't pack that punch. \"Spreading\" might signal something worth keeping an eye on, but it doesn't cross the threshold to signal alarm in Q2. Therefore, based on the absence of those specific Q2 indicators, the answer is a clear \"no.\" It's on to Q3!\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'spreading' and 'tested positive', neither of which are on the list of moderate verbs for Q3. The scale 'dozens' is not considered significant impact per Q3 examples.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Against Q3 Criteria**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\"  My task is to determine if this aligns with Q3 of the decision tree, which asks if there's a \"moderate verb\" combined with information detailing \"significant scale or impact.\"\n\nFirst, I need to pinpoint those \"moderate verbs.\"  My regex list provides the criteria: `hit, swept, surged, soared, plunged, plummeted, prompted, feared, fearing, (?:were|was)\\s+culled`.  Neither \"spreading\" nor \"tested positive\" are in that list.  So, right away, the answer might be \"no.\"\n\nNext, I need to evaluate for \"significant scale or impact.\" The text mentions \"dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\" \"Dozens\" indicates a quantity, but does it meet the \"significant\" threshold defined by the examples in Q3? Thinking about the examples given, such as \"millions culled,\" \"record losses,\" or \"thousands affected,\" \"dozens\" seems quite small by comparison. The \"U.S. East Coast\" aspect indicates geographic spread, but the *impact* relates to \"dozens,\" which doesn't seem to indicate the kind of profound impact we're looking for.\n\nEven if I were to stretch the definitions, neither \"spreading\" nor \"tested positive\" are moderate verbs, and the associated scale \"dozens\" is insufficient.  Considering all of this, the answer has to be \"no.\"  The criteria for Q3 aren't satisfied.\n"}

My process is pretty straightforward here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the segment itself. It's stating that wild birds are *thought* to be spreading a virus, based on some positive test results. Next, I need to remind myself what Q4 is explicitly looking for: a rhetorical question with a loaded implication of fear or worry. Does the segment contain a question? Absolutely not. It's a plain, declarative sentence. There's no attempt to subtly manipulate the reader's emotions through a question. It just states a perceived fact, albeit one with potentially serious implications.\n\nGiven this, there's no way this segment meets the criteria of a loaded rhetorical question. My conclusion is a firm \"no.\" I'll format my response accordingly in JSON.\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports factual information about wild birds spreading the virus and testing positive, but contains no explicit calming language or cues for reassurance.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\"  My task is to evaluate this against Question 5 of the decision tree. Q5 is specifically looking for explicit calming cues – those phrases that reassure the public about safety, control, or minimized risk.\n\nI need to meticulously check for direct safety assurances like \"no cause for alarm,\" confidence statements such as \"we are confident,\" preparedness cues from officials tied to public safety, intensified low-risk evaluations (\"very low\"), or positive amplifications like \"excellent news.\"  I have a checklist of these types of phrases, and I need to look for patterns matching these.\n\nReading the segment, it's a straightforward reporting of a potential risk: wild birds are possibly spreading a virus, with positive test results. There's nothing in the language that provides any reassurance. No one's telling the public to relax, that everything is under control, or the risk is minimal.  It’s simply a statement of fact.\n\nTherefore, applying my expertise and comparing the text directly against the Q5 criteria, it's clear the answer is \"no.\" This is a purely factual report without any of the calming language that I'm specifically looking for.\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'dozens tested positive' but lacks both a specific minimiser token (like 'only', 'just', 'few') and an explicit scale contrast ('out of X').", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Question 6**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and need to determine if it aligns with Question 6 of the decision tree. That means I have to look for a specific pattern: a \"minimizer\" paired with a contrasting scale.  The provided examples of minimizers are \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" and \"few.\"  I'm searching for this kind of framing to be used reassuringly.\n\nI'm starting by breaking down the text. First up: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus...\" This sentence on its own doesn't contain a minimizer or a clear contrasting scale.\n\nNext, I look at the sentence: \"...after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\"  My initial focus is on \"dozens.\" Is \"dozens\" a minimizer?  It's certainly not a singular number, nor is it a word like \"only\" or \"few.\"  It suggests a quantity between 24 and 120. While it's not a huge number, it's not explicitly framed as small. Based on the rules, \"dozens\" doesn't fit the definition of a minimizer.\n\nThen, there's \"along the U.S. East Coast.\" This gives a location, but it doesn't offer a comparative scale. I'd need to see something like \"dozens out of thousands\" or \"among millions\" to indicate a relevant contrasting scale.  It's just not there.\n\nUltimately, although \"dozens\" might imply a smaller number, it's not presented as a \"minimizer\" as defined. And crucially, there is no explicit contrasting scale. So, my conclusion has to be \"no\" for Question 6. I need to explain clearly that the text doesn't meet the criteria because it lacks both a minimizer and an explicit scale contrast.\n"}

This means I'm searching for phrases that negate or minimize the risk, like \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" or anything implying the problem isn't a concern.\n\nMy analysis reveals the text is actually *stating* a fact: wild birds are spreading the virus, evidenced by positive tests. There's no attempt to downplay or deny the risk at all. I see no phrases indicating that the virus spread *isn't* a problem. I'm not seeing any form of negation within the provided text. Therefore, Q7 isn't met.\n\nThe answer, therefore, is \"no\".

{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the spread of the virus, not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q8**\n\nOkay, so I need to assess this text segment: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\" against Question Q8 of the decision tree. Q8 is looking for any mention of capabilities, preparedness, hopeful scenarios, or safeguards, *without* a direct link to current reassurance about safety, calm, or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is that this isn't going to be a \"yes.\" I'm looking for things like \"We have the ability to...\" or \"We are prepared with...\" or even just general hopeful statements that don't immediately soothe concerns. This segment doesn't strike me as any of those.\n\nLet's break it down: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus\" - that's more of a potential *source* of the problem. \"Dozens tested positive\" - that's a factual observation, a negative one at that. There's no talk of *what* we're doing about it, or *how* we're ready for it. No capabilities, no preparedness, no future possibilities, and certainly no safeguards *without* active reassurance.\n\nI'm thinking, this segment is describing the *situation*, not our *response*. It's about a problem and a related fact. It's not a statement *about* capabilities, preparedness, or anything else Q8 is fishing for.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let me quickly review Q8 again. Yep, it's explicitly looking for statements *about* those things, and this segment simply isn't about that. It's about virus spread and positive tests. It has nothing to do with capability, preparedness, hopeful scenarios, or safeguards in an untethered way.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the answer to Q8 is definitively \"no.\" It's a simple, factual statement, not a \"Capability/Preparedness Statement without Active Reassurance.\" And I'll make sure to reflect that in my JSON output.\n"}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a count of positive tests ('dozens tested positive') but is not reporting prices, economic data, or financial metrics as defined by Q9.", "thoughts": "**Q9 Evaluation: A Quick Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text snippet, \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast,\" and running it through Q9 of the decision tree. My task is clear: does this segment primarily focus on reporting prices, economic data, or numerical metrics using the established neutral language the question describes?\n\nIn my expert opinion, absolutely not. While it does contain a numerical element (\"dozens\"), this isn't the type of metric Q9 is concerned with. We're talking about tallies, cases, and potentially epidemiological data, not the economic indicators Q9 targets – think market prices, revenues, costs, or other financial figures. Furthermore, the verbs used – \"spreading\" and \"tested positive\" – aren't the standard economic reporting verbs we'd expect in this context, like \"increased,\" \"decreased,\" or \"stabilized.\"\n\nTherefore, my answer to Q9 has to be a firm \"no.\" This segment simply doesn't align with the criteria for reporting prices or economic data in the way Q9 defines. The numerical element, while present, isn't related to the economic data that this question is interested in.\n"}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes current/past events (birds spreading, testing positive) and does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Against Question Q10**\n\nOkay, I've got the text segment: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\" My task is to assess whether this aligns with Q10 of the decision tree. Q10 is looking for speculation about future relief or improvement *without* a calming cue.\n\nLet's break it down. The text focuses on the current situation: the potential spread by birds and recent positive tests. I'm not seeing any language that hints at *future* easing of restrictions, a reduction in pressure, improvement, recovery, normalization, or any resolution of issues. There's also no explicit mention of hope for the future or timelines for potential improvement.\n\nEssentially, this segment is describing a current or past scenario. It's informative, even potentially concerning, but it's not speculating about what comes *after* this current state. Therefore, it doesn't fit the bill for Q10. My response to Q10 has to be \"no,\" and the rationale is straightforward: the segment doesn't contain any speculation about future relief or improvement.\n"}

I don't see any quotation marks, and there's no clear attribution to a specific person or source. It's a general statement about a belief.  Q11 specifically asks about a *directly quoted source* and framing.

{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Segment reports factual information (birds spreading virus, positive tests) using neutral language without explicit alarmist or reassuring cues.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: The Text is Neutral**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and trying to figure out if it's Neutral, which means I'm running it through my mental checklist for Q12 of the decision tree. Q12 is the \"default-to-neutral\" check, right? Basically, if there aren't any clear signs of Alarmist or Reassuring framing cues, then it's Neutral.\n\nLet's break it down: \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast.\"\n\nFirst, \"Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus\": It describes a *potential* risk factor – birds spreading the virus. The phrase \"thought to be spreading\" is pretty neutral; it's just reporting someone's belief or observation. It's not a strong statement, and definitely not an alarmist intensification.\n\nThen, \"after dozens tested positive\": We've got a factual count (\"dozens\") and a factual event (\"tested positive\"). \"Dozens\" is a general number, not hyped up or downplayed. \"Tested positive\" is just standard medical terminology.\n\nFinally, \"along the U.S. East Coast\": Location, plain and simple, a geographical fact.\n\nNow, checking for those framing cues: no intensifiers, no vivid verbs describing a dire impact, no exaggeration of scale, and no loaded metaphors. Also, no explicit reassuring language. Just factual reporting of a potential problem and a reported observation.\n\nThe Bedrock Principle and Symmetry Rule tell me that negative facts, when stated neutrally, result in a Neutral frame. This segment fits that perfectly.\n\nSo, according to Q12, and drawing upon my experience with similar assessments like \"reported 15 cases\" or \"detected in 3 locations,\" there are no remaining explicit and sufficient framing cues. Therefore, the frame is indeed Neutral. Q12: *Yes*.\n"}
