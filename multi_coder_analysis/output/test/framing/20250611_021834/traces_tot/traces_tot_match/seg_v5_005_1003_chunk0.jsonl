{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the phrase 'highly lethal', which is an intensifier ('highly') directly modifying a risk-adjective ('lethal'). This fits the Q1 pattern and is not excluded by the 'highly pathogenic' technical term guard.", "thoughts": "**My Decision-Making Process for Framing the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. The task is to analyze the text and determine its framing (Alarmist, Reassuring, or Neutral) using a 12-step decision tree. I'm starting at Q1 and following the rules meticulously. The output needs to be a JSON object.\n\nThe text segment is: \"They [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\"\n\nQ1 asks if the segment contains an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective. Initially, I identified \"highly lethal bird flu\".  The word \"highly\" is an intensifier, and \"lethal\" is a risk-adjective.  This combination fits the pattern outlined in Q1: \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj\".\n\nHowever, there's a \"Technical-term guard\" to consider. It states that \"highly pathogenic\" is Neutral unless further alarmist cues appear.  The phrase in the text is \"highly lethal\", which is very similar. The rule specifically mentions \"highly pathogenic (avian) influenza\".  I had to determine if \"highly lethal\" falls under that guard.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the rules and the provided regex, I concluded that \"highly lethal\" *is not* covered by the technical term guard. The regex explicitly ignores `highly` followed by `pathogenic avian flu/influenza`.  \"Highly lethal\" does *not* fall under this exclusion. Also, the rule \"Technical or Clinical Terms\" supports the conclusion that \"lethal\" *with* an intensifier is Alarmist.\n\nTherefore, since \"highly lethal\" fits the Q1 pattern and is not excluded, my answer to Q1 is \"yes\". Q1 dictates an Alarmist frame. I stop here and don't proceed to lower-numbered questions.\n\nThe decisive cue I will include in the rationale is: \"highly lethal\".\n\nI have double-checked the steps to confirm adherence.\n"}
