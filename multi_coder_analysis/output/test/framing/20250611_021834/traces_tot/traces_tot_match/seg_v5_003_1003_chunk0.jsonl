{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a factual event (limited purchases due to an outbreak) without using intensifiers or comparative adjectives to modify risk-adjectives.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text segment and instructed to evaluate it based on the first question of this decision tree. The goal of Q1, as I understand it, is to identify whether the text contains an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\"\n\nLooking at the segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there,\" I immediately start scanning for those specific patterns. My first thought is to quickly check for any words like \"so,\" \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"more,\" or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives such as \"deadly,\" \"dangerous,\" or \"severe.\"  I don't see any.  The text mentions an \"outbreak,\" which is clearly a negative event, but the description remains factual.\n\nNext, I check for the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\"  Again, no. It's not present.\n\nSince neither the intensifier/comparative pattern nor the fixed idiom is present, I'm confident in answering \"no\" to Q1. I need to proceed to the next stage of the decision tree, Q2, which I don't see yet.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('limited poultry purchases', 'outbreak') and does not contain high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for High-Potency Signals**\n\nOkay, so I need to analyze this segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" against Q2 of the decision tree. I know the drill: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlatives with negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert\" near a threat word. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, those high-potency verbs. \"Limited\" feels pretty neutral; it's a consequence, not a dramatic description of the threat's impact. \"Outbreak\" is a noun describing the event itself. Not a match there.\n\nNext, metaphors. Nope, nothing metaphorical jumping out.  \n\nThen, the superlative/negative noun combo.  No \"worst outbreaks\" or anything like that.\n\nAnd finally, the \"on high alert\" trap?  Nope, not present.\n\nSo, it's pretty clear: this is a straightforward, factual description. \"Limited\" is a moderate verb. \"Outbreak\" is a technical term. This segment doesn't contain any of the triggers for a \"yes\" answer on Q2. Therefore, my answer to Q2 is definitely \"no\".  I'll just need to provide the JSON rationale.\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the verb 'limited' and mentions 'an outbreak', neither of which are on the Q3 list of moderate verbs paired with explicit scale/impact indicators.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Decision Tree Evaluation**\n\nOkay, let me break this down. The task is to apply Q3 of the decision tree to this text segment. My expert eye immediately goes to the heart of the matter: finding those \"moderate verbs\" that signal significant impact, coupled with concrete scale or impact data.\n\nFirst, the segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" Now, let's dissect it. \"Limited\" and \"outbreak\" jump out at me as potential verbs. But, looking at the Q3 criteria, \"limited\" isn't on the list of moderate verbs like *hit, swept, surged, plummeted* and so on. Also, \"outbreak\" is a noun in this context.\n\nNext, I look for explicit scale. The segment tells me \"limited poultry purchases\" and about \"an outbreak.\" While that implies an issue, it doesn't quantify the impact. I don't see anything specific like \"millions of birds culled,\" or \"record losses,\" or \"thousands affected.\" Q3 demands that level of specificity.\n\nTherefore, the combination is missing. I'm not seeing a moderate verb *and* quantified impact. The answer to Q3 is a clear \"no\" based on the evidence.\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise.", "thoughts": "**My Assessment of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to apply Q4 of the decision tree for claim framing to this segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" My job is to see if this passage uses a loaded rhetorical question that's designed to scare the reader.\n\nI've got the criteria clear in my head: the question needs to be rhetorical, and it needs to imply some sense of alarm.  I scanned the segment carefully. It's a straightforward statement, just reporting an event.  No questions at all, let alone a rhetorical one with a scare tactic.\n\nThe answer to Q4 is definitely \"no.\" I'll structure my response as a JSON object, as requested.\n"}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (outbreak and limited purchases) but contains no explicit language from the author or a source intended to calm concerns or assure safety.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Reassuring Cues**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this text snippet and I'm being asked to determine if it aligns with Q5 of my decision tree. That means I need to sift through it looking for explicit language meant to reassure the audience about safety, control, or minimized risk. Specifically, I'm checking for phrases that clearly communicate that the situation is being managed and that there's no reason to be overly concerned.\n\nThe text reads: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nHmm. This is a pretty straightforward report of an event and its consequences. I'm focusing on the author's voice here. I'm looking for direct reassurance, statements intended to calm fears, anything signaling that everything is under control. But I'm not seeing it. No \"don't worry,\" no \"it's all good,\" no comforting language. The author is simply presenting facts – an outbreak and the resulting restrictions.\n\nSince there's no explicit calming language present, no direct attempt to reassure the audience, I'm going to have to say \"no\" to Q5. My rationale is clear: the text is a neutral report of events and does not contain any of the explicit calming cues, like those listed in the pattern recognition table or those matching the regex, that would indicate an attempt to reassure the audience about safety or control.\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser (like 'only' or 'just') combined with an explicit scale contrast ('out of thousands').", "thoughts": "**Evaluating for Reassurance: Q6 - Minimiser + Scale Contrast**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to analyze this text segment, \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there,\" against Q6, specifically looking for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern used for reassurance. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, I need to scan the text for a minimizer – words like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"merely\" that would downplay the significance of the event. I don't see any of those here.\n\nNext, I look for a scale contrast. The segment does mention \"an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm,\" but it doesn't provide any context that contrasts this with the bigger picture of the poultry industry. There's no comparison to the total number of farms, the overall volume of poultry, or anything similar that would put the outbreak in perspective.\n\nNow, according to the rule, I need *both* a minimizer *and* a scale contrast working together. Since neither element is present, the answer to Q6 is clearly \"no.\"\n\nMy rationale is simple: the segment doesn't contain the specific combination of elements (minimizer and scale contrast) required by the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern within the Q6 rule. Therefore, the pattern isn't present, and the answer is \"no.\"\n"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a consequence of an outbreak ('limited poultry purchases') rather than containing a bare negation of a risk or problem.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation of the Text Segment**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and I'm being asked to assess it against Q7 of a decision tree. Q7, as I understand it, is looking for \"bare negation\" – essentially, language that downplays a risk or problem without any mitigating context, any calming cue.\n\nThe text is: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nMy first instinct is to scan for those telltale phrases: \"not expected,\" \"unlikely,\" \"no evidence,\" \"doesn't pose a risk,\" \"will not impact,\" that kind of thing. But they aren't there. What I *do* see is a clear cause-and-effect relationship: an outbreak *caused* buyers to *limit* purchases. This is a statement of fact about a negative event (the outbreak) and its direct consequence. It's not a negation; it's a description.\n\nTherefore, this segment doesn't contain a \"bare negation\" as Q7 defines it. It's a straight-up factual statement about a negative situation. The answer to Q7, in my expert opinion, is a definitive \"no\". We need to move on to Q8. However, based on the prompt, I only need to provide the Q7 answer. The rationale behind my \"no\" is this: the text presents a direct consequence to a negative event and does not use any kind of negation that would downplay that situation, hence, Q7 is inapplicable.\n"}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a negative event (outbreak) and its consequence (limited purchases), not capabilities, preparedness, or safeguards.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Against Decision Tree Question Q8**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this text segment in relation to decision tree Question Q8. I've been asked to assess whether the text describes capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards, *without* explicitly linking them to current calm, safety, or minimized risk.\n\nMy initial thought is to break down the text: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\"\n\nThe first part, \"buyers… limited poultry purchases,\" describes a direct consequence of an event. The second part, \"due to an outbreak,\" clearly states the reason for this consequence – a negative event, the outbreak.\n\nNow, let's go down the list for Q8:\n\n*   **Capabilities?** No, this text doesn't showcase abilities. It is describing an effect, not an ability.\n*   **Preparedness measures?** No, it does not describe preparation actions.\n*   **Hopeful future possibilities?** No, it doesn't mention positive outcomes.\n*   **Implemented safeguards?** No, no security measures are described.\n\nThe segment is primarily focused on the outbreak and its immediate economic consequence. It doesn't introduce any of the content Q8 is looking for. It is describing a problem and a reaction.\n\nSince the segment doesn't contain the type of content Q8 is looking for, a \"no\" is the only logical answer. The premise of the question, that the content being analyzed must mention capabilities, preparedness, hope, or safeguards, is false for this segment. It's essentially describing the problem itself and a resulting action, not anything related to *how* that problem is being handled or future possibilities.\n\nTherefore, because this text segment lacks the characteristics detailed in Q8, I will proceed to the next question, Q9, as I can now confidently say the answer to Q8 is a \"no.\" I am confident in my analysis based on the specific nature of Q8 and the examples given.\n"}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes an action ('limited poultry purchases') rather than reporting specific economic metrics using standard verbs like 'rose' or 'fell'.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Segment Against Q9**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there,\" and I need to assess it against Q9 of this decision tree. Q9, as I understand it, is looking for factual reporting of prices or metrics, using standard verbs and neutral adverbs, and avoiding any vivid language or framing.\n\nInitially, I see that the segment *does* deal with economic activity – specifically, purchasing. However, it doesn't immediately report specific prices, costs, or losses. It's more of a description of *an action*, a restriction on trade. I need to dig deeper.\n\nLet's break it down: Are there numerical metrics being reported? Not directly. We don't have price points, volume figures, or percentage changes. It mentions \"limited poultry purchases,\" which *implies* an economic impact, but doesn't *quantify* it.\n\nNow, for the verbs. Q9 specifically wants standard verbs like \"rose\" or \"declined.\" The verb here is \"limited.\" While it relates to economic activity, it's not the kind of direct reporting verb Q9 is looking for. It's more of a description of an action. There are no vivid verbs that would raise a flag, and no risk adjectives.\n\nEssentially, while the segment *involves* economic consequences, it doesn't *explicitly report* prices or metrics using the kind of standard language Q9 defines. It's reporting *an action*, a trade restriction, rather than a quantifiable change in prices or economic indicators.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to Q9 has to be \"no.\" The segment doesn't fit the specific criteria Q9 is looking for. It's time to move on to the next question in the tree. The rationale is simply that the segment describes an action rather than reporting specific price changes or economic metrics using standard descriptive verbs.\n"}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a past event and its consequence; it does not speculate about future relief or improvement.", "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Segment Against Q10**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment and need to determine if it speculates about future relief or improvement, but without any calming cues about the present. Q10's the question we're focusing on.\n\nI read the segment: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" Hmm, it's pretty straightforward. It's describing a *past* event: the limited poultry purchases because of the outbreak. There's no hint of \"things will get better,\" \"restrictions will ease,\" \"recovery is on the horizon,\" or anything like that.\n\nI carefully reread Q10. The key here is future *speculation*. Is there any hint of potential *future* positive changes? Nope. It's all about what *happened* last week. It's factual, not forward-looking in that sense. There's no explicit mention of restrictions easing or any other signs of pressure easing.\n\nTherefore, the segment doesn't speculate about future improvement. My answer is definitely \"no\". I'll format the response accordingly in JSON.\n"}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no direct quotes or attributed statements to evaluate for dominant framing.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Dominant Frames**\n\nOkay, so I'm supposed to apply Q11 to this text. That means I'm looking for a dominant frame explicitly presented through direct quotes or attributed statements. I know how Q11 works; it's a quick way to identify the framing that's being *actively* constructed in the text. I've got to read the segment closely. \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" Hmm, let me see... nope, no direct quotes, and nothing explicitly attributed to a specific source. No \"so-and-so said...\" or anything like that.  Therefore, I have to conclude that Q11 is a \"no\" for this text segment. I will move on to the next question.\n"}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Facts (limited purchases, outbreak) are presented factually using neutral language ('limited', 'outbreak') without explicit framing cues.", "thoughts": "**Q12 Analysis and Decision:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the text: \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" My task is to determine its frame using the 12-step decision tree. I start, as instructed, at Q12, the default-to-neutral check.  My initial assessment is that this will be a neutral frame, but I have to methodically confirm that.\n\nFirst, I need to rule out any Alarmist framing. I meticulously check for intensifiers, vivid verbs depicting impact, or any explicit language signaling risk or crisis.  \"Limited\" is just an action verb; \"outbreak\" is a description of an event.  It's factual. Nothing here is amplified or dramatized.  Similarly, I check for Reassuring framing cues, like phrases of calm or explicit risk reduction, but those are absent as well.\n\nThis segment reports a straightforward series of facts: an outbreak occurred, and consequently, purchases were limited.  The language used is purely descriptive, devoid of emotional coloring.  It isn't about *how* those facts are communicated, it is about the facts. While the impact of limited purchases may be negative, the presentation *itself* is neutral.\n\nSince there are no explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues, and the presentation is purely factual, I conclude that Q12 applies. The answer is \"yes,\" it's a default neutral frame. I will state in the rationale that the facts are presented factually, with no explicit framing cues. All the constraints are met, and I have high confidence.\n```json\n{\n  \"q12\": {\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The segment presents factual information about an outbreak and its consequence (limited purchases) using neutral, descriptive language.
