{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of \"Authorities Remain on High Alert\" Against Q1**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to assess the phrase \"Authorities remain on high alert for new virus cases\" against the criteria outlined in Q1 of the decision tree. My initial assessment is that this is going to be a straightforward \"no.\"\n\nMy reasoning is this: Q1 is looking for specific linguistic features that suggest an immediate and significant risk. The focus is on modifiers of risk-related adjectives or the presence of a specific idiom. Examining the phrase, I don't see any of those things. \"High alert\" is a state of preparedness, a descriptive phrase indicating vigilance, not an intensifier modifying a risk adjective. There are no comparatives or intensifiers modifying words like \"dangerous,\" \"deadly,\" or \"severe.\" And, of course, there's no instance of the fixed idiom we're looking for.\n\nTherefore, given my analysis against the established criteria, I must answer \"no\" to this question and proceed accordingly."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The phrase 'on high alert' is a critical alert phrase that, when combined with a named threat ('virus cases'), triggers the Alarmist frame under Q2.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of \"Authorities Remain on High Alert for New Virus Cases\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the phrase \"Authorities remain on high alert for new virus cases\" and I need to run it against Q2 of my decision tree. Let's see... Q2's looking for those high-impact elements â€“ potent verbs, metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, and specifically, critical alert phrases.\n\nAha! Right away, I spot \"on high alert.\"  I know that's a pattern in Q2, specifically categorized as a \"Critical Alert Phrase.\"  But that phrase alone isn't enough; it has to be paired with a named threat. Bingo! The sentence also names the threat: \"new virus cases.\"\n\nMy decision tree dictates that \"Critical Alert Phrase\" patterns get precedence #2, so this is a crucial find. Since I've found a match for Q2, that's my stopping point. I would answer \"Yes\" to Q2, assigning the \"Alarmist\" frame, and my rationale will need to emphasize the key element: \"on high alert\"."}
