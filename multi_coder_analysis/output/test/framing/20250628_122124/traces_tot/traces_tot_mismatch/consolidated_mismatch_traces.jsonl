Q1 is all about spotting intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly modifying risk-adjectives.\n\nFirst, I break down the segment. \"Human infection is rare\" - now, \"rare\" isn't really a risk-adjective in the sense that we're looking for. It suggests *low* risk. And, importantly, there's no \"very rare,\" \"more rare,\" or anything like that modifying \"rare\" to amplify it. The second part, \"but can occur after close contact with an infected animal,\" just states a potential condition. There are no intensified risk terms there either.\n\nTherefore, because \"rare\" doesn't fit the criteria of a *risk*-adjective that's being intensified or compared, and because the rest of the segment is just stating a condition, my answer to Q1 is a clear \"no.\" My rationale will definitely point out this specific lack of the pattern we're searching for. It's a straightforward negative.\n"}, {"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('rare', 'can occur') and does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, critical alert phrases, or superlative/intensifier + negative noun combinations as defined in Q2.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.", "article_id": 1001, "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment: Assessing Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this text segment: \"Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.\" My task is to analyze this segment specifically through the lens of Q2 of the decision tree, which is designed to identify alarmist framing. Q2 is looking for specific markers: high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, critical alert phrases, or superlative/intensifier + negative noun combinations that paint a particularly alarming picture.\n\nFirst, I examined the verbs. \"Rare\" and \"occur\" are the verbs in this sentence. Neither are high-potency verbs like \"devastated,\" \"exploded,\" or \"incinerated\". They're fairly neutral in their implications.\n\nNext, I looked for any superlative + negative noun combinations, thinking specifically of phrases like \"worst outcome,\" or \"deadliest threat.\" There were no such constructions in the text.\n\nThen, I looked for any critical alert phrases that might indicate alarm, things like \"DANGER!,\" \"WARNING!,\" or \"IMMEDIATE threat.\" The text doesn't contain any of those types of phrases.\n\nFinally, I checked for potent metaphors that might be used to vividly portray the situation as more alarming than it actually is. The text uses straightforward language and does not contain any metaphors.\n\nBecause none of the patterns I was looking for in Q2 are present, I confidently conclude that the answer to Q2 is \"no.\" The language, while describing a potential risk, does so in a neutral and factual manner.\n"}, {"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with explicit scale or impact information.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "Human infection is rare but can occur after close contact with an infected animal.", "article_id": 1001, "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Segment for Scale and Impact**\n\nOkay, I'm being asked to assess this segment using the Q3 criteria from the decision tree.

I know the rules well: we're looking for things like \"very dangerous\" or \"more lethal.\" I've got my list of risk-adjectives and intensifiers/comparatives at the ready.\n\nLet's examine the segment: \"There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses...\".  Wait a minute. I'm immediately noticing \"highly pathogenic.\" But, hold on. I recall the crucial guard clause: \"Skip if it's the taxonomic phrase 'highly pathogenic (avian) influenza / HPAI'.\" And that's *exactly* what this is: a technical term describing a specific strain of flu. It's not the author trying to amp up a risk adjective; it's a formal description, a name, if you will. The \"highly\" here isn't an intensifier in the sense we're looking for.\n\nMoving on, we see the statement includes data points, such as \"resulting in 456 deaths.\" That's just raw data. While mortality is a risk factor, we're not dealing with an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective there. Itâ€™s a factual statement, not the specific pattern we're targeting.\n\nTherefore, after a careful review, the answer is a definitive \"no\". The segment, while describing a serious risk, does not contain the specified grammatical structure needed for Q1 to be true. The \"highly\" is part of a guarded technical term, and the data is just data.\n"}, {"Q": 2, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('contracting', 'resulting') to state facts about cases and deaths, without employing high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, critical alert phrases, or superlative/intensifier + negative noun combinations.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses, but worldwide, 864 people have contracted it [highly pathogenic avian flu viruses] since 2003, resulting in 456 deaths, according to the CDC and WHO.", "article_id": 1001, "thoughts": "**Evaluating the Text Segment: A Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I'm ready to tackle this. The user wants me to apply my expertise as a claim-framing coder to this segment: \"There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses, but worldwide, 864 people have contracted it [highly pathogenic avian flu viruses] since 2003, resulting in 456 deaths, according to the CDC and WHO.\" and run it through the 12-step decision tree, starting with Q2.\n\nQ2 focuses on identifying high-potency verbs, metaphors, and other intensifying language. Based on my understanding of framing techniques, this is where we look for the emotional charge in the text. I need to discern if this segment uses language designed to alarm or evoke a strong negative reaction.\n\nScanning the text, I see that it presents factual information about avian flu cases and deaths. It explicitly mentions \"864 people have contracted it\" and \"resulting in 456 deaths,\" which is certainly concerning, but the language itself is neutral.  The segment also uses \"highly pathogenic avian flu viruses\" which I understand is a neutral term according to the TECH_TERM_GUARD.  The task is to determine whether any of the components of Q2 are found in the text.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n*   **High-Potency Verbs:** No, I don't see any of those alarmist verbs like \"ravaged\" or \"crippling.\" \"Contracted\" and \"resulting\" are straightforward, factual terms.\n*   **Superlative + Negative Noun:** Nope, nothing like \"worst crisis\" or \"most devastating disaster\" here.\n*   **Critical Alert Phrase:** No \"on high alert\" or similar phrases are present.\n*   **Potent Metaphors:** No \"ticking time-bombs\" or \"death sentences\" either.\n\nThe segment states the facts but doesn't use any language to make it sound more dangerous than it is. The language is factual and neutral. Therefore, the answer to Q2 is definitively \"no.\" I'll need to provide a rationale to support this negative finding, specifically noting the absence of any Q2 cues.\n"}, {"Q": 3, "answer": "uncertain", "rationale": "The verbs 'contracting' and 'resulting' are not on the Q3 list of moderate verbs; they are plain outcome verbs.", "via": "llm", "regex": null, "batch_id": "single", "batch_size": 1, "batch_pos": 1, "statement_text": "There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses, but worldwide, 864 people have contracted it [highly pathogenic avian flu viruses] since 2003, resulting in 456 deaths, according to the CDC and WHO.", "article_id": 1001, "thoughts": "**Analyzing the Text Against Q3**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this text segment: \"There is no record of Americans contracting highly pathogenic avian flu viruses, but worldwide, 864 people have contracted it [highly pathogenic avian flu viruses] since 2003, resulting in 456 deaths, according to the CDC and WHO.\" My task is to determine if this triggers Q3 of the decision tree. Q3 wants a 'moderate verb' paired with explicit scale or impact information.\n\nFirst, I identified the section I need to analyze. Then, I scanned for 'moderate verbs' from the approved list: *HIT, SWEPT, SOARED, SURGED, PLUMMETED, PROMPTED, SPIKED, PEAKED, JUMPED, SHOT UP, HARD HIT*. The verbs here are \"contracting\" and \"resulting.\" Neither of those match the Q3 list.\n\nNext, I looked for scale or impact information, and found it in \"864 people\" and \"456 deaths.\" That's explicit.  So, the impact is there, but I need a *specific* type of verb.  Are the verbs paired with the scale? Yes, the verbs describe the outcome of \"contracting\".\n\nNow the crux of it: are \"contracting\" and \"resulting\" on the Q3 list? No. They're not the 'moderate verbs' Q3 requires. They are more like plain outcome verbs - things like \"affected,\" \"reported,\" and \"killed,\" which are *explicitly* excluded by rule 4 under \"Boundary Requirements\" for Q3.\n\nI then ran through the other Q3 rules. Rule 1: Verb must be on the list/regex? Failed. Rule 2: Scale adjacency? Irrelevant. Rule 3: Realized impact? Yes, but irrelevant due to the verb issue. Rule 4: Plain outcome verbs are excluded? Yes, \"contracting\" and \"resulting\" fit the description. Rule 5: Containment override? Not applicable here. Rule 6: Financial/trade metrics? Irrelevant.\n\nEven with the \"realized impact\" and \"explicit scale\" aspects, the crucial fact is the verbs don't meet the *specific* criteria of the approved Q3 list. Therefore, based on the *absence* of the required moderate verb, Q3 doesn't fire. The answer is \"no,\" and my rationale is the verbs used are not on the Q3 list of moderate verbs.\n"}]}
