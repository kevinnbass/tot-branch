### QUICK DECISION CHECK
‚Ä¢ Contains INTENSIFIER (**SO / VERY / EXTREMELY / HIGHLY / FRIGHTENINGLY / MORE / DEADLIER**) **AND** RISK‚ÄëADJ (**DEADLY / DANGEROUS / SEVERE / CATASTROPHIC / LETHAL / CONTAGIOUS / VIRULENT / DESTRUCTIVE**) in the **same clause**?  
‚Ä¢ Skip if it's the taxonomic phrase **"highly pathogenic (avian) influenza / HPAI"**.  
‚Üí If yes ‚Üí `"yes"`; else ‚Üí `"no"`.

**CONFIDENCE ENHANCEMENT**: Provide confidence score (0-100%) and rank all three frame types by likelihood.

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example with confidence
## Input Segment: The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.
## Question: Does the segment contain an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","confidence":95,"rationale":"The intensifier 'so' modifies the risk-adjective 'deadly'.","frame_likelihoods":{"Alarmist":95,"Neutral":4,"Reassuring":1}}

# NO example with confidence
## Input Segment: A highly pathogenic form of bird flu was detected.
## Question: Does the segment contain an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","confidence":85,"rationale":"'highly pathogenic' is a technical term, not an authorial intensifier on a general risk-adjective.","frame_likelihoods":{"Alarmist":5,"Neutral":90,"Reassuring":5}}

### Question Q1
**Q1: Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective**
Does the segment feature an intensifier (e.g., 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely') or a comparative adjective (e.g., 'more,' 'deadlier') directly modifying a risk-adjective (e.g., 'deadly,' 'dangerous,' 'severe,' 'catastrophic') as defined in the detailed rules?

**üîç Q1 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **‚Üí Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
<!-- Q1.1 -->
| **Intensifier + Risk-Adj** | "so deadly," "very dangerous," "extremely severe," "highly lethal," "frighteningly contagious" | ‚úì |
<!-- Q1.2 -->
| **Comparative + Risk-Adj** | "more deadly," "deadlier," "more dangerous," "less safe," "increasingly severe" | ‚úì |
<!-- Q1.3 -->
| **Fixed Lethal-from-Outset Idiom** | "deadly from the start," "deadly from the outset" | ‚úì |
| **Base Risk-Adj (alone)** | "deadly," "dangerous," "severe" (without intensifier) | ‚Üí Neutral |

### CONFIDENCE SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Binary Decision Confidence**: Rate your certainty in the yes/no answer (0-100%)
2. **Frame Likelihood Assessment**: Assign likelihood percentages to each frame that sum to 100%
   - **Alarmist**: Likelihood this text shows alarmist framing patterns
   - **Neutral**: Likelihood this text shows neutral/factual reporting 
   - **Reassuring**: Likelihood this text shows reassuring/calming patterns

### Your JSON Reply:
```json
{
  "answer": "yes|no|uncertain",
  "confidence": <0-100>,
  "rationale": "<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>",
  "frame_likelihoods": {
    "Alarmist": <0-100>,
    "Neutral": <0-100>, 
    "Reassuring": <0-100>
  }
}
```

**Ranking Line**: After your JSON, add a ranking of frames by likelihood:
Ranking: <HighestFrame> > <MiddleFrame> > <LowestFrame>
