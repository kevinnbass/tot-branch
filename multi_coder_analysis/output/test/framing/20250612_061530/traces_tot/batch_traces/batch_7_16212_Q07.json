The negation alone is insufficient for Reassuring framing.\n\n\n\n**Key Principle:** A bare negation simply denies or downplays a risk/problem factually.

  "thoughts": "**Analysis of Segments for Bare Negation (Q7)**\n\nMy task is to meticulously evaluate nine text segments for the presence of \"bare negations\" – statements that factually downplay a risk or problem without using explicit calming cues. This is essentially a yes/no question for each segment, with \"yes\" indicating a bare negation.  Here's my thought process, segment by segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** This segment uses the word \"rare\" in the context of human infection.  Since \"rare\" implies a low probability, it *is* a form of downplaying the risk. There are no explicit calming phrases, so I'm deeming this a \"yes\" for Q7 (bare negation).\n\n*   **Segment 2:**  The phrase \"no record of Americans contracting\" is a direct negation regarding documented cases. While factually accurate, it downplays the risk to a specific population. Since there's no calming cue, I mark this \"yes\" as well.\n\n*   **Segments 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9:** These segments don't contain any negation words or explicit calming cues. The absence of both means I'm answering \"no\" for each of these segments.\n\n*   **Segment 6:** This segment contains \"It was not clear.\" Although a negation, it's about the cause or spread, *not* a direct denial of risk or its impact. The context still highlights the deadly nature of the virus. Because the focus of the negation is not directly on the risk itself, I'm assigning a \"no\" for Q7.\n\n*   **Segment 8:** The statement \"does not present a food safety risk\" is a classic bare negation. It explicitly addresses a potential risk (food safety) and negates it. The conditional phrase \"as long as food is properly cooked\" doesn't act as a calming cue, making this a \"yes\".\n\nMy final determination, then, is that segments 1, 2, and 8 contain bare negations without explicit calming cues. All others do not.\n"
