{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_1_20112", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 72}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language like 'found that about one in five samples tested positive' and 'showed none yielded live virus'.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_2_20500", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 35}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'taken', 'found', 'tested positive', 'showed', 'yielded' are plain verbs. 'about one in five' is a proportion, not paired with a moderate verb or framed as significant scale per Q3 rules. 'none yielded live virus' is mitigating language.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_3_9208", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 253}

{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a potentially concerning finding followed by a bare positive fact, lacking explicit calming language.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_5_8932", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 234}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'about one in five samples' which is a scale, but lacks a minimiser like 'only'. It also states 'none yielded live virus', which is a bare negation/positive finding, not 'minimiser + scale contrast'.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_6_20384", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 208}
