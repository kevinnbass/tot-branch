{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains an intensifier ('large') modifying quantity ('amounts') and a risk-adjective ('severe') modifying 'disease' (an outcome), but 'severe' is not modified by an intensifier/comparative.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_1_20944", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 234}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'severe disease' is a factual description of potential outcome, not a high-potency verb or potent metaphor.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_2_1504", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 203}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'could lead to' is a potential outcome. 'large amounts' is vague. 'severe disease' is qualitative.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_3_9208", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 164}
