{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective. 'infectious' is not intensified.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_1_20112", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 65}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language like 'indicates the potential for a relatively small but detectable quantity... to remain infectious'.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_2_20500", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 28}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'indicates', 'remain', 'were', 'wrote' are plain verbs. 'potential for' is about possibility. 'relatively small but detectable quantity' is vague/mitigating.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_3_9208", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 246}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "No question present.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_4_18856", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 233}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a scientific finding and its implication (potential for virus to remain infectious), which is not a calming cue.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_5_8932", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 227}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'relatively small but detectable quantity' uses 'relatively small' as a minimiser, but it's not paired with a scale contrast and is immediately followed by 'but detectable', which reduces the reassuring effect.", "method": "llm_batch", "batch_id": "batch_6_20384", "batch_size": 260, "batch_pos": 201}
