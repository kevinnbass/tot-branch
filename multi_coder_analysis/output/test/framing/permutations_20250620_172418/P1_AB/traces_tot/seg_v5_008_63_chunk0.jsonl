Re-evaluating based on the rule: 'do not present an immediate public health concern' is a bare negation about risk. There is no *additional* explicit calming cue. So it should be yes. Let's check seg_v5_18_1552_chunk0 again. Ah, that was 'It's not recommended that anyone... consume raw milk products.' which is an action negation. My mistake.
