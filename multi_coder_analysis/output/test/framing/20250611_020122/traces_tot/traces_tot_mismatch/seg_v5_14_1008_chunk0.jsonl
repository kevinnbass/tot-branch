{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states the detections do not 'present an immediate public health concern,' which is a statement about risk level, but it does not use an intensifier or comparative adjective to modify a risk-adjective."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment quotes the USDA stating the detections 'do not present an immediate public health concern,' which is a statement of low risk, not a high-potency verb or metaphor."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment quotes the USDA stating the detections 'do not present an immediate public health concern,' which is not a moderate verb paired with scale/impact indicating alarm."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment quotes a source stating the detections do not present an immediate public health concern. It does not contain a loaded rhetorical question."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The phrase 'do not \"present an immediate public health concern\"' is an explicit calming cue from a quoted source (USDA citing CDC data) directly communicating minimized present risk."}
