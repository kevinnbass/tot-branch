{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses factual language ('tested positive') and does not contain high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 cues."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states chickens 'tested positive' which is a factual statement, not a moderate verb from the approved list paired with scale/impact."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment provides a factual statement from a spokesperson and does not contain any loaded rhetorical questions."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text reports a factual statement from a spokesperson about a positive test but lacks explicit calming language or a low-risk evaluation."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The phrase 'one barn among a flock of 240,000' uses a bare numeral ('one') with a scale contrast ('among a flock of 240,000'). While 'one' is not a minimiser according to the strict definition, the combination functions similarly to downplay the significance."}
