{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' directly modifies the risk-adjectives 'infectious' and 'deadly'.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Intensifiers and Comparative Adjectives**\n\nOkay, so I've been given a text segment: \"Because the virus is so infectious and deadly for commercial poultry, entire flocks are destroyed and composted on the farms when they [entire flocks] are infected.\" My task is to determine if it contains an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective, according to the specific criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to pinpoint the relevant section. It's the whole sentence, clearly. Then, I need to identify any potential intensifiers or comparatives. I see \"so\". Next, I have to find the risk-adjectives. \"Infectious\" and \"deadly\" immediately stand out. Now comes the critical step: verifying if \"so\" is actually modifying these risk-adjectives directly.\n\nIt's evident that \"so\" *does* modify \"infectious,\" which is synonymous with the provided example \"contagious,\" and clearly fits the function of a risk-adjective here. Also, \"so\" is clearly modifying \"deadly,\" which is *explicitly* on the list of risk-adjectives.\n\nThis fits the pattern perfectly: an intensifier, \"so,\" directly modifying two risk-adjectives, \"infectious\" and \"deadly.\" Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nMy reasoning is straightforward: the intensifier \"so\" modifies the risk-adjectives \"infectious\" and \"deadly.\" It's a textbook example!"}
