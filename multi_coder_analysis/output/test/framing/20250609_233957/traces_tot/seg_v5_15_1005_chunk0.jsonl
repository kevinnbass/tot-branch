{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The comparative adjective 'more' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'deadly' in 'more deadly viruses'.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Intensifier/Comparative Adjective Modification**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with the text segment: \"Sometimes those strains [of avian influenza] can get into domestic flocks and mutate into *more deadly* viruses.\" My task is to determine if it contains an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the relevant phrase. I spot \"more deadly\" â€“ bingo. Then, I must confirm whether 'more' is indeed a comparative and 'deadly' a risk-adjective. Examining the phrase, I can confirm 'more' is being used as a comparative adjective to 'deadly.' Since the term 'more deadly' appears in the examples list provided, that maps to Alarmist. Given the rules I was provided, and the structure of the phrase, the answer is unequivocally \"yes\". The rationale will cite the phrase, \"more deadly viruses\", and point out how \"more\" is modifying the risk-adjective \"deadly\", falling in the provided pattern."}
