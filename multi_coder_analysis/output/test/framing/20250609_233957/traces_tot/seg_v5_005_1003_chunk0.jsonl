{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'highly' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'lethal'.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Framing: A Quick Assessment**\n\nOkay, so I've got this text segment to analyze, looking specifically for an \"Alarmist frame,\" which, in this context, boils down to identifying whether an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifies a risk-adjective. I'm going to follow the established procedure meticulously.\n\nFirst, I need to pinpoint the segment: *\"They [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\"*\n\nNext, I'll scan for those telltale intensifiers and comparative adjectives â€“ words like *very*, *extremely*, *highly*, *more*, *less*, etc. And, of course, I'll also be on the lookout for risk-adjectives: *dangerous*, *severe*, *lethal*, *contagious* - terms that convey a degree of risk.\n\nI have to carefully check if any intensifier or comparative directly precedes and modifies one of these risk adjectives. The rule I am applying is that an \"Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective\" pattern signals an \"Alarmist frame.\"\n\nLooking at the segment, the phrase \"highly lethal\" immediately stands out. 'Highly' is clearly an intensifier, and 'lethal' is a classic risk-adjective. Crucially, 'highly' directly precedes and modifies 'lethal'.\n\nThus, the segment *does* exhibit the pattern I am looking for!\n\nThe rationale is clear-cut: the intensifier \"highly\" directly modifies the risk-adjective \"lethal\".  The pattern matches!"}
