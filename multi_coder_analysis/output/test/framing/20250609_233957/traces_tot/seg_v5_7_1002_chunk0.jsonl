{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'highly' directly modifies the risk-adjective 'lethal'.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing for Alarmist Language**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a text snippet and I need to determine if it uses any alarmist language, specifically looking for intensifiers or comparative adjectives that directly modify risk-adjectives, as per the Q1 guidelines. First, I need to identify the relevant segment: \"They [Kentucky officials] said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the *highly lethal* bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015.\"\n\nNext, I'll quickly scan for intensifiers and comparative adjectives. I'm looking for words like *so, very, extremely, highly, more, less, deadlier, worse*, etc.  Simultaneously, I'll be on the lookout for risk-adjectives: words like *deadly, lethal, dangerous, severe, catastrophic*, etc.\n\nNow, let's examine the phrase \"highly lethal\" more closely. I can see that *highly* is indeed an intensifier. And *lethal*? Yes, that's definitely a risk-adjective. Crucially, the intensifier *highly* directly modifies *lethal*.  There's no other word intervening or significantly changing the relationship.\n\nNow, I'll double-check this against the established rules. The pattern \"Intensifier + Risk-Adj\" – specifically the example *highly lethal* – is a clear indication of an \"Alarmist\" cue under Q1. Therefore, the answer is yes, the segment *does* contain an example of alarmist language as defined by this particular criterion. Specifically, the intensifier *highly* modifies the risk-adjective *lethal*. I'll format the response accordingly in JSON."}
