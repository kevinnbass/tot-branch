{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment contains the comparative adjective 'more' modifying the risk-adjective 'deadly'.", "thoughts": "**My Evaluation: Triggering the Alarmist Frame**\n\nOkay, I'm analyzing this segment against the Q1 criteria: does it contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective?  The text is: \"Sometimes those strains [of avian influenza] can get into domestic flocks and mutate into more deadly viruses.\" Right away, I see \"more deadly.\" \"More\" is definitely a comparative adjective, and \"deadly\" is absolutely a risk-adjective, fitting my understanding of the terminology in this field. Bingo.  \n\nBased on my knowledge, \"more\" modifies \"deadly\" directly, and that's the pattern we're looking for, \"Comparative + Risk-Adj.\"  I know that pattern triggers the Alarmist frame, as per my internal rules and the pattern recognition table. So, the decisive cue here is \"more deadly,\" and that combination clearly satisfies Q1.  I'm confident in saying the answer is \"yes.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The decisive cue is \\\"more deadly.\\\" The phrase contains the comparative adjective \\\"more\\\" directly modifying the risk-adjective \\\"deadly,\\\" matching the Q1 pattern and triggering the Alarmist frame.\"\n}\n```"}
