{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statements about 'most robust monitoring and surveillance program' and 'detailed plans' are capability/preparedness claims. They do not qualify as Q5 calming cues because the speaker is an industry representative, not a government/public-health authority, and the phrases do not explicitly link to public/consumer safety as required by the rule."}
