{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes potential negative future outcomes ('could rise', 'could drop') based on a hypothetical condition ('if birds... were to be infected'). It contains no explicit language communicating current safety, control, or minimized present risk."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser (like 'only', 'just', 'merely', 'a single', 'few') combined with a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'among millions') to downplay an event."}
