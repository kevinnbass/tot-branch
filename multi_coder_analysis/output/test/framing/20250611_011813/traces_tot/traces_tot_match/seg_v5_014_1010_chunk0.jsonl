{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses economic impact ('burden', 'onerous costs') but does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective describing the outbreak or virus itself."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'impose a burden' and 'onerous costs', which are negative but do not meet the criteria for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 patterns."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses verbs like 'impose' and 'adding', which are not on the list of moderate verbs for Q3. It mentions 'scale' and 'euthanizations' but not paired with a qualifying verb."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a question, loaded or otherwise."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses potential negative impacts (burden on consumers' wallets, onerous costs) and contains no explicit language designed to calm concerns, minimize risk, or assure safety."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses potential negative impacts ('burden', 'onerous costs') and their dependence on 'eventual scale', but does not use a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) in conjunction with a scale contrast ('out of thousands', etc.) to downplay the situation for reassurance."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a potential negative outcome ('impose a burden', 'adding to costs') and does not contain any bare negation or statement downplaying a risk."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a potential negative economic impact, not capabilities, preparedness, or hopeful possibilities."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses non-standard phrasing ('impose a burden') and a strong negative adjective ('onerous') to describe economic impact/costs, which goes beyond neutral reporting of metrics."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment speculates about a potential future negative impact ('could nonetheless impose a burden'), not future relief or improvement."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "Segment contains no direct quotations or attributed statements to evaluate for dominant framing."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues found. Potential negative impact ('impose a burden') is described factually/descriptively without amplification."}
