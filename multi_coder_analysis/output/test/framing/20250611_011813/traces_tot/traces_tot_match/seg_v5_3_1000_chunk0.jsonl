{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verbs used ('reported', 'ordered', 'euthanized') are not on the list of moderate verbs for Q3.

{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'just days after', but 'just' here refers to timing, not a minimised quantity contrasted with a larger scale. The number 'nearly 30,000' is not presented as a minimised quantity."}
