{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes modes of transmission ('in the air in droplets or even possibly dust', 'touches something... then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose') but does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses factual, descriptive language ('can happen', 'is in the air', 'breathes it in', 'touches') without employing high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 framing cues."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes how infection can happen ('can happen', 'breathes', 'touches') but does not use any moderate verbs from the specified list paired with scale or impact information."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes modes of transmission factually and does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text describes potential transmission pathways but contains no explicit calming language, safety assurances, or low-risk evaluations."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes potential modes of transmission but does not use a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) in conjunction with a scale contrast ('out of X', 'among Y') to downplay significance."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes potential modes of transmission ('can happen when...') but contains no bare negation or statement downplaying a risk."}

{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes virus transmission methods and does not report prices, economic data, or numerical metrics."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes current mechanisms of transmission ('can happen when', 'is in the air') and does not speculate about future relief or improvement."}
