{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains 'highly pathogenic disease', but 'highly pathogenic' is treated as a technical term and does not trigger Q1 unless further intensified."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses factual language ('reported', 'ordered... euthanized', 'testing positive') and technical description ('highly pathogenic disease') without employing high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 cues."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verbs used ('reported', 'ordered', 'euthanized', 'testing', 'was', 'found') are not on the Q3 moderate verb list/regex, nor do they fit the required pattern."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no questions, loaded or otherwise."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text reports negative facts (outbreaks, euthanasia, pathogenic disease) and a historical fact neutrally. It contains no explicit calming language or intensified low-risk evaluation from the author or a source."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text mentions 'just days after' but 'just' here refers to timing, not downplaying the scale of the event. 'the first case' is a factual statement about occurrence since 2020, not a minimiser + scale contrast pattern used for reassurance."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any bare negation phrases like 'not expected', 'unlikely', 'no evidence', etc."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "States a safeguard/response measure ('ordered nearly 30,000 turkeys to be euthanized') factually without explicit reassurance."}
