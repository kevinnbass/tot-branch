{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'highly pathogenic' is part of the technical name for the disease strain (H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu) and is explicitly excluded from triggering Q1 unless further alarmist cues are present."}

{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The text reports a negative fact (chickens infected with highly pathogenic flu) but contains no explicit language from the author or quoted source to calm concerns, assure safety, or minimize risk to the public."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states where the infection occurred but does not use a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) or an explicit scale contrast to downplay its significance."}

{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment attributes information to 'Kentucky officials' but the statement itself ('were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu') is a factual report of a negative event without explicit framing language from the source."}
