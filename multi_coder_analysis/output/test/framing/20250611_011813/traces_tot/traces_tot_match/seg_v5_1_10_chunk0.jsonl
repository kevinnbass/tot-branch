{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'highly pathogenic' is treated as a technical term describing the strain, not an authorial intensifier on a general risk-adjective, per the technical-term guard."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses neutral language ('culled', 'discovered', 'announced') and technical terms ('highly pathogenic strain') without employing high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other Q2 alarmist cues."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'are to be culled' is a future action, not a realised impact, and is excluded by the Q3 rule. 'was discovered' is not a moderate verb."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a factual statement and does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (culling due to bird flu) announced by an official source, but it contains no explicit language or cues designed to calm concerns, assure safety, or minimize perceived risk."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment mentions 'More than 35,000 chickens' and 'at a Dutch farm' but lacks a minimiser ('only', 'just', 'few') combined with an explicit scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'nationwide') to downplay the event."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a negative event (discovery of highly pathogenic strain, culling) and does not contain any bare negation or language downplaying a risk."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment describes a response measure ('are to be culled') without explicitly linking it to current calm or safety."}
