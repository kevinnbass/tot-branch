{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective directly modifying a risk-adjective."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The term 'depopulated' is a technical description of a necessary action in disease control, not a high-potency verb or metaphor used to actively frame the situation alarmingly according to Q2 rules."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verbs used ('said', 'will be depopulated', 'is complete') are not on the list of moderate verbs for Q3. 'Depopulated' is explicitly excluded unless paired with large scale, which is not present."}

{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states facts about depopulation but does not use a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) combined with a scale contrast ('out of X') to downplay the event for reassurance."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes actions taken ('will be depopulated', 'depopulation is complete') rather than containing a bare negation pattern like 'not expected', 'unlikely', or 'no evidence'."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Describes the measure 'depopulation' taken 'to prevent the spread' and its completion, without explicit reassurance."}
