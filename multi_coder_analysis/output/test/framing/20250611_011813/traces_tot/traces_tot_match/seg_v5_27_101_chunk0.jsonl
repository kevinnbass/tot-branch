{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the verb 'warned' and the phrase 'become more volatile', neither of which are high-potency verbs or potent metaphors as defined in Q2."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'could become more volatile,' which is a future/speculative statement, not a moderate verb describing realised impact paired with scale/impact information."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement, not a question, and therefore does not contain a loaded rhetorical question."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment warns about potential price volatility and does not contain any explicit calming language or cues about safety, control, or minimized risk."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment 'Experts also warned that turkey prices could also become more volatile' does not contain a minimiser word or a scale contrast element required for Q6."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a bare negation pattern like 'not expected', 'unlikely', 'no evidence', or 'cannot'."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a potential negative future outcome (price volatility), not capabilities, preparedness, or hopeful possibilities."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports on prices using a standard verb ('become') and the neutral economic descriptor 'more volatile' in a modal context ('could also become more volatile'), as per Q9 rules."}
