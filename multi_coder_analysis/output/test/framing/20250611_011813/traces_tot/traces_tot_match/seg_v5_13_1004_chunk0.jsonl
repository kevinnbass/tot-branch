{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the word 'deadly' but it is not modified by an intensifier or comparative listed in Q1."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'threatens to spark' and 'increase', which are not high-potency verbs or metaphors as defined for Q2. 'soaring' modifies background inflation."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses verbs like 'threatens to spark' which describe potential future impact, not realised impact from the Q3 moderate verb list. 'soaring' describes a background condition (inflation), which is excluded by the context guard."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains statements, not questions. There are no loaded rhetorical questions present."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'does not present a food safety risk as long as food is properly cooked' is a bare negation stating a fact under a condition, not an explicit calming cue as defined by Q5."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a 'minimiser' (only, just, merely, a single, few) combined with an explicit 'scale contrast' (out of X, among Y) to downplay an event for reassurance."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'does not present a food safety risk' is a bare negation without an explicit calming cue."}
