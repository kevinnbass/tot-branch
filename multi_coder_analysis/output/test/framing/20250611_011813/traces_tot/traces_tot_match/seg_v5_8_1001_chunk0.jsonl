{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective. 'challenged', 'rising inflation', and 'supply chain issues' are not risk-adjectives modified by intensifiers/comparatives."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses moderate language ('challenged', 'rising') to describe background conditions ('inflation', 'supply chain issues'). It does not contain high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative negative nouns, or the 'on high alert' phrase as defined for Q2."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'culled' as an adjective referring to birds already culled, not as a main verb describing the event with explicit scale/impact. Background conditions are ignored."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement and does not contain a question, loaded or otherwise."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statement reports a positive fact (culled birds not entering food system) but lacks explicit calming language or framing to reassure the public about current safety, control, or minimized risk."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states that culled birds will not enter the food system but does not use a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) or a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'nationwide') to downplay the event or its significance."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'will not enter the food system' is a bare negation without an explicit calming cue."}
