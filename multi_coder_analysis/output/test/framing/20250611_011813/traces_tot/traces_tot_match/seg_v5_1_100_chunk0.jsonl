{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the consequence (culling) and spread, but does not use an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verbs 'spread' and 'killed' are factual descriptions of the event and its consequence, not high-potency verbs or metaphors that actively frame the situation alarmingly according to Q2 rules."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'killed' is a plain outcome verb, not a Q3 moderate verb. The action 'will have to be killed' denotes a future plan, not realised impact."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a factual statement reporting events and does not contain any questions, loaded or otherwise."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (birds killed due to flu spread) neutrally. It does not contain explicit calming language or assurances of safety/control from the source or author."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports numbers (15,000 chickens, 37,000 turkeys, two farms) but does not use a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) in conjunction with a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'nationwide') to downplay the event for reassurance."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes negative events (culling, spread) but does not contain any bare negation phrases that deny or downplay a risk or problem."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a negative fact (animals killed due to spread) and does not describe capabilities, preparedness, or future possibilities."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Reports numerical metrics ('15,000 chickens', '37,000 turkeys', 'two more farms') using standard verbs ('killed', 'spread') without vivid language or framing."}
