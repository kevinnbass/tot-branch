{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective listed in Q1. 'rare' describes frequency, not risk severity, and is not intensified."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses moderate language ('occur', 'considered rare') and does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases listed in Q2."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'occur' and 'considered', neither of which are on the list of moderate verbs for Q3. 'rare' describes frequency, not scale/impact."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a statement of fact and does not contain a question, loaded or otherwise."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'considered rare' reports a low risk fact but lacks the explicit calming language or intensification ('very rare', 'extremely rare') required for Q5 Reassuring. It is a bare statement of low risk."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states 'they're considered rare' but does not use a specific minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) combined with an explicit scale contrast ('out of X') as required by Q6."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'considered rare' functions as a bare negation/downplaying of risk without an explicit calming cue."}
