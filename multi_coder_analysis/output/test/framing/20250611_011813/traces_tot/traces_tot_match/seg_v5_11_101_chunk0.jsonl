{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains the phrase 'pretty rare'. While 'pretty' is an intensifier, 'rare' is not a risk-adjective (e.g., deadly, dangerous, severe) as defined by Q1 rules and examples."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or critical alert phrases as defined by Q2."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the verb 'been' and the descriptor 'pretty rare', neither of which are moderate verbs from the Q3 list paired with significant scale/impact."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains a statement attributed to a source, not a loaded rhetorical question from the author or source."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The phrase 'pretty rare' describes the historical frequency of the event, but it is not an explicit calming cue or an intensified low-risk evaluation about current safety as defined by Q5 criteria."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'pretty rare' but lacks the specific 'minimiser + scale contrast' pattern required by Q6 (e.g., 'only X out of Y')."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states the virus is 'not impossible' (affirming possibility) and 'pretty rare' (stating low frequency factually), neither of which fits the definition of a bare negation denying or downplaying a risk/problem as per Q7."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the past frequency of infection ('been pretty rare'), not capabilities, preparedness, safeguards, or future possibilities."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses the rarity of a virus infection, not prices, economic data, or numerical metrics as defined by Q9."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the current/past state of the virus's rarity ('been pretty rare') rather than speculating about future relief or improvement."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The quote presents a possibility ('not impossible') and a low incidence fact ('pretty rare') but lacks explicit dominant alarmist or reassuring framing language."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'pretty rare' is an explicit framing cue (low-risk fact amplified by intensifier) preventing default to Neutral."}
