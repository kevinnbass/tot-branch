{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states infections are 'considered rare', which describes frequency/likelihood, not an intensified risk-adjective like 'deadly' or 'dangerous'."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses moderate language ('occur', 'considered rare', 'said') and lacks high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative negative nouns, or critical alert phrases."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verbs 'occur' and 'are considered' are not on the list of moderate verbs for Q3. 'Rare' describes frequency, not large-scale realised impact."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains statements, not a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statement 'considered rare' reports a low-risk fact but does not use explicit calming language or intensified low-risk phrasing required for Q5 Reassuring."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'rare' to describe frequency, but this rule requires specific lexical minimisers ('only', 'just', 'merely', 'a single', 'few') combined with an explicit scale contrast ('out of X', 'among Y'), which are not present."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'considered rare' is a bare negation/downplaying of risk without an explicit calming cue."}
