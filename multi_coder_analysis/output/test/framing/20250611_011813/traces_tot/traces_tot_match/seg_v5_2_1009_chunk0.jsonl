{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes the location as 'small, non-commercial backyard block' which implies limited scope, but it does not use a lexical minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) combined with an explicit scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'nationwide') as required by Q6."}
