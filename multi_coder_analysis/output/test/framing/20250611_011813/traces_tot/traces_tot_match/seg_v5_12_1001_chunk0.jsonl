{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains no questions, rhetorical or otherwise."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports the absence of US cases and provides worldwide statistics, but lacks explicit calming language or intensified low-risk evaluation from the author or a source."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment provides specific numbers (864 cases, 456 deaths) but does not use a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) in conjunction with a scale contrast ('out of', 'among') to downplay the figures for reassurance. Bare numerals are not minimisers per the rules."}
