{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states 'high mortality rates'. 'high' modifies 'mortality rates' (a metric/outcome), not a risk-adjective like 'deadly' or 'severe'. This is a factual statement about the outcome, not an authorial intensification of a risk-adjective."}

{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'can cause' is not on the list of moderate verbs and describes potential impact, not a realised event."}
