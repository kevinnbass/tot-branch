{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains 'very low', which is an intensifier ('very') modifying an adjective ('low'). However, 'low' is not a risk-adjective as defined by Q1 (e.g., 'deadly', 'dangerous', 'severe'). Q1 targets amplification of negative risk."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative-negative nouns, or the phrase 'on high alert'."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with scale or impact information."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains a statement, not a question. Q4 requires a loaded rhetorical question."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The phrase 'risk to humans is very low' uses the intensifier 'very' with 'low risk', matching the 'Lowâ€‘Risk Evaluation (+ Intensifier)' pattern for Reassuring."}
