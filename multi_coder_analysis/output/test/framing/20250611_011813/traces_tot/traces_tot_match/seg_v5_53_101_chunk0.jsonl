{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a method and disposal ('carbon dioxide is used to kill the birds, whose carcasses are often composted or placed in a landfill') but contains no minimiser ('only', 'just', 'merely', 'a single', 'few') or scale contrast ('out of X', 'among Y') to downplay significance."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a process and outcome ('used to kill the birds', 'carcasses are often composted or placed in a landfill') but does not contain a bare negation about risk, expectation, evidence, or capability as defined by Q7."}
