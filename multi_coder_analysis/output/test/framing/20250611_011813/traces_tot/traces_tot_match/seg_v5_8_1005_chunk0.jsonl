{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective, nor the fixed idiom 'deadly from the start/outset'."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states facts about the lack of human cases and public health concern, but does not use high-potency verbs, metaphors, or other Q2 patterns to frame the situation alarmingly."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain any of the specified moderate verbs paired with scale or impact information."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains statements, not a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statement 'no human cases have been detected' is a bare positive fact. 'doesn’t present an immediate public health concern' is a bare negation/low-risk statement explicitly listed as Neutral in the Q5 exclusion criteria, lacking explicit calming amplification."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states the absence of cases ('no human cases') and mentions the scope ('in the U.S.') but does not use a minimiser (like 'only', 'just', 'few') combined with a scale contrast ('out of X') to downplay a number or event."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'no human cases have been detected' and 'doesn’t present an immediate public health concern' are bare negations without explicit calming cues."}
