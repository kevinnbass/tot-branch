{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains the adjective 'concerning' and the comparative 'more' modifying 'poultry operations', but not an intensifier or comparative directly modifying a risk-adjective from the specified list or type."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the adjective 'concerning' and the moderate verb 'affected', neither of which are high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, or other specific cues listed for Q2."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'concerning' (adjective) and 'affected' (plain outcome verb, excluded by Q3 rules). It also describes a hypothetical future increase ('if more... are found'), not a realised impact paired with a moderate verb."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment contains a statement, not a loaded rhetorical question."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the word 'concerning' and discusses potential negative future developments, which is the opposite of providing an explicit calming cue."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser (e.g., 'only', 'just') combined with a scale contrast to downplay the event. It discusses potential future spread ('more poultry operations')."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states the infections 'are concerning' and discusses conditions for increased concern, which is not a bare negation."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not describe capabilities, preparedness measures, hopeful future possibilities, or implemented safeguards."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not report prices, economic data, or numerical metrics. It discusses infections and poultry operations."}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment discusses current concerns and potential future worsening, not speculation about future relief or improvement."}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a direct quote or clearly attributed statement from a specific source."}
{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit intensifiers, vivid verbs, or loaded metaphors/adjectives meeting the threshold for Alarmist amplification. 'Concerning' is evaluative but functions as a factual description of the situation's nature rather than explicit amplification. No Reassuring cues. Defaults to Neutral."}
