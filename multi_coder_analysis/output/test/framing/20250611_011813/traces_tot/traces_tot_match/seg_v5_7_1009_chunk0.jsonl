{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statement 'do not present an an immediate health concern' is a bare negation/statement of fact about risk level, explicitly listed as Neutral (not Reassuring) in the Q5 exclusion criteria."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment states the detections 'do not present an immediate health concern' but lacks both a minimiser ('only', 'just', etc.) and a scale contrast ('out of thousands', etc.) required for Q6."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "'do not present an immediate health concern' is a bare negation without an explicit calming cue."}
