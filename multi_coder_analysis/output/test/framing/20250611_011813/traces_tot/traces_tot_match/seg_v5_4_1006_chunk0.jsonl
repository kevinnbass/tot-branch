{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative adjective modifying a risk-adjective, nor the 'deadly from the start/outset' idiom."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verbs 'spreads', 'impact', 'raising', and 'impacting' are moderate and do not meet the criteria for high-potency verbs or other Q2 cues."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes a hypothetical future scenario ('If... it could impact...') and does not use a Q3 moderate verb paired with explicit scale/impact to describe a realised event."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a declarative statement describing potential impacts, not a loaded rhetorical question."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes potential negative impacts ('could impact production', 'raising consumer prices') but contains no explicit language designed to calm concerns or reassure the audience about current safety or control."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes potential negative impacts ('impact the production', 'raising consumer prices', 'impacting exports') and does not contain a 'minimiser + scale contrast' pattern for reassurance."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes potential negative impacts ('could impact', 'raising consumer prices', 'impacting exports') rather than containing a bare negation of a risk or problem."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes potential negative impacts (impact on production, prices, exports) based on a hypothetical condition, not capabilities, preparedness, or hopeful future possibilities."}
{"Q": 9, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The segment reports potential changes to consumer prices and exports using standard descriptive verbs ('raising', 'impacting') without vivid language or risk adjectives."}
