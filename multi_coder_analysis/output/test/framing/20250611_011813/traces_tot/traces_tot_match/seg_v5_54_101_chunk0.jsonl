{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The comparative 'more' modifies 'humane', which is not a risk-adjective. 'die from the virus' describes an outcome, not a modified risk-adjective."}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses the terms 'culling' and 'die', which are factual descriptions of actions/outcomes, not high-potency verbs or potent metaphors that actively frame the situation alarmingly per Q2 rules."}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment uses 'culling' and 'die', neither of which are qualifying moderate verbs for Q3. No scale/impact is provided."}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment is a statement, not a question, and does not contain a loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm."}
{"Q": 5, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The statement argues that culling is more humane for the birds than letting them die from the virus. It does not contain explicit calming language related to public safety, control, or minimized risk for humans."}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser (like 'only', 'just', 'few') or a scale contrast ('out of thousands', 'among millions')."}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment compares the humaneness of culling versus death from the virus; it does not contain a bare negation of a risk or problem as defined by Q7."}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Describes a measure ('culling') and its justification ('more humane') without explicitly linking it to current calm or safety for the audience."}
