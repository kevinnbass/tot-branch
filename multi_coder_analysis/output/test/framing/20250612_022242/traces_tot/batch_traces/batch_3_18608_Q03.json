(Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: \"The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%.\" (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).\n* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: \"Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds.\" (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').\n\n**Key Principle:** \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" \"plummeted\" can be potent verbs on their own (see Q2) if used dramatically. This rule specifically addresses their use when their alarmist nature is confirmed by accompanying details of scale/impact.\n\n**Boundary Requirements (clarified):**\n1. Verb **must appear in the approved list / regex**.  \n2. Must denote realised impact (not a plan or hypothetical).  \n3. Plain outcome verbs (*killed, died, affected, reported*) are excluded—Neutral unless other cues fire.\n\n**Examples of Scale/Impact Indicators:**\n- Numerical quantities: \"millions,\" \"thousands,\" \"50%,\" \"record numbers\"\n- Comparative terms: \"largest,\" \"highest,\" \"most severe,\" \"unprecedented\"\n- Impact descriptors: \"overwhelming,\" \"devastating losses,\" \"widespread damage\"\n\n> **New aspect guard.** The moderate-verb must denote **realised impact** – NOT merely an intention or hypothetical.  \n\n**Regex Pattern (tightened – comment shows exclusion):**\n```regex\n\\b(hit|swept|surged|soared|plunged|plummeted|prompted|feared|fearing|\n     # ONLY active, realised culling counts\n     (?:were|was)\\s+culled|hitting)\\b\n(?=[^.]{0,12}\\b(?:\\d|million|millions|thousand|thousands|record|largest|unprecedented|severe|significant|overwhelming|devastating)\\b)\n```\n# Passive/future forms (\"to be culled\", \"had to be culled\", \"planning to cull\")\n# fall through to Q8 (capability) or Q10 (speculative relief).\n\n**Clarification (v 2.16.2)** — Containment actions  \n\"Birds were *euthanized/depopulated* to prevent spread\" is **Neutral** unless paired with an explicit large-scale impact (e.g., \"euthanized ***millions*** of birds across 10 states\").\n\nIf the parser lemmatises verbs, **keep only the past-tense form** `culled`; exclude the lemma \"cull\" and its gerund unless explicitly preceded by a past-tense auxiliary (\"were/was culling\") that confirms an event already occurred.\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` ",

  "thoughts": "**Applying Q3 to Text Segments: A Detailed Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to apply Q3 to this list of text segments. The goal is to identify segments that use \"moderate verbs\" from a specified list (or matching a regex) *and* are explicitly paired with information detailing significant scale or impact. I need to be methodical here, so I'm going to walk through each segment and meticulously check for these elements.\n\nHere's my approach: I'm going to read each segment and keep an eye out for verbs like 'hit', 'swept', 'surged', 'soared', and others on the approved list. Also, I need to look for any indications of significant scale like numbers (e.g., millions, thousands, percentages) or comparatives (e.g., largest, highest), or explicit impact descriptors (e.g., devastating). I'll also need to exclude verbs that are clearly just describing the outcome, like 'killed' or 'affected,' unless they are specifically paired with a quantifier indicating scale or impact. The passive and future tense forms are automatically out. The verbs in my regex are the most important part of this exercise.\n\nLet's dive in:\n\n*   **Segments 1-11:** All seem to have no moderate verbs paired with scale/impact.\n*   **Segment 13:** \"Mandated culling\" - 'culling' is not past tense and doesn't match the regex. I'll need to flag this for Q8/Q10.\n*   **Segments 14-21:** Nothing. No matching verbs and no scale/impact.\n*   **Segment 22:** Mentions \"more than a dozen states,\" but the verb \"detected\" doesn't fit my criteria.\n*   **Segment 23:** Uses \"totaled\" with \"more than 17 million,\" but again, \"totaled\" isn't on my list.\n*   **Segment 24:** This one uses \"would be required to be euthanized\" -- passive/future, needs Q8/Q10.\n*   **Segment 25-27:** Mentions significant numbers and scale, but the verbs don't match (e.g., \"constituted\", \"was made up of\").\n*   **Segment 29:** Describes nearly 50 million birds, but \"died\" is the verb and it's outcome-focused, not moderate/potent.\n*   **Segment 30:** \"Has raised concerns\" -- doesn't fit.\n*   **Segment 31:** Contains a similar situation to segment 29. Large number of chickens, but the verb is \"killed\" and not a potent one.\n*   **Segment 32:** Finally, a match! \"Iowa has been particularly *hard hit*, with disasters being declared...\" -- 'hard hit' *is* on the list, and it's explicitly linked to \"disasters being declared.\" That works.\n*   **Segment 33:** Mentions how a virus spreads via nasal secretions - no matching verbs.\n*   **Segments 34-36:** Nada. No matches.\n*   **Segments 37-41:** Nothing here either.\n*   **Segments 42-43:** 'Halted' is the only verb. It does not fit.\n*   **Segment 44:** \"Seeing more spread,\" but 'seeing' isn't on the list.\n*   **Segments 45-53:** More of the same, no hits.\n\nSo, after a thorough review, only **Segment 32** seems to genuinely match the Q3 criteria: *'Iowa has been particularly hard hit, with disasters being declared in some counties.'* The combination of the moderate verb 'hard hit' and the clear indication of significant impact (disasters being declared) makes this segment a valid hit.\n"
