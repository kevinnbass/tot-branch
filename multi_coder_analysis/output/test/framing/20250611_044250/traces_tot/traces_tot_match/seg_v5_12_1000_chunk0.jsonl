{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segments for Alarmist Framing (Q1)**\n\nMy task was to act as an expert claim-framing coder, analyzing each text segment against a 12-step decision tree, starting with Q1. This initial question focuses on identifying intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly modifying risk-adjectives within each segment.  My analysis strictly adhered to the provided rules, examples, the Bedrock Principle (code presentation only), the Symmetry Rule, and the Precedence Ladder (Q1 priority). The \"Technical-term guard\" was absolute.\n\nFor each segment, I meticulously examined the text, looking for instances of intensifiers (e.g., \"so,\" \"very\") or comparatives (e.g., \"more,\" \"deadlier\") preceding risk-adjectives (e.g., \"deadly,\" \"dangerous\").  I also checked the provided pattern recognition table, detailed rules, and regex patterns for confirmation, documenting my rationale for each \"yes\" or \"no\" decision. The goal was to identify if an alarmist frame, signaled by modified risk-adjectives, was present.  Based on my comprehensive analysis, none of the text segments met the criteria for an \"Alarmist\" frame according to the initial Q1 test.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 1,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 2,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 3,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 4,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 5,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 6,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 7,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 8,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 9,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 10,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verbs 'joined', 'banning', and 'limiting' are not high-potency verbs according to the Q2 criteria.", "thoughts": "**Processing Text Segments for Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, I've been tasked with analyzing ten text segments to identify instances of \"Alarmist\" framing, specifically based on Q2 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if each segment contains high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert\" (paired with a threat word).  I need to provide a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer for each segment, along with the rationale and the specific cue if applicable, and I need to output a single JSON array with the segment ID, answer, and rationale.\n\nHere's how I went through each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:**  I looked for any alarmist signals. The verbs \"triggered\" and \"blocking\" weren't high-potency. No metaphors, superlative + negative combinations, or the phrase \"on high alert\" appeared. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 2:** I scanned for the alarmist triggers.  The verb \"limited\" wasn't high-potency. No other signs of alarmist framing were present. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 3:**  Again, I scanned for any framing cues and \"infected\", which is the only verb, is not high-potency.  \"Highly pathogenic avian flu\" is a technical term, not a potent metaphor or phrase. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 4:**  I checked for the four alarmist categories and only saw \"culled\" and \"enter\", neither of which are high-potency verbs. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 5:**  I ran through the segment and found the verbs, working, prevent, spreading, heightening, but none were considered high-potency verbs for alarmist framing, and no other Q2 cues were present. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 6:**  Here, I looked for my cues. The verbs I saw (\"expected\", \"lower\", \"raise\") were not high-potency. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 7:** I looked for alarmist framing, and found nothing. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 8:**  The only verb was \"expect,\" so the answer is no. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 9:** I scrutinized this segment but found no alarmist framing indicators. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 10:**  There are verbs in this segment, but none are high-potency. Answer: No.\n\nSince none of the segments exhibited any of the \"Alarmist\" framing markers I was looking for, my final output will be a JSON array containing \"no\" for each segment. I'm ready to generate the JSON array.\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "No loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm is present in the text.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Alarmist Rhetoric (Q4)**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've been tasked with acting as a claim-framing expert, applying a 12-step decision tree, specifically focusing on Step Q4: Loaded Rhetorical Question for Alarm. My mission is to meticulously examine a series of text segments, determine if they contain a loaded rhetorical question that's designed to instill fear or urgency. I'll flag anything that meets that criteria.\n\nMy current focus is on detecting questions that are explicitly loaded or emotionally charged, clearly intended to imply an alarmist frame. This means I'm looking for questions that go beyond neutral information-seeking and instead aim to trigger concern about a worrisome threat.\n\nI've carefully reviewed each segment, and it's pretty clear cut. *None* of them contain any questions, let alone the kind I'm looking for. Based on my analysis and applying the Q4 criteria, the answer for all the text segments is a resounding \"no.\"  The rationale is straightforward: no loaded rhetorical questions implying alarm were identified in any of the segments. This was a pretty quick evaluation because there were no questions present.\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser combined with a scale contrast.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Reassuring Frames - Q6: Minimiser + Scale Contrast**\n\nMy task was to apply a very specific rule – looking for a \"minimiser\" (like 'only' or 'few') *combined with* a \"scale contrast\" (like 'among millions' or 'thousands of farms') – within these text segments to identify reassuring frames. This specific combination is part of my 12-step decision tree for evaluating claims.\n\nAnalyzing each segment, I carefully checked for the presence of both minimisers and scale contrasts. While some segments contained scale contrasts (e.g., \"thousands of farms\"), none of them used a minimiser in conjunction with the scale contrast to create the desired reassuring frame.  Therefore, after reviewing all segments against the criteria for Q6, I found that *none* of them met the requirements. My analysis concluded \"no\" for all segments.\n"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "Segment does not contain a bare negation.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segments for Bare Negation (Q7)**\n\nMy task is to meticulously evaluate each text segment against the criteria for \"Bare Negation without Explicit Calming Cue\" (Q7) within a 12-step decision tree for claim framing. I need to apply the rule: Does the segment contain a bare negation (like 'not expected', 'unlikely') WITHOUT an explicit calming cue framing the negation as reassuring? If YES, the frame is Neutral, and I must output JSON. If NO, the analysis would proceed to Q8 (which is not relevant for this step, however).\n\nI've carefully analyzed each of the ten segments provided:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8 would be the next step, but that's beyond my scope.\n*   **Segment 2:** The phrase \"will not enter the food system\" is a clear bare negation, with no accompanying calming cue. Therefore, the answer is YES, and the frame is Neutral.\n*   **Segment 3:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n*   **Segment 4:** The phrase \"is not expected to lower overall chicken production levels\" constitutes a bare negation without a calming cue. This triggers a YES answer, and a Neutral frame.\n*   **Segment 5:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n*   **Segment 6:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n*   **Segment 7:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n*   **Segment 8:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n*   **Segment 9:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n*   **Segment 10:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n\nTherefore, my final JSON output, correctly formatted and in accordance with the specifications, is:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_004_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_006_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"'will not enter the food system' is a bare negation without additional calming language.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_007_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_008_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"'is not expected to lower overall chicken production levels' is a bare negation without additional calming language.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_009_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_010_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_11_1000_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_12_1000_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_13_1000_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_14_1000_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  }\n]\n```\nThe analysis is now complete. The segments identified as \"YES\" for the bare negation rule (2 and 4) are ready for further framing steps, but this concludes Q7. All other segments would proceed to the next stage of the decision tree.\n"}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "no", "rationale": "Describes negative events/consequences, not capability/preparedness.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Segments Through the Q8 Lens**\n\nOkay, so the task is to apply Q8 of this decision tree to ten segments of text. Q8 is all about identifying segments that describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards *without* explicitly linking them to present calm, safety, or minimized risk. If it's a \"yes,\" then it's Neutral according to Q8. If not, we move on. Simple enough in concept, but each segment requires careful consideration.\n\nLet's break down my thought process for each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** This is straightforward. The segment details a safeguard (cooking kills bacteria), but it doesn't reassure about *current* safety. So, it's a \"yes\" to Q8. I'll quote the safeguard in my rationale.\n*   **Segments 2-4 & 9:** These are all clearly describing negative events like export restrictions or outbreaks. Q8 doesn't apply; it's not about safeguards, capabilities, or hopeful possibilities. These are \"no\" answers.\n*   **Segment 5:** This is a bit more nuanced. It highlights Tyson's actions to prevent spread and heighten safety measures. These are definitely preparedness measures. The crucial point: it doesn't *explicitly* reassure the audience about present safety. So, \"yes\" to Q8. The decisive cues are the phrases about *preventing the spread* and *heightening safety*.\n*   **Segment 6:** This looks like it *should* be Reassuring because it's a direct statement of safety. However, I'm specifically evaluating Q8, which is about capability/preparedness *without* reassurance. Since it directly assures safety, Q8's criteria aren't met. So, \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 7:** This focuses on expectations about *future* test results. It's related to the response plan, which includes surveillance, and testing. It's a preparedness action, and crucially, it doesn't reassure the audience about immediate safety. So it is a \"yes.\" I'll quote the decisive cue, the expectation of \"final test results.\"\n*   **Segment 8:** This is a mix of recommendations and statements about ongoing response plans. Both parts fall under preparedness. It doesn't calm the reader by saying the situation is under control, so Q8 is a \"yes.\" The rationale needs to cover the recommendation and the description of the response plan, quoting the key phrases of each.\n*   **Segment 10:** This is purely an economic fact. It has nothing to do with safeguards, preparedness, or reassurances. Therefore, \"no.\"\n\nNow that I've carefully analyzed each segment against the Q8 pattern, I'm ready to create the JSON array. The key here is to accurately and concisely explain *why* each segment is a \"yes\" or a \"no\" based on the specific criteria of Q8. This is where expertise comes in: recognizing the nuances of language and how it relates to risk communication.\n"}

It reports \"largest producer and second-largest exporter,\" which are numerical rankings, reported factually.\n*   **Segment 3:** I judged this as a *yes* based on \"supplies have dropped,\" which is reporting an economic metric using standard language.\n*   **Segment 4:** This gets a *yes* as it reports \"supplies were down 14 percent\" and \"inventories were down 23 percent.\"  These are economic metrics with standard description.\n*   **Segment 5:** This is a *no*.  It reports locations and dates, not prices or metrics.\n*   **Segment 6:** This is a *no*.  It reports a date and location, not economic data or metrics.\n*   **Segment 7:** This is a *no*. It doesn't report prices or metrics, though I recognized the potential for a technical interpretation.\n*   **Segment 8:** This is a *yes* because it reports a numerical metric, \"flock of about 240,000 chickens tested positive\" with standard language.\n*   **Segment 9:** This is a *yes* for reporting \"supplies are down,\" an economic metric reported neutrally.\n*   **Segment 10:** This is a *yes* for reporting \"supplies were down 14 percent\" and \"inventories were down 23 percent,\" which are economic metrics reported factually.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 1,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Reports an action, not prices or numerical metrics.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 2,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\\\"largest producer and second-largest exporter\\\"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 3,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\\\"supplies have dropped\\\"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 4,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\\\"supplies were down 14 percent\\\", \\\"inventories were down 23 percent\\\"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 5,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Reports locations/dates, not prices/metrics.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 6,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Reports date/location, not prices/metrics.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 7,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Reports data not in question.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 8,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\\\"flock of about 240,000 chickens tested positive\\\"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 9,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\\\"supplies are down\\\"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 10,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\\\"supplies were down 14 percent\\\", \\\"inventories were down 23 percent\\\"\"\n  }\n]\n```\n"}
{"Q": 10, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment reports a past event (import bans/limits), not future relief speculation.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Future Relief Speculation (Q10)**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process as I tackled this task. I've been asked to apply my expertise as a claim-framing coder to these text segments. My current point of analysis is Q10 in the decision tree: \"Does the segment speculate about potential future relief or improvement WITHOUT an explicit calming cue from the author/source about the *current* state of risk or safety?\"\n\nMy approach has been straightforward. I carefully read each segment, focusing on whether it projects forward to a future state of improvement or relief. The presence of any optimistic or forward-looking language is the key indicator here.\n\n*   **Segment 1 through 10:** In each case, my analysis landed on \"no\" for Q10. The segments predominantly describe the current situation regarding bird flu, report past events, or mention consequences of the outbreak. There's no speculation about future improvement or relief. The segments are objective in their presentation of fact.\n\nThe rationale for the \"no\" answers is consistent: none of the segments employ language that hints at future relief, like phrases such as \"may ease,\" \"could improve,\" or \"expect recovery.\" The segments focused on the present or past events, not the future. Segment 9 is an important observation: it is an explicit statement of current safety and therefore considered in previous steps.\n\nTherefore, the output will be a JSON array where each object indicates `segment_id`, the `answer` of \"no\" to Q10, and a rationale indicating that the segment did not contain speculative language about future improvement. This aligns with my understanding of the framing task.\n"}
{"Q": 11, "answer": "no", "rationale": "No direct quotes or clearly attributed statements with explicit framing language.", "thoughts": "**My Approach to Framing Analysis (Q11)**\n\nAlright, so I'm deep in the weeds, applying this 12-step decision tree to these text snippets. Right now, I'm focusing on Q11: does a direct quote provide a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame?  My expertise in claim framing comes into play here. I have to be incredibly precise, especially with the subtle nuances of language.\n\nFirst, I scour each segment for direct quotes. If I find one, I meticulously analyze it, looking for framing language – specifically, explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues. I have to keep in mind, of course, that certain technical terms, like \"highly pathogenic avian,\" are guarded and don't automatically trigger an alarmist response. It's about context, the specific wording, and whether it's clearly framing the information.\n\nIf a direct quote *does* present a dominant frame (either Alarmist or Reassuring), I mark it as a \"yes\" for Q11, state the frame I see, and provide a rationale that includes that key piece of evidence. Then, I move on to the next segment.\n\nIf there are no quotes, or the quotes are neutral, balanced, or overridden by the author's framing, then it's a \"no\" for Q11, and I move on to the next segment.\n\nFor these segments, the following evaluations were made:\n\n*   **Segment 1-8 and 10:** No dominant frames found, hence the 'no' for Q11.\n*   **Segment 9:** Analyzed Mickelson's statement.  \"Safe to eat\" is a direct reassuring frame so the answer is 'yes'.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 1,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No direct quotes with framing language.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 2,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No direct quotes with framing language.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 3,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No direct quotes with framing language.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 4,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Attribution to CDC, not a direct quote with framing language.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 5,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No direct quotes with framing language.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 6,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No direct quotes with framing language.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 7,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No direct quotes with framing language.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 8,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Attribution to Kentucky officials, not a direct quote with framing language.

{"Q": 12, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "No explicit framing cues found. Factual report of actions ('banning or limiting poultry imports') and reason ('following the disease outbreak'). Defaults to Neutral.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segment Framing: Defaulting to Neutral**\n\nMy analysis begins at the culmination of a 12-step decision tree, specifically at Q12, the final check. Having navigated the preceding questions (Q1-Q11), I've determined that none of the text segments contain the specific alarmist or reassuring cues – such as intensifiers, vivid verbs, or explicit calming language – that would trigger an alternative frame. My task at this stage is to assess whether the information, regardless of its objective nature (positive or negative), is presented in a purely factual, descriptive, or technical manner, warranting a \"Neutral\" classification.\n\nI have meticulously reviewed each of the ten text segments, employing a structured approach that centers on identifying factual reporting or the use of technical language:\n\n*   **Segment 1 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_11\\_1001\\_chunk0):** The segment presents a straightforward fact about the rarity of human infection and the possibility after close contact, using descriptive terms rather than framing language. The reporting is factual and descriptive, resulting in a \"Neutral\" classification.\n*   **Segment 2 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_1\\_1\\_chunk0):** The segment reports a specific event and statistics, using factual language. The segment uses terms like \"deaths,\" \"poultry farms,\" and \"borders,\" which are not designed to create a strong emotional response. As such, the segment is classified as \"Neutral\".\n*   **Segment 3 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_013\\_1003\\_chunk0):** This segment reports a hypothesis and an observation. The language is factual and neutral, thus fitting the \"Neutral\" frame.\n*   **Segment 4 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_16\\_1002\\_chunk0):** The segment presents historical information and a hypothesis in a factual, descriptive manner. Even terms like \"large outbreaks\" and \"spread\" are used in a descriptive context. Therefore, this segment is classified as \"Neutral\".\n*   **Segment 5 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_3\\_100\\_chunk0):** The segment reports the location of recent cases using factual language, fitting the \"Neutral\" frame.\n*   **Segment 6 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_002\\_1003\\_chunk0):** The segment reports a consequence with factual language like \"triggered\" and \"blocking.\" The reported events do not contain framing cues. This is a \"Neutral\" segment.\n*   **Segment 7 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_003\\_1003\\_chunk0):** The segment reports an action and the reason for the action using factual language. The segment does not use framing cues. This is a \"Neutral\" segment.\n*   **Segment 8 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_004\\_1003\\_chunk0):** This segment reports a factual finding using technical language. The term \"highly pathogenic\" is explicitly marked as a technical term guard, indicating neutrality, and there are no other framing cues. This segment defaults to \"Neutral\".\n*   **Segment 9 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_12\\_1000\\_chunk0):** This segment reports the actions taken by countries and the cause. As such, it is presented in a neutral fashion. This is a \"Neutral\" segment.\n*   **Segment 10 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_1\\_1002\\_chunk0):** This segment reports factual findings using factual language. It warrants a \"Neutral\" classification.\n\nIn conclusion, after a detailed examination of each segment against the specific framing cues established by the preceding questions, I've concluded that all ten segments align with the \"Factual Reporting\" pattern, with one also showing \"Technical Description\". There are no other cues to trigger Q1-Q11. As a result, the \"Neutral\" frame is the appropriate classification for all the analyzed text segments.\n"}
