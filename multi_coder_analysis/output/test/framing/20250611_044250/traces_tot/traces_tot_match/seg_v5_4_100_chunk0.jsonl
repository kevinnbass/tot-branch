{"Q": 1, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "The intensifier 'so' modifies the risk-adjective 'infectious'.", "thoughts": "**My Q1 Evaluation of the Text Segments**\n\nAlright, I've been tasked with applying the first question (Q1) of a 12-step decision tree to a series of text segments. The goal is to identify segments that exhibit an \"Alarmist\" frame based solely on the presence of intensifiers or comparatives modifying risk-adjectives, or the fixed idiom \"deadly from the start/outset.\" For this task, I *only* need to analyze each segment against these specific criteria.\n\nMy thinking went like this: I carefully reviewed each segment, looking for the telltale signs of Q1. In each case, I applied my expertise to ensure that the criteria were met. In almost all instances, it was fairly straightforward. I quickly discarded the segments that focused on scale (\"millions,\" \"large outbreaks\"), technical descriptions, or simple statements about safety. However, Segment 8 caught my attention. It contained the phrase \"so infectious,\" and while \"deadly\" also appeared, it wasn't intensified. Still, the instruction was clear: *any* match is sufficient.  The presence of the intensifier \"so\" modifying the risk-adjective \"infectious\" triggered an Alarmist frame.\n\nIn summary, out of the 10 segments, only one, Segment 8, met the criteria for an \"Alarmist\" frame based on Q1. I've documented my decisions and rationales carefully, and I'm ready to present the findings in the required JSON format.\n"}
