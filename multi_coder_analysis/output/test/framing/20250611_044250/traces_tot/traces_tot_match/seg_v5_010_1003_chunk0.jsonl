{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain an intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segments for Alarmist Framing (Q1)**\n\nMy task was to act as an expert claim-framing coder, analyzing each text segment against a 12-step decision tree, starting with Q1. This initial question focuses on identifying intensifiers or comparative adjectives directly modifying risk-adjectives within each segment.  My analysis strictly adhered to the provided rules, examples, the Bedrock Principle (code presentation only), the Symmetry Rule, and the Precedence Ladder (Q1 priority). The \"Technical-term guard\" was absolute.\n\nFor each segment, I meticulously examined the text, looking for instances of intensifiers (e.g., \"so,\" \"very\") or comparatives (e.g., \"more,\" \"deadlier\") preceding risk-adjectives (e.g., \"deadly,\" \"dangerous\").  I also checked the provided pattern recognition table, detailed rules, and regex patterns for confirmation, documenting my rationale for each \"yes\" or \"no\" decision. The goal was to identify if an alarmist frame, signaled by modified risk-adjectives, was present.  Based on my comprehensive analysis, none of the text segments met the criteria for an \"Alarmist\" frame according to the initial Q1 test.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 1,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 2,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 3,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 4,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 5,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 6,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 7,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 8,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 9,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 10,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No intensifier or comparative modifying a risk-adjective.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'expect' is not a high-potency verb according to the Q2 criteria.", "thoughts": "**Processing Text Segments for Alarmist Framing**\n\nOkay, I've been tasked with analyzing ten text segments to identify instances of \"Alarmist\" framing, specifically based on Q2 of the decision tree. My goal is to determine if each segment contains high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative nouns, or the phrase \"on high alert\" (paired with a threat word).  I need to provide a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer for each segment, along with the rationale and the specific cue if applicable, and I need to output a single JSON array with the segment ID, answer, and rationale.\n\nHere's how I went through each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:**  I looked for any alarmist signals. The verbs \"triggered\" and \"blocking\" weren't high-potency. No metaphors, superlative + negative combinations, or the phrase \"on high alert\" appeared. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 2:** I scanned for the alarmist triggers.  The verb \"limited\" wasn't high-potency. No other signs of alarmist framing were present. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 3:**  Again, I scanned for any framing cues and \"infected\", which is the only verb, is not high-potency.  \"Highly pathogenic avian flu\" is a technical term, not a potent metaphor or phrase. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 4:**  I checked for the four alarmist categories and only saw \"culled\" and \"enter\", neither of which are high-potency verbs. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 5:**  I ran through the segment and found the verbs, working, prevent, spreading, heightening, but none were considered high-potency verbs for alarmist framing, and no other Q2 cues were present. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 6:**  Here, I looked for my cues. The verbs I saw (\"expected\", \"lower\", \"raise\") were not high-potency. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 7:** I looked for alarmist framing, and found nothing. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 8:**  The only verb was \"expect,\" so the answer is no. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 9:** I scrutinized this segment but found no alarmist framing indicators. Answer: No.\n*   **Segment 10:**  There are verbs in this segment, but none are high-potency. Answer: No.\n\nSince none of the segments exhibited any of the \"Alarmist\" framing markers I was looking for, my final output will be a JSON array containing \"no\" for each segment. I'm ready to generate the JSON array.\n"}
{"Q": 4, "answer": "no", "rationale": "No loaded rhetorical question designed to imply alarm is present in the text.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for Alarmist Rhetoric (Q4)**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've been tasked with acting as a claim-framing expert, applying a 12-step decision tree, specifically focusing on Step Q4: Loaded Rhetorical Question for Alarm. My mission is to meticulously examine a series of text segments, determine if they contain a loaded rhetorical question that's designed to instill fear or urgency. I'll flag anything that meets that criteria.\n\nMy current focus is on detecting questions that are explicitly loaded or emotionally charged, clearly intended to imply an alarmist frame. This means I'm looking for questions that go beyond neutral information-seeking and instead aim to trigger concern about a worrisome threat.\n\nI've carefully reviewed each segment, and it's pretty clear cut. *None* of them contain any questions, let alone the kind I'm looking for. Based on my analysis and applying the Q4 criteria, the answer for all the text segments is a resounding \"no.\"  The rationale is straightforward: no loaded rhetorical questions implying alarm were identified in any of the segments. This was a pretty quick evaluation because there were no questions present.\n"}
{"Q": 6, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment does not contain a minimiser combined with a scale contrast.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Reassuring Frames - Q6: Minimiser + Scale Contrast**\n\nMy task was to apply a very specific rule – looking for a \"minimiser\" (like 'only' or 'few') *combined with* a \"scale contrast\" (like 'among millions' or 'thousands of farms') – within these text segments to identify reassuring frames. This specific combination is part of my 12-step decision tree for evaluating claims.\n\nAnalyzing each segment, I carefully checked for the presence of both minimisers and scale contrasts. While some segments contained scale contrasts (e.g., \"thousands of farms\"), none of them used a minimiser in conjunction with the scale contrast to create the desired reassuring frame.  Therefore, after reviewing all segments against the criteria for Q6, I found that *none* of them met the requirements. My analysis concluded \"no\" for all segments.\n"}
{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "Segment does not contain a bare negation.", "thoughts": "**Analysis of Text Segments for Bare Negation (Q7)**\n\nMy task is to meticulously evaluate each text segment against the criteria for \"Bare Negation without Explicit Calming Cue\" (Q7) within a 12-step decision tree for claim framing. I need to apply the rule: Does the segment contain a bare negation (like 'not expected', 'unlikely') WITHOUT an explicit calming cue framing the negation as reassuring? If YES, the frame is Neutral, and I must output JSON. If NO, the analysis would proceed to Q8 (which is not relevant for this step, however).\n\nI've carefully analyzed each of the ten segments provided:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8 would be the next step, but that's beyond my scope.\n*   **Segment 2:** The phrase \"will not enter the food system\" is a clear bare negation, with no accompanying calming cue. Therefore, the answer is YES, and the frame is Neutral.\n*   **Segment 3:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n*   **Segment 4:** The phrase \"is not expected to lower overall chicken production levels\" constitutes a bare negation without a calming cue. This triggers a YES answer, and a Neutral frame.\n*   **Segment 5:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n*   **Segment 6:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n*   **Segment 7:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n*   **Segment 8:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n*   **Segment 9:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n*   **Segment 10:** No bare negation found. Proceeding to Q8.\n\nTherefore, my final JSON output, correctly formatted and in accordance with the specifications, is:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_004_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_006_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"'will not enter the food system' is a bare negation without additional calming language.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_007_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_008_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"'is not expected to lower overall chicken production levels' is a bare negation without additional calming language.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_009_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_010_1003_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_11_1000_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_12_1000_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_13_1000_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_14_1000_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Segment does not contain a bare negation.\"\n  }\n]\n```\nThe analysis is now complete. The segments identified as \"YES\" for the bare negation rule (2 and 4) are ready for further framing steps, but this concludes Q7. All other segments would proceed to the next stage of the decision tree.\n"}
{"Q": 8, "answer": "yes", "rationale": "Describes a preparedness/response action ('expect final test results') without explicit reassurance.", "thoughts": "**My Analysis of the Segments Through the Q8 Lens**\n\nOkay, so the task is to apply Q8 of this decision tree to ten segments of text. Q8 is all about identifying segments that describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards *without* explicitly linking them to present calm, safety, or minimized risk. If it's a \"yes,\" then it's Neutral according to Q8. If not, we move on. Simple enough in concept, but each segment requires careful consideration.\n\nLet's break down my thought process for each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** This is straightforward. The segment details a safeguard (cooking kills bacteria), but it doesn't reassure about *current* safety. So, it's a \"yes\" to Q8. I'll quote the safeguard in my rationale.\n*   **Segments 2-4 & 9:** These are all clearly describing negative events like export restrictions or outbreaks. Q8 doesn't apply; it's not about safeguards, capabilities, or hopeful possibilities. These are \"no\" answers.\n*   **Segment 5:** This is a bit more nuanced. It highlights Tyson's actions to prevent spread and heighten safety measures. These are definitely preparedness measures. The crucial point: it doesn't *explicitly* reassure the audience about present safety. So, \"yes\" to Q8. The decisive cues are the phrases about *preventing the spread* and *heightening safety*.\n*   **Segment 6:** This looks like it *should* be Reassuring because it's a direct statement of safety. However, I'm specifically evaluating Q8, which is about capability/preparedness *without* reassurance. Since it directly assures safety, Q8's criteria aren't met. So, \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 7:** This focuses on expectations about *future* test results. It's related to the response plan, which includes surveillance, and testing. It's a preparedness action, and crucially, it doesn't reassure the audience about immediate safety. So it is a \"yes.\" I'll quote the decisive cue, the expectation of \"final test results.\"\n*   **Segment 8:** This is a mix of recommendations and statements about ongoing response plans. Both parts fall under preparedness. It doesn't calm the reader by saying the situation is under control, so Q8 is a \"yes.\" The rationale needs to cover the recommendation and the description of the response plan, quoting the key phrases of each.\n*   **Segment 10:** This is purely an economic fact. It has nothing to do with safeguards, preparedness, or reassurances. Therefore, \"no.\"\n\nNow that I've carefully analyzed each segment against the Q8 pattern, I'm ready to create the JSON array. The key here is to accurately and concisely explain *why* each segment is a \"yes\" or a \"no\" based on the specific criteria of Q8. This is where expertise comes in: recognizing the nuances of language and how it relates to risk communication.\n"}
