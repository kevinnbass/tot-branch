I've taken the user's instructions to heart and am acting as a claim-framing coder, focusing specifically on identifying intensification or comparative language related to risk adjectives, or the idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\" within the provided text. My core function is to assess whether each segment exhibits the specific Q1 pattern outlined in the instructions.\n\nI've meticulously reviewed each segment, applying the defined criteria and guardrails. Specifically, I've looked for:\n\n*   Intensifiers (like \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.) modifying risk adjectives (like \"dangerous\", \"lethal\", etc.)\n*   Comparatives (like \"more\", \"deadlier\", etc.) modifying risk adjectives.\n*   The phrase \"deadly from the start/outset\".\n\nI've also made sure to respect the provided exceptions: ignoring \"highly pathogenic\" when it refers to a specific disease type and disregarding \"volatile\" in an economic context. I've been careful to separate factual reporting from any framing that meets the specified Q1 pattern.\n\nMy analysis of each segment confirms: *none* of the provided text segments contain the specific Q1 pattern I'm looking for. All segments are largely factual reports, descriptions of events, or economic data, without the specified intensifiers, comparatives, or idiom.

Essentially, I'm looking for instances where the author or a quoted source uses language that heightens the perceived impact or threat related to avian flu. This involves identifying \"high-potency verbs\" or \"potent metaphors,\" as defined by the Q2 guidelines and my expert understanding of nuanced language use in technical and public health contexts.\n\nI've carefully examined each segment, considering both the Q2 table of examples and the provided regex pattern.  For each segment, I've considered:\n\n*   **Verbs:** I've scrutinized the verbs for high-potency framing, such as verbs that sensationalize the impact of the event (e.g., \"devastated,\" \"ravaged,\" \"crippled\"). I noted that verbs describing actions directly, like \"culled\" or \"killed,\" are generally factual, not framing.\n*   **Metaphors:** I looked for any metaphors that might exaggerate the situation or paint a particularly dire picture.\n*   **Superlative + Negative Noun combinations:** I considered the presence of phrases that amplified the negativity (e.g., \"worst outbreak,\" \"deadliest strain\").\n*   **Critical Alert Phrases:** I kept an eye out for phrases that signal heightened concern or immediate threat, as per the rules and examples.\n*   **Regex Check:** Finally, I cross-checked each segment against the regex to confirm the presence of high-potency language.\n\nHere's my breakdown:\n\n*   **Segments 1-7, 9-10:**  Based on my analysis and the Q2 rules, I concluded that these segments *did not* meet the criteria for Q2. None employed the requisite high-potency verbs or potent metaphors. Technical terms, like \"highly pathogenic,\" were excluded per the guard rails.\n*   **Segment 8:** This segment stood out. While most of the verbs were factual, it included the phrase \"**on high alert**\" followed within the permissible character range by \"bird flu outbreak.\" This critical alert phrase, in this context, strongly suggested framing designed to heighten the perceived risk, thereby triggering a positive Q2 response.\n\nThe final output is structured as a JSON array, with each object representing a segment and detailing my assessment:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 1,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 2,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 3,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 4,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 5,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 6,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 7,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 8,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Contains critical alert phrase: \\\"on high alert\\\" in proximity to outbreak mention.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 9,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 10,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The verb 'are dealing' is not a moderate verb listed for Q3.", "thoughts": "**Q3 Evaluation - Avian Flu Text Segments**\n\nAlright, let's get down to business. I've been tasked with applying the Q3 rule to this collection of text segments concerning avian flu. The core of this analysis is pinpointing instances where the author uses a \"moderate verb\" - verbs like \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" or \"plummeted\" - AND explicitly pairs it with information detailing significant scale or impact. It's about verbs that describe a *realised* impact, not just a plan or potential.\n\nFirst, I need to check each segment against the specific list of moderate verbs and scale indicators. Those verbs are my starting point, and I'll be looking for how they are used within their context. I'll need to remember the specific rules that have been set to guide the process.\n\nLet's dive into the segments:\n\n*   **Segment 1**: The first segment highlights a situation where 29,000 turkeys were euthanized. While the number might seem significant, the Q3 rule, as I understand it, requires an *explicit large-scale impact*, like \"millions.\" Additionally, the verb \"had to euthanize\" is a passive form and it's not present in the Q3 rule. Thus, it's not a Q3 match.\n*   **Segment 2**: Here, we have \"have tested positive\". This phrase doesn't align with the moderate verbs the rule specifies. So, no match.\n*   **Segment 3**: This segment mentions the fact that avian flu \"does not cause\" symptoms in wild birds, but \"can be\" deadly in domestic poultry. The key verbs here aren't on the list of \"moderate verbs.\" No match.\n*   **Segment 4**: The segment notes that officials were \"forcing\" a cull. The verb \"to cull\" is excluded because it's an infinitive form and doesn't explicitly meet the requirements. It falls under the umbrella of future or ongoing action, which is not what the Q3 rule is looking for. No match here either.\n*   **Segment 5**: In this segment, the backyard flock \"had to be culled\". Again, the passive nature of \"had to be culled\" doesn't fit the Q3 criteria and would be considered an exclusion.\n*   **Segment 6**: \"To depopulate\" is an action, not an impact. While depopulating may describe the impact, it's not describing it with a verb. This is also an infinitive, and it fails to meet the specified criteria.\n*   **Segment 7**: The fact that test results \"are pending\" isn't a match. This is neutral and is not an impact verb.\n*   **Segment 8**: The key verb here is \"culled\" used as an adjective, and \"will not enter,\" which is future-based. Neither matches the Q3 criteria.\n*   **Segment 9**: The focus here is on rising prices. While the price increase is notable, the verb \"rising\" doesn't quite fit the criteria for a moderate verb, and isn't on the list.\n*   **Segment 10**: The segment explains that poultry farms \"are also dealing\" with the flu. This is neutral. No match.\n\nIn conclusion, after a meticulous review of all ten segments, none of them meet the Q3 criteria. Each segment failed to match because of the verb, its use, or the scale. My output will be a JSON array representing these results.\n"}

I am currently focusing on Q7, specifically looking for \"bare negations\" – statements that convey a lack of something – without any accompanying calming cues.\n\nFor each segment, I checked if it contained a bare negation (e.g., \"does not cause,\" \"will not enter\"). If a bare negation *was* present *without* a calming cue, the answer for Q7 is \"yes,\" and the frame is \"Neutral.\" If a bare negation was present *with* a calming cue, the answer would be \"no\" (proceeding to other cues), as I'm looking to identify *explicit* reassuring cues, and these text segments are just stating a lack of an event. I must provide a JSON array containing the results, with each entry indicating whether the segment met the criteria for a bare negation without calming and providing a rationale for my decision.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** The segment begins with \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms...\" The phrase \"does not cause any symptoms\" is a bare negation. There is no accompanying calming language. I determined the answer is \"yes,\" and assigned the rationale: \"'does not cause any symptoms' is a bare negation without explicit calming.\"\n*   **Segment 2:** This segment describes an event, not a bare negation, so Q7 did not apply, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes events and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 3:** Similar to Segment 2, this segment details events, not a bare negation. Q7: \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes events and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 4:** This segment describes an action, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes actions and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 5:** This states a status, not a bare negation. Q7: \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment states the status of test results and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 6:** This segment contains \"will not enter the food system,\" which is a bare negation. There is no accompanying calming cue. Therefore the answer is \"yes,\" rationale: \"'will not enter the food system' is a bare negation without explicit calming.\"\n*   **Segment 7:** This segment reports statistical data, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment reports statistical data and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 8:** This segment states a fact about other regions, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment states a fact about other regions and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 9:** This segment describes events, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes events and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 10:** This segment details a situation. Answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes events and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n\nTherefore the segments that met the criteria for bare negations without calming cues were segments 1 and 6, where the frame is \"Neutral.\" The other segments did not contain the criteria to satisfy Q7.\n"}

Here, \"high risk\" *precedes* the technical term. \"High risk\" is clearly presented as an assessment, intensified by \"definitely.\" I'm not evaluating the term \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\" itself; I'm looking at the *assessment* of risk. This sets off an alarm. It's a risk adjective, strengthened by the intensifier. No authorial counter-framing is present. The quote presents a clear, dominant Alarmist frame.

The key is to look for neutral language, technical terms, and straightforward presentation of facts, even if those facts are severe.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 1,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Reports factual detection using neutral language; no alarmist or reassuring cues.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 2,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Reports facts factually, includes technical terms; no intensifiers or calming language.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 3,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Presents factual information using neutral language; no added framing.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 4,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Provides factual timeline and locations in a neutral, descriptive manner.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 5,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Factual reporting of surveillance results and spread, no framing.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 6,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Reports severe facts (euthanization) factually, without alarmist framing.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 7,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Describes testing results and locations factually; 'dozens' isn't amplified.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 8,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Reports the status of the testing process factually, using neutral terms.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 9,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Reports locations affected by avian flu factually; 'dealing with' is not vivid.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 10,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Provides factual data on farm numbers and location; no emotional language.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAll the segments align with a \"Neutral\" frame under Q12.\n"}
