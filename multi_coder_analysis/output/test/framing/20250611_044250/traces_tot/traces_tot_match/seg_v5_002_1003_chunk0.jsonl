I need to provide a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer for each segment, along with the rationale and the specific cue if applicable, and I need to output a single JSON array with the segment ID, answer, and rationale.\n\nHere's how I went through each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:**  I looked for any alarmist signals. The verbs \"triggered\" and \"blocking\" weren't high-potency. No metaphors, superlative + negative combinations, or the phrase \"on high alert\" appeared.

I've got my checklist: look for verbs like `hit`, `swept`, `surged`, `soared`, `plunged`, `plummeted`, `prompted`, `feared`, `fearing`, or `were/was culled` (but only if it's a *completed* action), and make sure they're describing something with significant scale (like \"millions,\" \"thousands,\" \"record,\" or \"devastating\"). Plain verbs like `killed`, `died`, and `affected` are out unless they're explicitly tied to significant scale.\n\nSo, let's dive in, segment by segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** The word `triggered` is a possible cause-and-effect verb but isn't on the Q3 list, and although restrictions are indicated, it doesn't meet the criteria. `No`\n*   **Segment 2:** The verb `limited` is a restriction, but not on the Q3 list, and doesn't meet the criteria. `No`\n*   **Segment 3:** The verb `were infected` is a plain outcome, not describing an impact. `No`\n*   **Segment 4:** The verb `will be culled` is in the regex, but it's a future/plan, not a realized action, and there's no specific scale. `No`\n*   **Segment 5:** No verbs here meet the criteria. `No`\n*   **Segment 6:** No Q3 verbs. Although there's scale, the verbs are used in the context of *lack* of impact. `No`\n*   **Segment 7:** A statement about product safety. Not relevant to Q3. `No`\n*   **Segment 8:** The verb `expect` doesn't fit the criteria. `No`\n*   **Segment 9:** No suitable verbs here, the scale information is about the scope of surveillance, not impact. `No`\n*   **Segment 10:** No Q3 verbs, scale is about the scope of an action, not the disease impact. `No`\n\nSo, after carefully applying the Q3 criteria, it looks like none of these segments contain a Q3 cue.

Q8 is all about identifying segments that describe capabilities, preparedness, hopeful possibilities, or safeguards *without* explicitly linking them to present calm, safety, or minimized risk. If it's a \"yes,\" then it's Neutral according to Q8. If not, we move on. Simple enough in concept, but each segment requires careful consideration.\n\nLet's break down my thought process for each segment:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** This is straightforward. The segment details a safeguard (cooking kills bacteria), but it doesn't reassure about *current* safety. So, it's a \"yes\" to Q8. I'll quote the safeguard in my rationale.\n*   **Segments 2-4 & 9:** These are all clearly describing negative events like export restrictions or outbreaks. Q8 doesn't apply; it's not about safeguards, capabilities, or hopeful possibilities. These are \"no\" answers.\n*   **Segment 5:** This is a bit more nuanced. It highlights Tyson's actions to prevent spread and heighten safety measures. These are definitely preparedness measures. The crucial point: it doesn't *explicitly* reassure the audience about present safety. So, \"yes\" to Q8. The decisive cues are the phrases about *preventing the spread* and *heightening safety*.\n*   **Segment 6:** This looks like it *should* be Reassuring because it's a direct statement of safety. However, I'm specifically evaluating Q8, which is about capability/preparedness *without* reassurance. Since it directly assures safety, Q8's criteria aren't met. So, \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 7:** This focuses on expectations about *future* test results. It's related to the response plan, which includes surveillance, and testing. It's a preparedness action, and crucially, it doesn't reassure the audience about immediate safety. So it is a \"yes.\" I'll quote the decisive cue, the expectation of \"final test results.\"\n*   **Segment 8:** This is a mix of recommendations and statements about ongoing response plans. Both parts fall under preparedness. It doesn't calm the reader by saying the situation is under control, so Q8 is a \"yes.\" The rationale needs to cover the recommendation and the description of the response plan, quoting the key phrases of each.\n*   **Segment 10:** This is purely an economic fact. It has nothing to do with safeguards, preparedness, or reassurances. Therefore, \"no.\"\n\nNow that I've carefully analyzed each segment against the Q8 pattern, I'm ready to create the JSON array. The key here is to accurately and concisely explain *why* each segment is a \"yes\" or a \"no\" based on the specific criteria of Q8.

Presents numerical information (\"millions of fowl\") with neutral verbs.\n*   **Segment 6:** \"The latest cases were at a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County.\" - **No**. Provides location details, not economic data in the sense required by Q9.\n*   **Segment 7:** \"Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky.\" - **No**. Describes actions and consequences (restrictions, blocking) but doesn't report specific prices or data points.\n*   **Segment 8:** \"Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there.\" - **No**.

The presence of any optimistic or forward-looking language is the key indicator here.\n\n*   **Segment 1 through 10:** In each case, my analysis landed on \"no\" for Q10. The segments predominantly describe the current situation regarding bird flu, report past events, or mention consequences of the outbreak. There's no speculation about future improvement or relief.

I have to be incredibly precise, especially with the subtle nuances of language.\n\nFirst, I scour each segment for direct quotes. If I find one, I meticulously analyze it, looking for framing language – specifically, explicit Alarmist or Reassuring cues. I have to keep in mind, of course, that certain technical terms, like \"highly pathogenic avian,\" are guarded and don't automatically trigger an alarmist response. It's about context, the specific wording, and whether it's clearly framing the information.\n\nIf a direct quote *does* present a dominant frame (either Alarmist or Reassuring), I mark it as a \"yes\" for Q11, state the frame I see, and provide a rationale that includes that key piece of evidence.

This segment defaults to \"Neutral\".\n*   **Segment 9 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_12\\_1000\\_chunk0):** This segment reports the actions taken by countries and the cause. As such, it is presented in a neutral fashion. This is a \"Neutral\" segment.\n*   **Segment 10 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_1\\_1002\\_chunk0):** This segment reports factual findings using factual language. It warrants a \"Neutral\" classification.\n\nIn conclusion, after a detailed examination of each segment against the specific framing cues established by the preceding questions, I've concluded that all ten segments align with the \"Factual Reporting\" pattern, with one also showing \"Technical Description\". There are no other cues to trigger Q1-Q11. As a result, the \"Neutral\" frame is the appropriate classification for all the analyzed text segments.\n"}
