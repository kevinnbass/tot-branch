I also checked the provided pattern recognition table, detailed rules, and regex patterns for confirmation, documenting my rationale for each \"yes\" or \"no\" decision.

I looked for verbs that vividly portray a severe impact or metaphorical language that amplifies the potential threat.  I considered phrases like 'plummeted', 'skyrocketed' as clear examples, and I compared other verbs against those. My analysis led me to consistently answer \"no\" to Q2 for all segments.

No moderate verbs, and nothing about impact tied to one, so it's a \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 2:** Same as Segment 1. No moderate verbs, no impact. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 3:** Ah, here we have \"hitting\". It's a moderate verb, but is it explicitly tied to scale or impact? I'm not convinced. The segment describes how outbreaks are happening *at a time when* supplies have dropped, but it's not the verb describing the *impact* of those outbreaks.  Also, it's present continuous tense. By the definition in the patterns, \"are hitting\" should fall to Neutral. So, it's a \"no.\"\n*   **Segment 4:**  Impact in terms of percentage drops, but no moderate verb to pair it with. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 5:**  No moderate verbs, just \"was found.\" \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 6:**  Same as Segment 5. \"Was detected,\" not a moderate verb. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 7:**  Again, no moderate verbs. Just factual language. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 8:**  \"Have been detected.\"  Not a moderate verb, no impact related to one. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 9:**  No moderate verbs, just a factual statement about safety. \"No.\"\n*   **Segment 10:**  \"Were infected.\" Not a moderate verb, and the mention of \"highly pathogenic avian flu\" is a technical term that doesn't count as an intensifier. \"No.\"\n\nIn conclusion, none of the segments meet the precise requirements of Q3.

I've got to carefully sift through each text segment to determine if it contains such a cue, as defined by the provided rules and patterns.\n\nMy process is straightforward: I'll meticulously analyze each segment. If I identify an *explicit* calming cue (like a direct statement of safety or control), I'll answer \"yes\" and pinpoint the cue in the rationale. If not, the answer is \"no\". It's a binary choice. I'll be strictly adhering to the Bedrock Principle, Symmetry Rule, Context Guard, Precedence Ladder, and the Mandatory Step-by-Step Decision Process, and I'll be sure to pass the 6-point self-audit.\n\nLet's break it down, segment by segment, with the Bedrock Principle front and center:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** This segment reports on production and export volume. It's purely factual. **No** explicit calming cue.\n*   **Segment 2:** This talks about working \"diligently\" to prevent disease spread. However, \"working diligently\" is a statement about *action* not about safety for the public or consumers, which is a key part of the Q5 rule. **No** explicit calming cue.\n*   **Segment 3:** It's just describing a negative backdrop. **No** explicit calming cue.\n*   **Segment 4:** This segment simply presents negative facts on supply levels. **No** explicit calming cue.\n*   **Segment 5 & 6:** These segments present the date and location of detection. **No** explicit calming cue.\n*   **Segment 7:** The quote states that detections \"do not present an immediate public health concern.\" This is a bare negation, which the rule defines as neutral. **No** explicit calming cue.\n*   **Segment 8:** This is a bare positive fact about the absence of human cases. The Q5 pattern table lists \"no cases reported\" as a bare positive fact, and thus as neutral. **No** explicit calming cue.\n*   **Segment 9:** This provides safe food handling instructions. This is informative, not directly reassuring about the *current* safety of the *situation*. **No** explicit calming cue.\n*   **Segment 10:** It provides technical details about the strain and location. It's the technical term \"highly pathogenic avian flu\" so it's ignored by the technical-term guard. **No** explicit calming cue.\n\nAfter this comprehensive review, based on the Q5 rules, it is clear that *none* of these segments contain the specific explicit calming cues that Q5 is looking for.\n\nI'm now ready to provide the output in the requested JSON format.

I've received a set of text segments and need to evaluate each one for the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern, which is a key element of the Reassuring framing category. Specifically, I'm at step Q6 of the decision tree.\n\nMy process involved meticulously examining each segment for the presence of two critical components: a minimizing word (like \"only,\" \"just,\" \"merely,\" \"a single,\" or \"few\") *and* an explicit or implicitly implied contrasting scale or context that provides a broader perspective (something like \"out of thousands,\" \"among millions,\" \"nationwide,\" etc.). Both must be present and working together to downplay the significance of the event or information. Importantly, a lone number like \"1\" or \"one\" doesn't qualify as a minimizer unless it's preceded by a minimizer token.\n\nI've carefully read through each of the ten segments provided, and the results are clear. I've systematically checked for the required elements in each:\n\n*   **Segment 1-10:** None of the segments contained the specific \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern. I looked for the minimiser tokens and the contrasting scale, but they were absent in all cases. I also considered related clues like calming statements or bare negations, but these would trigger other questions in the decision tree (Q5 and Q7), not the current focus on Q6.\n\nTherefore, my final assessment is that for all ten segments, the answer to Q6 is \"no.\"  I did not find the \"Minimiser + Scale Contrast\" pattern in any of the provided text.\n"}

Essentially, I'm looking for phrases that use negation (like \"not\", \"no\", \"unlikely\") *without* immediately following up with a phrase that reassures the audience (like \"don't worry,\" \"risk is minimal\"). Remember, I'm only dealing with Q7 here, so I'm not looking ahead at other aspects of the decision tree.\n\nI've carefully examined each segment:\n\n*   **Segments 1-4, 7-10:** I immediately classified these as \"no\" for Q7 because they didn't contain any instances of bare negation, or because the negation was followed by reassurances which place it in the frame of Q5/Q6.\n*   **Segment 5:** This one was a clear \"yes\". It had the phrase \"do not present an immediate public health concern,\" which fits the pattern perfectly. I need to make sure the rationale for this one quotes the phrase directly.\n*   **Segment 6:** Another \"yes\" here. The phrase, \"No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States,\" also indicates a bare negation without an immediate calming cue.

The phrase \"working 'diligently' to prevent the disease from spreading\" directly describes preparedness/response measures.  The language doesn't soothe the audience with explicit assurances, which fits the pattern. So, my rationale would center on this key phrase.\n*   **Segment 2:** This is a **no**. The segment sets the stage with the context of market supplies, which doesn't fit the specified criteria.\n*   **Segment 3:** This is also a **no**. It focuses on data, not active responses.\n*   **Segment 4:** This one is a **no** as well.  The agency's statement is factual, which doesn't fit the question's criteria.\n*   **Segment 5:** **No**. Again, it focuses on reporting rather than active measures.\n*   **Segment 6:** This is a **yes**. Reminding people about safe practices (proper handling and cooking) is a form of safeguard/preparedness. Although it doesn't give direct reassurance, it offers a form of protection. My rationale would reference \"proper handling and cooking... kills bacteria and viruses\".\n*   **Segment 7:** Another **no**. It provides technical and locational information.\n*   **Segment 8:** A definite **no**.

It warrants a \"Neutral\" classification.\n\nIn conclusion, after a detailed examination of each segment against the specific framing cues established by the preceding questions, I've concluded that all ten segments align with the \"Factual Reporting\" pattern, with one also showing \"Technical Description\". There are no other cues to trigger Q1-Q11. As a result, the \"Neutral\" frame is the appropriate classification for all the analyzed text segments.\n"}
