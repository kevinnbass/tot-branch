{"Q": 1, "answer": "no", "rationale": "'highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza' uses 'highly pathogenic' as a technical term for the strain type, not an authorial intensifier on a risk adjective.", "thoughts": "**Claim Framing Analysis: Q1 Evaluation**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of these text segments. I've taken the user's instructions to heart and am acting as a claim-framing coder, focusing specifically on identifying intensification or comparative language related to risk adjectives, or the idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\" within the provided text. My core function is to assess whether each segment exhibits the specific Q1 pattern outlined in the instructions.\n\nI've meticulously reviewed each segment, applying the defined criteria and guardrails. Specifically, I've looked for:\n\n*   Intensifiers (like \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.) modifying risk adjectives (like \"dangerous\", \"lethal\", etc.)\n*   Comparatives (like \"more\", \"deadlier\", etc.) modifying risk adjectives.\n*   The phrase \"deadly from the start/outset\".\n\nI've also made sure to respect the provided exceptions: ignoring \"highly pathogenic\" when it refers to a specific disease type and disregarding \"volatile\" in an economic context. I've been careful to separate factual reporting from any framing that meets the specified Q1 pattern.\n\nMy analysis of each segment confirms: *none* of the provided text segments contain the specific Q1 pattern I'm looking for. All segments are largely factual reports, descriptions of events, or economic data, without the specified intensifiers, comparatives, or idiom. I'm therefore responding with \"no\" to Q1 for each segment, accompanied by a brief rationale for the decision.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON output will contain a list of objects, each with the `segment_id`, `answer: \"no\"`, and a brief rationale confirming the absence of the Q1 pattern.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "No high-potency verbs or potent metaphors are used. 'highly pathogenic' is a technical term.", "thoughts": "**Analyzing Text Segments for High-Potency Framing**\n\nAs I understand it, my task is to apply the Q2 decision tree rule to a set of text segments.  Essentially, I'm looking for instances where the author or a quoted source uses language that heightens the perceived impact or threat related to avian flu. This involves identifying \"high-potency verbs\" or \"potent metaphors,\" as defined by the Q2 guidelines and my expert understanding of nuanced language use in technical and public health contexts.\n\nI've carefully examined each segment, considering both the Q2 table of examples and the provided regex pattern.  For each segment, I've considered:\n\n*   **Verbs:** I've scrutinized the verbs for high-potency framing, such as verbs that sensationalize the impact of the event (e.g., \"devastated,\" \"ravaged,\" \"crippled\"). I noted that verbs describing actions directly, like \"culled\" or \"killed,\" are generally factual, not framing.\n*   **Metaphors:** I looked for any metaphors that might exaggerate the situation or paint a particularly dire picture.\n*   **Superlative + Negative Noun combinations:** I considered the presence of phrases that amplified the negativity (e.g., \"worst outbreak,\" \"deadliest strain\").\n*   **Critical Alert Phrases:** I kept an eye out for phrases that signal heightened concern or immediate threat, as per the rules and examples.\n*   **Regex Check:** Finally, I cross-checked each segment against the regex to confirm the presence of high-potency language.\n\nHere's my breakdown:\n\n*   **Segments 1-7, 9-10:**  Based on my analysis and the Q2 rules, I concluded that these segments *did not* meet the criteria for Q2. None employed the requisite high-potency verbs or potent metaphors. Technical terms, like \"highly pathogenic,\" were excluded per the guard rails.\n*   **Segment 8:** This segment stood out. While most of the verbs were factual, it included the phrase \"**on high alert**\" followed within the permissible character range by \"bird flu outbreak.\" This critical alert phrase, in this context, strongly suggested framing designed to heighten the perceived risk, thereby triggering a positive Q2 response.\n\nThe final output is structured as a JSON array, with each object representing a segment and detailing my assessment:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 1,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 2,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 3,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 4,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 5,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 6,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 7,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 8,\n    \"answer\": \"yes\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Contains critical alert phrase: \\\"on high alert\\\" in proximity to outbreak mention.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 9,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": 10,\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No high-potency verb or potent metaphor found.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n"}
{"Q": 3, "answer": "no", "rationale": "No moderate verbs from the Q3 list are present.", "thoughts": "**Applying the Q3 Criteria to the Text Segments**\n\nOkay, I've got the task. The goal is to identify instances where a \"moderate verb\" indicating realised impact is paired with a clear indicator of scale or impact within each of the ten text segments. I'm focusing on the following \"moderate verbs\": `hit, swept, surged, soared, plunged, plummeted, prompted, feared, fearing, (were|was) culled`, excluding passive and future forms, and plain factual verbs like `killed`, `died`, and `affected`. Scale/impact indicators are numerical quantities, comparative terms, and strong impact descriptors.\n\nI went through each segment meticulously:\n\n*   **Segments 1-7:**  In the first seven segments, I didn't find any instances that matched the Q3 criteria. I looked for the specific moderate verbs, but the verbs present were not on the list, and in some, the future tense and passive structures ruled them out.\n*   **Segment 8:**  This one was tricky. While \"29,000\" indicated a quantity, the key verb, \"were killed,\" is explicitly excluded by the Q3 rule as a plain factual verb, despite the numerical scale.\n*   **Segments 9 & 10:**  Here, I spotted verbs like \"stop,\" \"learned,\" \"could rise,\" and \"could drop,\" but they fell short. They denote plans or speculative scenarios, rather than realized impact.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the text segments met the Q3 criteria. Thus, I'll return an array of JSON objects, each marking \"no\" and containing a brief rationale.\n"}

It's got to be both elements working together to soften the blow.\n\nI've gone through each segment meticulously, checking for that specific combination. Here's what I found:\n\n*   **Segment 1-10:**  None of the segments satisfied the Q6 criteria. None of them contain a minimiser combined with a scale contrast.

{"Q": 7, "answer": "no", "rationale": "The segment describes events and does not contain a bare negation.", "thoughts": "**Applying Q7: Identifying Bare Negations Without Calming Cues**\n\nAs an expert claim-framing coder, my task was to analyze several text segments related to avian flu, applying a 12-step decision tree. I am currently focusing on Q7, specifically looking for \"bare negations\" – statements that convey a lack of something – without any accompanying calming cues.\n\nFor each segment, I checked if it contained a bare negation (e.g., \"does not cause,\" \"will not enter\"). If a bare negation *was* present *without* a calming cue, the answer for Q7 is \"yes,\" and the frame is \"Neutral.\" If a bare negation was present *with* a calming cue, the answer would be \"no\" (proceeding to other cues), as I'm looking to identify *explicit* reassuring cues, and these text segments are just stating a lack of an event. I must provide a JSON array containing the results, with each entry indicating whether the segment met the criteria for a bare negation without calming and providing a rationale for my decision.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** The segment begins with \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms...\" The phrase \"does not cause any symptoms\" is a bare negation. There is no accompanying calming language. I determined the answer is \"yes,\" and assigned the rationale: \"'does not cause any symptoms' is a bare negation without explicit calming.\"\n*   **Segment 2:** This segment describes an event, not a bare negation, so Q7 did not apply, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes events and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 3:** Similar to Segment 2, this segment details events, not a bare negation. Q7: \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes events and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 4:** This segment describes an action, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes actions and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 5:** This states a status, not a bare negation. Q7: \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment states the status of test results and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 6:** This segment contains \"will not enter the food system,\" which is a bare negation. There is no accompanying calming cue. Therefore the answer is \"yes,\" rationale: \"'will not enter the food system' is a bare negation without explicit calming.\"\n*   **Segment 7:** This segment reports statistical data, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment reports statistical data and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 8:** This segment states a fact about other regions, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment states a fact about other regions and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 9:** This segment describes events, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes events and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 10:** This segment details a situation. Answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes events and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n\nTherefore the segments that met the criteria for bare negations without calming cues were segments 1 and 6, where the frame is \"Neutral.\" The other segments did not contain the criteria to satisfy Q7.\n"}

It describes an action taken by the authorities (tightened controls) which is a response, and does not provide an explicit link to reassurance.\n*   **Segment 8:** \"Another 34 farms are situated within a 10-kilometer (6 mile) radius of the infected location.\" - **Answer: No**. It's a factual statement about a geographical situation, not about capability or preparedness.\n*   **Segment 9:** \"Authorities banned the transport of any birds, eggs, manure, used straw and other animal products from the 10-kilometer ring around the infected farm.\" - **Answer: Yes**. It describes a safeguard (banning transport), without an explicit link to current calm or minimized risk.\n*   **Segment 10:** \"The new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana.\" - **Answer: No**. This indicates the cause of fear. It doesn't describe capability or preparedness.\n\nI am now ready to proceed to the next question for those segments where the answer to Q8 was \"No.\"\n"}
