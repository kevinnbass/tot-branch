I've taken the user's instructions to heart and am acting as a claim-framing coder, focusing specifically on identifying intensification or comparative language related to risk adjectives, or the idiom \"deadly from the start/outset\" within the provided text. My core function is to assess whether each segment exhibits the specific Q1 pattern outlined in the instructions.\n\nI've meticulously reviewed each segment, applying the defined criteria and guardrails. Specifically, I've looked for:\n\n*   Intensifiers (like \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.) modifying risk adjectives (like \"dangerous\", \"lethal\", etc.)\n*   Comparatives (like \"more\", \"deadlier\", etc.) modifying risk adjectives.\n*   The phrase \"deadly from the start/outset\".\n\nI've also made sure to respect the provided exceptions: ignoring \"highly pathogenic\" when it refers to a specific disease type and disregarding \"volatile\" in an economic context. I've been careful to separate factual reporting from any framing that meets the specified Q1 pattern.\n\nMy analysis of each segment confirms: *none* of the provided text segments contain the specific Q1 pattern I'm looking for. All segments are largely factual reports, descriptions of events, or economic data, without the specified intensifiers, comparatives, or idiom. I'm therefore responding with \"no\" to Q1 for each segment, accompanied by a brief rationale for the decision.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON output will contain a list of objects, each with the `segment_id`, `answer: \"no\"`, and a brief rationale confirming the absence of the Q1 pattern.\n"}
{"Q": 2, "answer": "no", "rationale": "No high-potency verb, potent metaphor, superlative-negative-noun, or 'on high alert' phrase is present. 'largest increase' does not use a negative noun.", "thoughts": "**Claim Framing Evaluation: Q2 Summary**\n\nOkay, I've got the task parameters clearly in mind. The instructions are to act as a claim-framing expert and focus *only* on the second step of a 12-step decision tree, which is to determine whether a given text segment contains specific alarm-triggering language. In this case, I'm looking for high-potency verbs, potent metaphors, superlative + negative noun phrases, or the phrase \"on high alert\" near a threat word. If any of those elements are present, the segment is framed as \"Alarmist\" *at this stage* (Q2). If not, it moves on. I am to output a JSON array of segment evaluations.\n\nLet's dive into the specifics of my analysis:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** This segment discusses preparedness efforts. While it uses the phrase \"fully prepared\", that is a cue related to *reassurance* (Q4) and is not a Q2 trigger. Therefore, no alarmist language is detected at this stage.\n\n*   **Segment 2:** This segment announces detections and euthanizations. While words like \"detected\" and \"euthanize\" are present, they are not high-potency verbs. Therefore, no alarmist language is detected at this stage.\n\n*   **Segments 3 & 4:** These segments discuss tests on wild birds and the impact on poultry. No alarmist language is detected at this stage.\n\n*   **Segment 5:** This segment discusses infection and attempts to stop the spread. While words like \"contracted\" and \"forcing\" are present, they are not high-potency verbs. Therefore, no alarmist language is detected at this stage.\n\n*   **Segment 6:** This segment describes culling in response to an outbreak. No alarmist language is detected at this stage.\n\n*   **Segment 7:** This segment describes depopulation in response to an outbreak. No alarmist language is detected at this stage.\n\n*   **Segment 8:** This segment mentions pending test results. No alarmist language is detected at this stage.\n\n*   **Segment 9:** This segment discusses culling and existing supply chain issues. While the word \"challenged\" is present, it is not a high-potency verb according to Q2 rules. No alarmist language is detected at this stage.\n\n*   **Segment 10:** This segment discusses price increases in relation to the outbreak. While it mentions the \"largest increase\", \"increase\" is not a negative noun in the sense of the Q2 rule, and \"rising\" describes a general condition rather than a direct threat. No alarmist language is detected at this stage.\n\nIn short, based on the specific criteria of Q2, none of the text segments contain the key alarmist indicators. So, I'm ready to produce the final JSON output, as requested.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_20_1005_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_1_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_2_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_3_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_4_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_5_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_6_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_7_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_8_1001_chunk0\",\n    \"answer\": \"no\",\n    \"rationale\": \"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_"}

I've been tasked with applying the Q3 rule to this collection of text segments concerning avian flu. The core of this analysis is pinpointing instances where the author uses a \"moderate verb\" - verbs like \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" or \"plummeted\" - AND explicitly pairs it with information detailing significant scale or impact. It's about verbs that describe a *realised* impact, not just a plan or potential.\n\nFirst, I need to check each segment against the specific list of moderate verbs and scale indicators. Those verbs are my starting point, and I'll be looking for how they are used within their context. I'll need to remember the specific rules that have been set to guide the process.\n\nLet's dive into the segments:\n\n*   **Segment 1**: The first segment highlights a situation where 29,000 turkeys were euthanized. While the number might seem significant, the Q3 rule, as I understand it, requires an *explicit large-scale impact*, like \"millions.\" Additionally, the verb \"had to euthanize\" is a passive form and it's not present in the Q3 rule. Thus, it's not a Q3 match.\n*   **Segment 2**: Here, we have \"have tested positive\". This phrase doesn't align with the moderate verbs the rule specifies. So, no match.\n*   **Segment 3**: This segment mentions the fact that avian flu \"does not cause\" symptoms in wild birds, but \"can be\" deadly in domestic poultry. The key verbs here aren't on the list of \"moderate verbs.\" No match.\n*   **Segment 4**: The segment notes that officials were \"forcing\" a cull. The verb \"to cull\" is excluded because it's an infinitive form and doesn't explicitly meet the requirements. It falls under the umbrella of future or ongoing action, which is not what the Q3 rule is looking for. No match here either.\n*   **Segment 5**: In this segment, the backyard flock \"had to be culled\". Again, the passive nature of \"had to be culled\" doesn't fit the Q3 criteria and would be considered an exclusion.\n*   **Segment 6**: \"To depopulate\" is an action, not an impact. While depopulating may describe the impact, it's not describing it with a verb. This is also an infinitive, and it fails to meet the specified criteria.\n*   **Segment 7**: The fact that test results \"are pending\" isn't a match. This is neutral and is not an impact verb.\n*   **Segment 8**: The key verb here is \"culled\" used as an adjective, and \"will not enter,\" which is future-based. Neither matches the Q3 criteria.\n*   **Segment 9**: The focus here is on rising prices. While the price increase is notable, the verb \"rising\" doesn't quite fit the criteria for a moderate verb, and isn't on the list.\n*   **Segment 10**: The segment explains that poultry farms \"are also dealing\" with the flu. This is neutral. No match.\n\nIn conclusion, after a meticulous review of all ten segments, none of them meet the Q3 criteria. Each segment failed to match because of the verb, its use, or the scale. My output will be a JSON array representing these results.\n"}

I'm specifically looking for questions that are posed by the author or a quoted source, use emotionally charged language, and are clearly intended to instill fear or urgency, not just to gather information.\n\nI've carefully examined each segment, one by one. I've been meticulous, making sure to consider the nuances of the language used and the potential intent behind the phrasing.  In this instance, I found absolutely no evidence of alarmist rhetorical questions in any of the ten provided text snippets.

I must adhere strictly to the information presented in the text segments and the provided rules: specifically, the Bedrock Principle (code the presentation, not the facts) and the Symmetry Rule.\n\nI've carefully reviewed each segment. My assessment revolves around looking for specific calming language like \"no cause for alarm,\" \"public can rest easy,\" \"fully under control,\" \"confident,\" \"risk is very low,\" \"excellent news,\" \"well protected,\" or preparedness specifically linked to public safety.  I'm *not* evaluating the actual risk; I'm evaluating the *presentation* of the information.\n\nHere's my conclusion:  **No. For every single segment, the answer is \"no.\"**  I did not find any of the specified explicit calming cues. The segments primarily report facts about avian flu outbreaks, detections, culling, and related economic information. While some segments mention potentially positive facts (e.g., birds won't enter the food system), they do so neutrally. They lack the *intensified* reassuring language that Q5 requires.\n\nTherefore, for each segment, my output will be a \"no\" answer, accompanied by a rationale that explicitly states the absence of the \"Explicit Calming Cue for Reassurance.\" I'm now ready to generate the JSON output as specified by the user.\n"}

This means I need to spot a minimiser (like \"only,\" \"just,\" or \"a few\") *alongside* an explicit or strongly implied scale contrast (like \"out of millions\" or \"nationwide\"). It's got to be both elements working together to soften the blow.\n\nI've gone through each segment meticulously, checking for that specific combination. Here's what I found:\n\n*   **Segment 1-10:**  None of the segments satisfied the Q6 criteria. None of them contain a minimiser combined with a scale contrast. Some segments mention numbers or quantities, but they aren't presented in a way that downplays significance through a clear comparison to a larger scale.\n\nTherefore, the answer for all segments is \"no.\" I'm pretty confident in that assessment.

I am currently focusing on Q7, specifically looking for \"bare negations\" – statements that convey a lack of something – without any accompanying calming cues.\n\nFor each segment, I checked if it contained a bare negation (e.g., \"does not cause,\" \"will not enter\"). If a bare negation *was* present *without* a calming cue, the answer for Q7 is \"yes,\" and the frame is \"Neutral.\" If a bare negation was present *with* a calming cue, the answer would be \"no\" (proceeding to other cues), as I'm looking to identify *explicit* reassuring cues, and these text segments are just stating a lack of an event. I must provide a JSON array containing the results, with each entry indicating whether the segment met the criteria for a bare negation without calming and providing a rationale for my decision.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n*   **Segment 1:** The segment begins with \"Avian flu usually does not cause any symptoms...\" The phrase \"does not cause any symptoms\" is a bare negation. There is no accompanying calming language. I determined the answer is \"yes,\" and assigned the rationale: \"'does not cause any symptoms' is a bare negation without explicit calming.\"\n*   **Segment 2:** This segment describes an event, not a bare negation, so Q7 did not apply, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes events and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 3:** Similar to Segment 2, this segment details events, not a bare negation. Q7: \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes events and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 4:** This segment describes an action, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes actions and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 5:** This states a status, not a bare negation. Q7: \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment states the status of test results and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 6:** This segment contains \"will not enter the food system,\" which is a bare negation. There is no accompanying calming cue. Therefore the answer is \"yes,\" rationale: \"'will not enter the food system' is a bare negation without explicit calming.\"\n*   **Segment 7:** This segment reports statistical data, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment reports statistical data and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 8:** This segment states a fact about other regions, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment states a fact about other regions and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 9:** This segment describes events, so the answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes events and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n*   **Segment 10:** This segment details a situation. Answer is \"no,\" rationale: \"The segment describes events and does not contain a bare negation.\"\n\nTherefore the segments that met the criteria for bare negations without calming cues were segments 1 and 6, where the frame is \"Neutral.\" The other segments did not contain the criteria to satisfy Q7.\n"}

This describes an action being taken (\"to be culled\"), which is a response measure, but it doesn't offer explicit reassurance.\n*   **Segment 6:** \"The outbreak came despite the government last week ordering all birds on poultry farms to be kept indoors after tests confirmed a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in two dead wild swans found in a village near the central city of Utrecht.\" - **Answer: Yes**. Describes a safeguard (\"ordering all birds... indoors\") *without* linking it to current calm or safety. The context notes it happening despite the safeguard, so it isn't an explicit reassurance.\n*   **Segment 7:** \"The agriculture ministry tightened controls Thursday around the infected farm in the village of Altforst, 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the capital, Amsterdam.\" - **Answer: Yes**. It describes an action taken by the authorities (tightened controls) which is a response, and does not provide an explicit link to reassurance.\n*   **Segment 8:** \"Another 34 farms are situated within a 10-kilometer (6 mile) radius of the infected location.\" - **Answer: No**. It's a factual statement about a geographical situation, not about capability or preparedness.\n*   **Segment 9:** \"Authorities banned the transport of any birds, eggs, manure, used straw and other animal products from the 10-kilometer ring around the infected farm.\" - **Answer: Yes**. It describes a safeguard (banning transport), without an explicit link to current calm or minimized risk.\n*   **Segment 10:** \"The new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9 of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana.\" - **Answer: No**.
