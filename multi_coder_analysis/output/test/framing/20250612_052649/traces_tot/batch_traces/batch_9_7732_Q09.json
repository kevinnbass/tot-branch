  "thoughts": "**Applying Q9: An Expert's Perspective**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with applying Q9 to these three text segments. My understanding of Q9, and this is crucial, is that it's designed to identify segments that *primarily* report economic metrics – prices, costs, revenues, and the like – using standard language, *without* the flair of vivid verbs or framing that might color the interpretation. I'm focusing on factual reporting.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n*   **Segment 1 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_1\\_1\\_chunk0):** This one describes bird flu's impact on turkeys. While it quantifies \"deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys,\" that's a direct count, not an economic indicator in the sense we're looking for with Q9. The focus is on the *cause* of the deaths, not any potential impact on prices or costs, at least not explicitly. Q9 is interested in those direct economic figures. So, no on this one.\n\n*   **Segment 2 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_4\\_1\\_chunk0):** Here, we get more details about the virus and location. Again, we see the phrase \"turkey deaths,\" but it's not a quantitative economic metric. We're given more context, but the emphasis is still on the *nature* of the virus and the *location* of the outbreak. The \"deadly\" descriptor is a technical term for the virus, not an economic risk adjective related to pricing or other economic metrics. So, no here, too.\n\n*   **Segment 3 (ID: seg\\_v5\\_14\\_1004\\_chunk0):** This is the key one. We see \"cost the federal government nearly $1 billion.\" Now we are talking about numbers. The *verb* \"cost\" is crucial. It's a standard, neutral verb to describe an economic impact. The dollar value is also directly quantifying an economic metric. The sentence provides a clear economic measure, and crucially, it avoids any emotionally charged verbs or descriptive framing. It’s reporting facts. This *does* align with Q9.\n\n**Final Analysis:** After double-checking my understanding of Q9, and its intent to identify neutral reporting of economic metrics, I am confident in this decision.\n\n**JSON Array Construction:**\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_1_1_chunk0\",\n    \"q9_compliant\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_4_1_chunk0\",\n    \"q9_compliant\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"segment_id\": \"seg_v5_14_1004_chunk0\",\n    \"q9_compliant\": true\n  }\n]\n```\n"
