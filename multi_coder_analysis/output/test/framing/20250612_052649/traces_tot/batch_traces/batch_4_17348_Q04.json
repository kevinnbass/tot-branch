AND is it distinguishable from a neutral, purely information-seeking question, as detailed in the rules?\n\n**🔍 Q4 Pattern Recognition Table:**\n| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |\n|------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Loaded Questions (Worry/Fear)** | \"Should consumers worry...?\" \"Are we facing a crisis?\" \"Is it safe to...?\" | ✓ |\n| **Loaded Questions (Inaction)** | \"Are we going to stand by while this unfolds?\" \"How long can we ignore this?\" | ✓ |\n| **Neutral Information-Seeking** | \"What are the safety protocols?\" \"When will results be available?\" | → Neutral |\n\n**🔗 See also:** Q1 for intensified language that may appear in questions; Q2 for potent metaphors in questions\n\n**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Alarmist.

Cues: 'system collapsing,' 'truly feel safe anymore?' - rhetorical question implying no).\n  * **Non-Example (Neutral):** Author: \"What are the safety protocols in place?\" (Information-seeking).\n* Use of loaded rhetorical questions by the quoted source or author that are designed to evoke fear, urgency, or strong concern by implying a severe problem or a dire lack of action.\n  * Example (Author-driven): 'How many more animals have to die before we finally act decisively?' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The rhetorical question uses emotive language 'have to die' and implies criticism of inaction, framing the situation as urgent and severe.)\n  * Example (Quote-driven): 'The activist asked, \"Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?\"' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The quoted rhetorical question uses 'disaster unfolds' to frame the situation alarmingly.)\n  * **Example (Rhetorical question from author implying worry):** Author: \"With new variants emerging rapidly, should humans be worried about the next pandemic?\" → Alarmist (if the context suggests this is not a simple information request but a way to frame emerging variants as a worrisome threat).\n\n**Few-Shot Exemplars:**\n| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Alarmist – Loaded Q** | \"Should consumers be worried about buying eggs?\" | **Alarmist** | Loaded rhetorical question implying worry |\n\n**Regex Pattern:** `\\b(?:should|can|could|will)\\s+\\w+\\s+(?:be\\s+)?(?:worried|concerned)\\b`\n\n### Your JSON Reply:\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes|no|uncertain\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>\"\n}\n``` ",

  "thoughts": "**Applying Q4: Rhetorical Question Assessment**\n\nOkay, I've got the task. The user wants me to run Q4 on ten different text segments. Q4 is all about identifying if a segment contains a rhetorical question that's designed to scare the audience or make them feel a sense of urgency. My job is to meticulously go through each segment, look for questions, and then decide if those questions are just neutral requests for information or if they're loaded with implied alarm.\n\nSo, let's dive in. I'm going to quickly scan each segment, focusing specifically on looking for questions. After my analysis I concluded:\n\n*   **seg_v5_11_1001_chunk0**: No questions detected.\n*   **seg_v5_12_1001_chunk0**: No questions here.\n*   **seg_v5_1_1_chunk0**: This one's clean – no questions.\n*   **seg_v5_2_1_chunk0**: Another segment without any questions.\n*   **seg_v5_3_1_chunk0**: No question here as well.\n*   **seg_v5_4_1_chunk0**: A statement \"It was not clear how the bird flu virus found its way to the farms.\" which can be misinterpreted, but is a statement and not a question.\n*   **seg_v5_11_1004_chunk0**: This segment is straightforward, no questions.\n*   **seg_v5_12_1004_chunk0**: No questions here, either.\n*   **seg_v5_13_1004_chunk0**: It's all clear, no rhetorical hooks.\n*   **seg_v5_14_1004_chunk0**: No questions.\n\nAfter thoroughly analyzing each segment for loaded, rhetorical questions, my conclusion is that none of the segments present any alarming or fear-inducing rhetorical questions. In other words, the answer for all ten segments is a resounding \"no.\"\n"
