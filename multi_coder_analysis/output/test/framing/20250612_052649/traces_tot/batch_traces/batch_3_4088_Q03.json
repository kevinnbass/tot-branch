(Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)\n* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: \"The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%.\" (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).\n* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: \"Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds.\" (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').\n\n**Key Principle:** \"swept across,\" \"hard hit,\" \"soared,\" \"plummeted\" can be potent verbs on their own (see Q2) if used dramatically. This rule specifically addresses their use when their alarmist nature is confirmed by accompanying details of scale/impact.\n\n**Boundary Requirements (clarified):**\n1.

  "thoughts": "**Q3 Analysis - A Step-by-Step Breakdown**\n\nOkay, I've got the task. The instructions are clear: check each segment for a moderate verb (from the predefined list) used with scale or impact information, according to the provided rules. The goal is to determine if Q3 applies to any of these ten segments. Here's how I'm thinking about it:\n\nFirst, I went through each segment meticulously. I started by identifying all the verbs in each sentence. Then, I cross-referenced those verbs against my list of \"moderate verbs.\" If a verb didn't appear on that list, it was immediately a \"no\" for that segment. Even if there *was* scale/impact information (like \"864 people\" or \"456 deaths\"), if the verb didn't match, it was a non-starter. The key here is the *pairing* of the verb with impact.\n\nWhen I found a match from the moderate verb list, I then scanned for any associated scale or impact data. I needed a clear and direct connection between the impact information and that moderate verb. If the verb indicated future action (\"planning to cull,\" \"threatens to spark\"), or was simply factual (\"confirmed,\" \"is\"), even if it had impact data, it wasn't a match. The impact information had to be *directly* tied to a moderate verb.\n\nFor instance, in Segment 2, there was an impact (\"864 people have contracted it... resulting in 456 deaths\"), but the verbs in that segment are factual. Segment 4 was about a plan, and Segment 9, while containing impactful information, had a future/potential verb (\"threatens\").\n\nIn Segment 10, the text gives an example of scale/impact. The segment states the avian virus \"killed 50 million birds across 15 states.\" However, even though the verb \"killed\" has impact data, \"killed\" is explicitly excluded.\n\nTherefore, after a thorough review of all ten segments, I can conclude that none of them meet the specific criteria for Q3. I'll format my response as a JSON array with all \"no\" answers.\n"
