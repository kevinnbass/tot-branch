# ALARMIST CUES
Patterns that indicate an alarmist framing of the information.

---
### Pattern: Q1: Base Risk-Adj (alone)
**Frame:** Alarmist
**Hop:** Q1
**QUICK CHECK:** • Contains INTENSIFIER (**SO / VERY / EXTREMELY / HIGHLY / FRIGHTENINGLY / MORE / DEADLIER**) **AND** RISK‑ADJ (**DEADLY / DANGEROUS / SEVERE / CATASTROPHIC / LETHAL / CONTAGIOUS / VIRULENT / DESTRUCTIVE**) in the **same clause**?  
• Skip if it's the taxonomic phrase **"highly pathogenic (avian) influenza / HPAI"**.  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- "deadly," "dangerous," "severe" (without intensifier)

**INCLUSION CRITERIA:**
- Authorial use of intensifiers (e.g., 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely,' 'incredibly,' 'particularly,' 'frighteningly') coupled with high-valence negative adjectives (e.g., 'destructive,' 'contagious') to describe the subject or its characteristics. The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)

**GUARDS & REQUIREMENTS:**
- *BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**
- (See **TECH_TERM_GUARD** in `global_header.txt`.)*

**CLARIFICATIONS:**
- ** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, "deadly" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.
- TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  
A term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. "lethal dose 50").  
**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**


---
### Pattern: Q2: Neutral Economic Trend
**Frame:** Alarmist
**Hop:** Q2
**QUICK CHECK:** • Contains any HIGH‑POTENCY VERB (**RAVAGED / DEVASTATED / SKYROCKETED / PLUMMETED / CRASHED / NOSEDIVED / TANKED / CRIPPLING / SPIRALLED / BALLOONED / ROCKETED**)  
  **OR** ALERT phrase (**ON HIGH ALERT**) **OR** METAPHOR (**TICKING TIME‑BOMB / NIGHTMARE SCENARIO**)?  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- "prices are trending sharply higher/lower"

**INCLUSION CRITERIA:**
- Authorial use of vivid, active verbs or metaphors to describe the spread or impact of a threat, especially when combined with its scale or severity, thereby emphasizing its uncontrolled, rapid, or overwhelming nature. Example: Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)
- Superlative
- "The economic impact of the subject on the agricultural sector is a ticking time-bomb for food security," said the analyst. (Alarmist → The analyst's quote uses a potent metaphor "ticking time-bomb," framing the economic impact with fear/urgency.)
- Author: "Political inaction is steering us towards a catastrophic crisis related to the subject." (Alarmist → Author's framing of political aspect through loaded language like "catastrophic crisis," assuming no overriding framed quote.)

**DETAILED EXAMPLES:**
- Author: "The virus is a raging inferno, tearing through populations with terrifying speed, leaving devastation in its wake."
- Reasoning: "Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses vivid metaphor 'raging inferno,' 'tearing through,' 'terrifying speed,' and 'devastation in its wake.' Decisive cues: 'raging inferno,' 'terrifying speed'."

**CLARIFICATIONS:**
- Context caveat for "soaring/soared/soar":**  
Treat "amid **soaring inflation**" or any usage where *soaring* modifies a **background, macro context** (inflation, interest-rates, temperatures, etc.) as **contextual — ignore for Alarmist coding**.  
Only count it when the vivid verb modifies a **direct impact noun** of the threat (cases, prices, losses, deaths, production, shortages …).
- Emotional reactions alone ≠ vivid language:** Simple emotional descriptors without vivid verbs/metaphors stay Neutral.
- ✗ "very sad" (bare emotion)
- ✓ "devastating heartbreak" (vivid + emotion)


---
### Pattern: Q2: Moderate Verbs (alone)
**Frame:** Alarmist
**Hop:** Q2
**QUICK CHECK:** • Contains any HIGH‑POTENCY VERB (**RAVAGED / DEVASTATED / SKYROCKETED / PLUMMETED / CRASHED / NOSEDIVED / TANKED / CRIPPLING / SPIRALLED / BALLOONED / ROCKETED**)  
  **OR** ALERT phrase (**ON HIGH ALERT**) **OR** METAPHOR (**TICKING TIME‑BOMB / NIGHTMARE SCENARIO**)?  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- "hit," "swept," "surged" (without scale/impact details)

**INCLUSION CRITERIA:**
- Authorial use of vivid, active verbs or metaphors to describe the spread or impact of a threat, especially when combined with its scale or severity, thereby emphasizing its uncontrolled, rapid, or overwhelming nature. Example: Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)
- Superlative
- "The economic impact of the subject on the agricultural sector is a ticking time-bomb for food security," said the analyst. (Alarmist → The analyst's quote uses a potent metaphor "ticking time-bomb," framing the economic impact with fear/urgency.)
- Author: "Political inaction is steering us towards a catastrophic crisis related to the subject." (Alarmist → Author's framing of political aspect through loaded language like "catastrophic crisis," assuming no overriding framed quote.)

**DETAILED EXAMPLES:**
- Author: "The virus is a raging inferno, tearing through populations with terrifying speed, leaving devastation in its wake."
- Reasoning: "Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses vivid metaphor 'raging inferno,' 'tearing through,' 'terrifying speed,' and 'devastation in its wake.' Decisive cues: 'raging inferno,' 'terrifying speed'."

**CLARIFICATIONS:**

- Emotional reactions alone ≠ vivid language:** Simple emotional descriptors without vivid verbs/metaphors stay Neutral.
- ✗ "very sad" (bare emotion)
- ✓ "devastating heartbreak" (vivid + emotion)

### Pattern: Q2: Psychological Verbs
**Frame:** Alarmist
**Hop:** Q2
**QUICK CHECK:** • Contains any HIGH‑POTENCY VERB (**RAVAGED / DEVASTATED / SKYROCKETED / PLUMMETED / CRASHED / NOSEDIVED / TANKED / CRIPPLING / SPIRALLED / BALLOONED / ROCKETED**)  
  **OR** ALERT phrase (**ON HIGH ALERT**) **OR** METAPHOR (**TICKING TIME‑BOMB / NIGHTMARE SCENARIO**)?  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- "spark fears," "stoke concern," "reignite worries" *without* vivid intensifier or scale

**INCLUSION CRITERIA:**
- Authorial use of vivid, active verbs or metaphors to describe the spread or impact of a threat, especially when combined with its scale or severity, thereby emphasizing its uncontrolled, rapid, or overwhelming nature. Example: Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)
- Superlative

### Pattern: Q3: Moderate verbs + scale/impact
**Frame:** Alarmist
**Hop:** Q3
**QUICK CHECK:** • Contains MODERATE VERB (**HIT / SWEPT / SOARED / SURGED / PLUMMETED / PROMPTED / SPIKED / PEAKED / JUMPED / SHOT UP / HARD HIT**) **AND** explicit SCALE token (digit / MILLION / THOUSAND / % / RECORD / UNPRECEDENTED) in same sentence?  
• Ignore if action is only *planned* (e.g. "to consider culling").  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

**INCLUSION CRITERIA:**
- Author: "The region was severely hit by the virus, resulting in record losses." (Alarmist → Author's use of "severely hit" and "record losses" to describe large-scale harm, assuming no overriding framed quote.)
- Author: 'From Wyoming to Maine, the highly contagious bird flu swept across farms and backyard flocks, prompting millions of chickens and turkeys to be culled.' (Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)

**DETAILED EXAMPLES:**
- Numerical quantities: "millions," "thousands," "50%," "record numbers"
- Comparative terms: "largest," "highest," "most severe," "unprecedented"
- Impact descriptors: "overwhelming," "devastating losses," "widespread damage"

>

**CLARIFICATIONS:**
- **
The containment-override is **suspended** if the scale is described with extreme language (e.g., "brutally destroyed 3 million", "devastating culling of millions"). In such cases, Q3 can still fire for the extreme framing of the scale itself.
- NEW NOTE – 2025-06-18
Containment verbs (culled, euthanised, destroyed, depopulated) **always neutralise** a preceding ModerateVerb + Scale pattern. Do NOT fire Q3 unless an additional vivid/emotive cue is present.
- Containment-Override Exception:**
The containment-override is **suspended** if the scale is described with extreme language (e.g., "brutally destroyed 3 million", "devastating culling of millions"). In such cases, Q3 can still fire for the extreme framing of the scale itself.


---
### Pattern: Q4: Neutral Information-Seeking
**Frame:** Alarmist
**Hop:** Q4
**QUICK CHECK:** • Sentence is a QUESTION starting with **SHOULD / CAN / COULD / WILL / WHAT IF / HOW LONG** **AND** includes **WORRIED / CONCERNED / AFRAID / IGNORE / STAND BY**?  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.
• Regex now pre-catches **"Is it safe to …?"** and **"How many more … have to die?"** rhetorical questions; you can ignore those.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- "What are the safety protocols?" "When will results be available?"

**INCLUSION CRITERIA:**
- Direct questions from the author that use explicitly loaded or emotionally charged language clearly designed to imply an Alarmist frame or instill fear/urgency in the reader.


---

# REASSURING CUES
Patterns that indicate a reassuring framing of the information.

---
### Pattern: Q5: Explicit calming cue for reassurance
**Frame:** Reassuring
**Hop:** Q5
**QUICK CHECK:** Does the segment contain ANY of these explicit reassurance markers?
• **Safety/Control**: SAFE / NO CAUSE FOR ALARM / UNDER CONTROL / REST EASY
• **Confidence**: CONFIDENT / ENCOURAGED / OPTIMISTIC / EXCELLENT NEWS
• **Supply**: NO SHORTAGE / AMPLE SUPPLY / PLENTY / SHELVES FULL
• **Risk**: RISK IS *VERY* LOW / DON'T PANIC / NO NEED TO PANIC

**If YES and from official/author** → Check detailed patterns below
**If NO** → Skip to `"no"`

**CLARIFICATIONS:**
- ** (1) Official source AND (2) Safety link ≤40 chars |
- **


---
### Pattern: Q6: Minimiser without Scale
**Frame:** Reassuring
**Hop:** Q6
**QUICK CHECK:** • Contains MINIMISER (**ONLY / JUST / MERELY / A SINGLE / VERY FEW / RELATIVELY FEW**) **AND** denominator marker (**OUT OF / AMONG / ONE OF / AMONG MILLIONS / NATIONWIDE**) in same sentence or immediately adjacent (≤20 chars)?  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- "only three samples showed irregularity" (no "out of X")

**GUARDS & REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✓ "Only 3 farms out of 1000" (minimizes outbreak scope)
- ✗ "The lone symptom was conjunctivitis" (describes single patient)

> **Clarification** A **bare numeral (e.g., "1", "one") is *not* a minimiser**  
> unless it is **preceded by** one of the lexical cues above.  
> - Example (Neutral): "One barn among thousands was infected."  
> - Example (Reassuring): "Only one barn among thousands was infected."

The combination should create an overall reassuring effect about the limited scope or impact of an issue.
- *Examples:**
- **Reassuring:** "While there were concerns, only 3 out of 5,000 tested samples showed any irregularity, indicating the problem is not widespread." → Reassuring.
- **Non-Example (Missing Contrast):** "Only 3 samples showed irregularity." → Could be Neutral if the "out of X" contrast is missing and no other reassuring cues are present.
- *Guard clause** – If no *minimiser token* **or** no explicit denominator is found, fall through to **Q7 bare‑negation**.

**CLARIFICATIONS:**
- "One barn among thousands was infected."  
> - Example (Reassuring): "Only one barn among thousands was infected."
- Scope Requirement:** The minimizer must apply to outbreak/population risk, NOT individual case descriptions.
- ✓ "Only 3 farms out of 1000" (minimizes outbreak scope)
- ✗ "The lone symptom was conjunctivitis" (describes single patient)


---
### Pattern: Q6: Scale without Minimiser
**Frame:** Reassuring
**Hop:** Q6
**QUICK CHECK:** • Contains MINIMISER (**ONLY / JUST / MERELY / A SINGLE / VERY FEW / RELATIVELY FEW**) **AND** denominator marker (**OUT OF / AMONG / ONE OF / AMONG MILLIONS / NATIONWIDE**) in same sentence or immediately adjacent (≤20 chars)?  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- "one barn among thousands" (no "only/just/merely/**a single/few**")

**GUARDS & REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✓ "Only 3 farms out of 1000" (minimizes outbreak scope)
- ✗ "The lone symptom was conjunctivitis" (describes single patient)

> **Clarification** A **bare numeral (e.g., "1", "one") is *not* a minimiser**  
> unless it is **preceded by** one of the lexical cues above.  
> - Example (Neutral): "One barn among thousands was infected."  
> - Example (Reassuring): "Only one barn among thousands was infected."

The combination should create an overall reassuring effect about the limited scope or impact of an issue.
- *Examples:**
- **Reassuring:** "While there were concerns, only 3 out of 5,000 tested samples showed any irregularity, indicating the problem is not widespread." → Reassuring.
- **Non-Example (Missing Contrast):** "Only 3 samples showed irregularity." → Could be Neutral if the "out of X" contrast is missing and no other reassuring cues are present.
- *Guard clause** – If no *minimiser token* **or** no explicit denominator is found, fall through to **Q7 bare‑negation**.

**CLARIFICATIONS:**
- "One barn among thousands was infected."  
> - Example (Reassuring): "Only one barn among thousands was infected."
- Scope Requirement:** The minimizer must apply to outbreak/population risk, NOT individual case descriptions.
- ✓ "Only 3 farms out of 1000" (minimizes outbreak scope)
- ✗ "The lone symptom was conjunctivitis" (describes single patient)


---
### Pattern: Q11: Dominant Reassuring Quote
**Frame:** Variable
**Hop:** Q11
**QUICK CHECK:** • Direct QUOTE contains explicit Alarmist cue (**EXTREMELY CONCERNING / IMMEDIATE ACTION / HIGH RISK / CATASTROPHIC**) **OR** explicit Reassuring cue (**NO CAUSE FOR ALARM / EXCELLENT NEWS / SAFE TO EAT / VERY WELL PROTECTED**).  
• If both or balanced → `"no"` (mixed → Neutral).  
→ If one side dominant → `"yes"` and append `||FRAME=Alarmist` or `||FRAME=Reassuring`.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- "no cause for alarm," "excellent news," "very well protected"

**CLARIFICATIONS:**
- Primacy of Framed Quotations"?
- Primacy of Framed Quotations (SUPERSEDES PREVIOUS QUOTE RULES)**
**Technical-term override**  
Before deciding that a quoted risk-adjective is Alarmist under Q11,  
**skip** the cue if the adjective is immediately preceded (≤ 3 tokens) by the
whitelisted biomedical collocations:  
*"highly pathogenic"*, *"highly pathogenic avian"*, *"HPAI"*.  
Rationale: Q1 technical-term guard has higher precedence and treats these
as neutral taxonomy, not intensification.
- Descriptive vs Amplifying:** Expert descriptions of biological/scientific facts are NEUTRAL unless they use explicit framing language.
- ✗ "The virus doesn't just locate in the lungs" (neutral description)
- ✓ "This is extremely concerning - the virus spreads beyond lungs" (explicit alarm)


---

# NEUTRAL INDICATORS
Patterns that indicate neutral, factual reporting.

---
### Pattern: Q7: Bare Negation + Calming Cue
**Frame:** Neutral
**Hop:** Q7
**QUICK CHECK:** • Sentence shows BARE NEGATION (**NO / NOT / UNLIKELY / POSES NO RISK / NO EVIDENCE / DOES NOT**) **AND** lacks any calming keyword **or optimism adjective** (**welcome / encouraging / heartening / positive / optimistic / upbeat**)?  
→ If yes → `"yes"` (Neutral); else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- "no cases detected, so consumers can be confident," "unlikely to affect supply, keeping risk very low"

**CLARIFICATIONS:**
- **  
`poses no risk`, `unlikely to cause`, `no evidence of`, `not expected to`,
`does not affect`, `cannot spread to`, **"does not pose a threat"**
- ️ Additional problematic phrasings that remain NEUTRAL:**
- "unlikely to affect consumers"
- "no evidence of transmission"  
- "doesn't pose a risk to humans"
- "not expected to cause problems"
- "will not impact food supply"


---
### Pattern: Q8: Capability + Active Reassurance
**Frame:** Neutral
**Hop:** Q8
**QUICK CHECK:** • Describes CAPABILITY / PREPAREDNESS (**PREPARED / PLAN / SYSTEM / PROTOCOL / RESOURCES / STOCKPILED / DEVELOPED**) **AND** no calming keyword (**SAFE / REST EASY / UNDER CONTROL / ALARM**) within 40 tokens?  
• If the sentence already fires Q5 "Transient‑Issue Minimiser"  
  (e.g. contains "short‑term blip", "resolve quickly"), **skip Q8**.
→ If yes → `"yes"` (Neutral); else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- "stockpiled 30M doses, which is excellent news and means citizens are very well protected," "systems in place, so public can rest easy"


---
### Pattern: Q9: Vivid Economic Verbs
**Frame:** Neutral
**Hop:** Q9
**QUICK CHECK:** • Reports ECON metric with standard verb (**ROSE / FELL / INCREASED / DECLINED / WERE UP / WERE DOWN / %**) **AND** lacks vivid verbs (**SKYROCKETED / PLUMMETED / CRASHED**) or risk adjectives?  
→ If yes → `"yes"` (Neutral); else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- "prices skyrocketed," "costs plummeted," "markets crashed"

**CLARIFICATIONS:**
- Trade/Price Reporting Rule:** Statements about financial metrics (exports, imports, sales, production) are treated as factual reporting → Neutral, even if they contain numbers or comparisons, unless explicit framing language is added.


---
### Pattern: Q9: Risk Adjectives + Economics
**Frame:** Neutral
**Hop:** Q9
**QUICK CHECK:** • Reports ECON metric with standard verb (**ROSE / FELL / INCREASED / DECLINED / WERE UP / WERE DOWN / %**) **AND** lacks vivid verbs (**SKYROCKETED / PLUMMETED / CRASHED**) or risk adjectives?  
→ If yes → `"yes"` (Neutral); else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- "catastrophic losses," "devastating decline," "crippling costs"

**CLARIFICATIONS:**
- Trade/Price Reporting Rule:** Statements about financial metrics (exports, imports, sales, production) are treated as factual reporting → Neutral, even if they contain numbers or comparisons, unless explicit framing language is added.


---
### Pattern: Q10: Future Relief + Current Reassurance
**Frame:** Neutral
**Hop:** Q10
**QUICK CHECK:** • Contains FUTURE‑RELIEF modal (**MAY / MIGHT / COULD / EXPECT / PREDICT / HOPE**) **AND** relief verb (**EASE / IMPROVE / NORMALIZE / END / RELIEF / RECOVERY**) without current calming keyword?  
→ If yes → `"yes"` (Neutral); else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- "Because measures are working, restrictions may end soon, bringing relief," "situation improving, so outlook is positive"


---
### Pattern: Q12: Remaining Framing Cues
**Frame:** Neutral
**Hop:** Q12
**QUICK CHECK:** • After checking Q1‑Q11, are **zero** Alarmist or Reassuring cues left?  
→ If yes → `"yes"` (Neutral); else → `"no"` and re‑evaluate higher‑priority hops.

**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
- Any missed intensifiers, potent verbs, explicit calming language

**CLARIFICATIONS:**
- ** This rule applies if both the author's presentation and the presentation by any quoted sources are neutral.


---

# PRECEDENCE RULES

When multiple patterns match, apply these rules:
1. If both Alarmist and Reassuring cues present → Neutral (mixed signals)
2. Higher-numbered questions (Q1-Q4) take precedence over lower ones
3. Explicit quotes (Q11) can override authorial framing
4. Technical terms (e.g., "highly pathogenic avian influenza") never count as intensifiers

---

# UNIVERSAL GUARDS

These apply to ALL patterns:
1. **Source Requirement**: For reassuring cues, speaker must be official/authority or author
2. **Context Requirement**: Cues must relate to the main threat, not background conditions
3. **Technical Term Guard**: "highly pathogenic (avian) influenza" and "HPAI" are neutral taxonomy
4. **Containment Override**: Containment verbs (culled, destroyed) can neutralize some patterns
