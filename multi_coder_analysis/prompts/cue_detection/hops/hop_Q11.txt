### Question Q11 – Dominant Quote Check
If the segment contains a *dominant* Alarmist or Reassuring quotation (as reflected in your CUE_MAP), answer "yes" and append `||FRAME=Alarmist` or `||FRAME=Reassuring` accordingly.

If quotations are balanced or absent, answer "no" (or "uncertain").

{
  "answer": "yes|no|uncertain",
  "rationale": "<max 80 tokens – quote and token if yes>"
}
```
