### Question Q8 – Capability / Preparedness (Neutral)
If CUE_MAP indicates a *Capability / Preparedness* cue (e.g., "systems in place", "vaccine can be developed") **without** an explicit calming keyword, answer "yes".

If the capability statement includes calming language (then it belonged to Q5) or if no capability cue, answer "no" (or "uncertain").

Return JSON:
```json
{
  "answer": "yes|no|uncertain",
  "rationale": "<max 80 tokens – quote cue if yes>"
}
```
