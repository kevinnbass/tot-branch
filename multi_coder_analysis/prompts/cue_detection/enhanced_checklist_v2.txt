# ENHANCED CUE DETECTION CHECKLIST V2
This checklist contains 100% of the content from the original hop prompts.
Every rule, example, guard, exclusion, and special case is preserved.

## HOW TO USE THIS CHECKLIST

1. Read the segment carefully
2. Work through each hop section systematically
3. For each pattern:
   - Check the QUICK DECISION CHECK first
   - Review the pattern table
   - Apply ALL inclusion criteria
   - Check ALL exclusions and guards
   - Consider precedence rules
4. Mark patterns as PRESENT or ABSENT in your CUE_MAP
5. Use the CUE_MAP to answer hop questions

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

- Technical terms like "highly pathogenic avian influenza" are ALWAYS neutral
- Containment verbs (culled, destroyed) can override certain patterns
- Distance requirements (e.g., "within 40 chars") must be strictly followed
- When multiple patterns match, apply precedence rules

---

# ALARMIST PATTERNS (Q1-Q4)
These patterns indicate alarmist framing of information.

---
### Hop Q1: Intensifier / comparative + risk-adjective
**Frame:** Alarmist

**⚡ QUICK DECISION CHECK:**
• Contains INTENSIFIER (**SO / VERY / EXTREMELY / HIGHLY / FRIGHTENINGLY / MORE / DEADLIER**) **AND** RISK‑ADJ (**DEADLY / DANGEROUS / SEVERE / CATASTROPHIC / LETHAL / CONTAGIOUS / VIRULENT / DESTRUCTIVE**) in the **same clause**?  
• Skip if it's the taxonomic phrase **"highly pathogenic (avian) influenza / HPAI"**.  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN RECOGNITION TABLE:**
| Pattern ID | Pattern Type | Examples | Outcome |
|------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| Q1.1 | Intensifier + Risk-Adj | "so deadly," "very dangerous," "extremely severe," "highly lethal," "frighteningly contagious" | ✓ |
| Q1.2 | Comparative + Risk-Adj | "more deadly," "deadlier," "more dangerous," "less safe," "increasingly severe" | ✓ |
| Q1.3 | Fixed Lethal-from-Outset Idiom | "deadly from the start," "deadly from the outset" | ✓ |
| | Base Risk-Adj (alone) | "deadly," "dangerous," "severe" (without intensifier) | → Neutral |


**INCLUSION CRITERIA:**
- Authorial use of intensifiers (e.g., 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely,' 'incredibly,' 'particularly,' 'frighteningly') coupled with high-valence negative adjectives (e.g., 'destructive,' 'contagious') to describe the subject or its characteristics. The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)

**EXCLUSIONS:**
- When "volatile" modifies *prices/markets/rates* it is treated as an **economic metric** and never triggers Q1.
- > **Technical-term guard** – "highly pathogenic" used as part of the formal
- > disease name (HPAI) is **Neutral** unless further alarmist cues appear.
- ### Your JSON Reply:
- ```json
- {
- "answer": "yes|no|uncertain",
- "rationale": "<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>"
- }
- ```

**GUARDS & REQUIREMENTS:**
- Technical Term Guard: 'highly pathogenic (avian) influenza' and 'HPAI' are neutral taxonomy
- Containment Override: 'culled' can neutralize certain patterns

**EXAMPLES & CASES:**
- | **→ Alarmist** |
- |------------------|--------------|----------------|
- | **Intensifier + Risk-Adj** | "so deadly," "very dangerous," "extremely severe," "highly lethal," "frighteningly contagious" | ✓ |
- | **Comparative + Risk-Adj** | "more deadly," "deadlier," "more dangerous," "less safe," "increasingly severe" | ✓ |
- | **Fixed Lethal-from-Outset Idiom** | "deadly from the start," "deadly from the outset" | ✓ |
- | **Base Risk-Adj (alone)** | "deadly," "dangerous," "severe" (without intensifier) | → Neutral |
- | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |
- |--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
- | **Alarmist – Intensifier + adjective** | "The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled." | **Alarmist** | "so deadly" (intensifier + risk adjective) |
- | **Alarmist – Deadly-from-outset idiom** | "H5N1 is deadly from the start, vets warn." | **Alarmist** | "deadly from the start" (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom) |
- | **NON-EXAMPLE** | "Experts are *more worried* now." | **Neutral** | comparative + psychological adjective |
- Example: "`.

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.
## Question: Does the segment contain an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective?
## JSON Output:
{"
- Example: "The intensifier 'so' modifies the risk-adjective 'deadly'."
- Example: "'highly pathogenic' is a technical term, not an authorial intensifier on a general risk-adjective."
- Example: "The virus is contagious."
- Example: "The virus is frighteningly contagious, spreading like wildfire."
- Example: "Scientists warn the virus is becoming deadlier each season."
- Example: "Scientists track how the virus becomes more common each season."
- Example: "<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>"

**CLARIFICATIONS & NOTES:**
- ** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, "deadly" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.
- TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  
A term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. "lethal dose 50").  
**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**

**PRECEDENCE RULES:**
- **
* Authorial use of intensifiers (e.g., 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely,' 'incredibly,' 'particularly,' 'frighteningly') coupled with high-valence negative adjectives (e.g., 'destructive,' 'contagious') to describe the subject or its characteristics. The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)

### Hop Q2: High-potency verb / potent metaphor / on high alert
**Frame:** Alarmist

**⚡ QUICK DECISION CHECK:**
• Contains any HIGH‑POTENCY VERB (**RAVAGED / DEVASTATED / SKYROCKETED / PLUMMETED / CRASHED / NOSEDIVED / TANKED / CRIPPLING / SPIRALLED / BALLOONED / ROCKETED**)  
  **OR** ALERT phrase (**ON HIGH ALERT**) **OR** METAPHOR (**TICKING TIME‑BOMB / NIGHTMARE SCENARIO**)?  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN RECOGNITION TABLE:**
| Pattern ID | Pattern Type | Examples | Outcome |
|------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| Q2.1 | High-Potency Verbs | "ravaged," "devastated," "skyrocketed," "plummeted," "crashed," "nosedived," "tanked," "crippling," "unleashed," "slaughtered," **"writhing," "convulsing," "gasping," "twitching," "screaming," "trembling," "seizing"** | ✓ |
| | Neutral Economic Trend | "prices are trending sharply higher/lower" | → **Neutral** |
| Q2.2 | Superlative + Negative Noun | "most expensive disaster," "worst crisis," "record outbreak," "record-breaking catastrophe" | ✓ |
| Q2.3 | Critical Alert Phrase | "on high alert" (threat can appear **before or after** in ≤ 40 chars) | ✓ |
| Q2.4 | Potent Metaphors | "ticking time-bomb," "nightmare scenario," **"death sentence," "killer blow,"** "raging inferno," "powder keg," "house of cards" | ✓ |
| Q2.5 | Intensifier + Harm Noun | *Intensifier + Harm Noun* (handled by regex ≥ 2025-06-23) | ✓ |
| | Moderate Verbs (alone) | "hit," "swept," "surged" (without scale/impact details) | → Neutral |
| | Psychological Verbs | "spark fears," "stoke concern," "reignite worries" *without* vivid intensifier or scale | → Neutral |


**INCLUSION CRITERIA:**
- Authorial use of vivid, active verbs or metaphors to describe the spread or impact of a threat, especially when combined with its scale or severity, thereby emphasizing its uncontrolled, rapid, or overwhelming nature. Example: Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)
- Superlative **or intensifier** preceding a **harm noun** (mortality, losses, disaster, outbreak, crisis, toll, etc.) communicates scale the same way a superlative does; treat it as Alarmist under Q2 unless a higher‑precedence cue fires.

**EXAMPLES & CASES:**
- | **→ Alarmist** |
- |------------------|--------------|----------------|
- | **High-Potency Verbs** | "ravaged," "devastated," "skyrocketed," "plummeted," "crashed," "nosedived," "tanked," "crippling," "unleashed," "slaughtered," **"writhing," "convulsing," "gasping," "twitching," "screaming," "trembling," "seizing"** | ✓ |

- | *Intensifier + Harm Noun* (handled by regex ≥ 2025-06-23) | — | — |
- | **Critical Alert Phrase**(**same sentence must name a threat: outbreak, virus, flu, risk, danger …**) | "on high alert" (threat can appear **before or after** in ≤ 40 chars) | ✓ |
- | **Potent Metaphors** | "ticking time-bomb," "nightmare scenario," **"death sentence," "killer blow,"** "raging inferno," "powder keg," "house of cards" | ✓ |
- | **Moderate Verbs (alone)** | "hit," "swept," "surged" (without scale/impact details) | → Neutral |
- | **Psychological Verbs** | "spark fears," "stoke concern," "reignite worries" *without* vivid intensifier or scale | → Neutral |
- Author: "The virus is a raging inferno, tearing through populations with terrifying speed, leaving devastation in its wake."
- Reasoning: "Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses vivid metaphor 'raging inferno,' 'tearing through,' 'terrifying speed,' and 'devastation in its wake.' Decisive cues: 'raging inferno,' 'terrifying speed'."
- **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: "The disease ravaged poultry flocks across three states, leading to immense economic losses." (Alarmist → 'Ravaged' + 'across three states' + 'immense economic losses' create a strong alarmist frame).
- **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: "Confirmed cases soared past one million, overwhelming healthcare systems." (Alarmist → 'Soared past one million' + 'overwhelming healthcare systems' creates a strong alarmist frame).
- | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |
- |--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
- | **Alarmist – High-potency verb** | "An outbreak ravaged farms across three states." | **Alarmist** | "ravaged" (vivid, destructive verb) |
- | **Alarmist – Vivid symptom verb** | "Ducks **writhed on the ground**, convulsing before death." | **Alarmist** | "writhed", "convulsing" |
- | **Alarmist – Superlative-negative-noun** | "The H5N1 wave is now considered the most expensive animal-health disaster in U.S. history." | **Alarmist** | "most expensive...disaster" (superlative + negative noun) |
- | **Alarmist – Critical alert phrase** | "State authorities remain on high alert for new cases." | **Alarmist** | "on high alert" (critical alert phrase) |
- | **Neutral – price trend** | "Egg prices have been *trending sharply higher* in recent weeks." | **Neutral** | ordinary price verb |
- Example: "`.

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: An outbreak ravaged farms across three states.
## Question: Does the author/source employ a high-potency verb or potent metaphor?
## JSON Output:
{"
- Example: "rationale"
- Example: "The high-potency verb 'ravaged' actively frames the situation alarmingly."
- Example: "answer"
- Example: "'affected' is a moderate verb without dramatic framing - lacks high potency alone."
- Example: "The economic impact of the subject on the agricultural sector is a ticking time-bomb for food security,"
- Example: "Political inaction is steering us towards a catastrophic crisis related to the subject."
- Example: "catastrophic crisis,"
- Example: "Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses vivid metaphor 'raging inferno,' 'tearing through,' 'terrifying speed,' and 'devastation in its wake.' Decisive cues: 'raging inferno,' 'terrifying speed'."
- Example: "hit / hitting / swept / surged"
- Example: "yes|no|uncertain"
- Example: "<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>"

**CLARIFICATIONS & NOTES:**
- Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)
* Superlative **or intensifier** preceding a **harm noun**
  (mortality, losses, disaster, outbreak, crisis, toll, etc.)
  communicates scale the same way a superlative does; treat it as
  Alarmist under Q2 unless a higher‑precedence cue fires.
- Context caveat for "soaring/soared/soar":**  
Treat "amid **soaring inflation**" or any usage where *soaring* modifies a **background, macro context** (inflation, interest-rates, temperatures, etc.) as **contextual — ignore for Alarmist coding**.  
Only count it when the vivid verb modifies a **direct impact noun** of the threat (cases, prices, losses, deaths, production, shortages …).
- Emotional reactions alone ≠ vivid language:** Simple emotional descriptors without vivid verbs/metaphors stay Neutral.
- ✗ "very sad" (bare emotion)
- ✓ "devastating heartbreak" (vivid + emotion)

**SPECIAL RULES:**
- Distance requirement: within 40 characters

### Hop Q3: Moderate verbs + scale/impact
**Frame:** Alarmist

**⚡ QUICK DECISION CHECK:**
• Contains MODERATE VERB (**HIT / SWEPT / SOARED / SURGED / PLUMMETED / PROMPTED / SPIKED / PEAKED / JUMPED / SHOT UP / HARD HIT**) **AND** explicit SCALE token (digit / MILLION / THOUSAND / % / RECORD / UNPRECEDENTED) in same sentence?  
• Ignore if action is only *planned* (e.g. "to consider culling").  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.

**PATTERN RECOGNITION TABLE:**
| Pattern ID | Pattern Type | Examples | Outcome |
|------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| Q3.1 | Moderate Verb (past-tense) + Scale | "swept across + millions culled," "hard hit + record losses," "soared + overwhelming systems," **"spiked + record‑high prices," "peaked + doubled costs," "jumped + 27 percent,"** | ✓ |
| Q3.2 | Moderate Verb (past-tense) + Quantity | "surged + 50 % increase," "plummeted + largest decline," "hit + thousands affected" | ✓ |
| | Moderate Verb (present/future/plan) | *(e.g. "**planning to cull**", "could hit")* | → **Neutral** |


**GUARDS & REQUIREMENTS:**
- Containment Override: 'culled' can neutralize certain patterns

**EXAMPLES & CASES:**
- | **→ Alarmist** |
- |------------------|--------------|----------------|
- | **Moderate Verb (past-tense)** **+ Scale** | "swept across + millions culled," "hard hit + record losses," "soared + overwhelming systems," **"spiked + record‑high prices," "peaked + doubled costs," "jumped + 27 percent,"** | ✓ |
- | **Moderate Verb (past-tense)** **+ Quantity** | "surged + 50 % increase," "plummeted + largest decline," "hit + thousands affected" | ✓ |
- | **Moderate Verb (present/future/plan)** *(e.g. "**planning to cull**", "could hit")* | → **Neutral** |
- Author: "The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%." (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).
- **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: "Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds." (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').
- Numerical quantities: "millions," "thousands," "50%," "record numbers"
- Comparative terms: "largest," "highest," "most severe," "unprecedented"
- Impact descriptors: "overwhelming," "devastating losses," "widespread damage" > **New aspect guard.** The moderate-verb must denote **realised impact** – NOT merely an intention or hypothetical.
- Example: "`.

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: The region was severely hit by the virus, resulting in record losses.
## Question: Does the author/source use moderate verbs paired with significant scale/impact information?
## JSON Output:
{"
- Example: "rationale"
- Example: "'severely hit' with 'record losses' combines moderate verb with explicit large-scale impact."
- Example: "answer"
- Example: "'hit several farms' lacks specific scale/impact details to confirm alarmist framing."
- Example: "'hitting the market' + 'supplies are down' gives no number or record-type scale; stays Neutral."
- Example: "plummeted — a 50 % drop in one week"
- Example: "supplies are down / have dropped"
- Example: "were/was culled, destroyed, euthanized, depopulated"
- Example: "brutally destroyed 3 million birds"
- Example: "yes|no|uncertain"
- Example: "<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'>"

**CLARIFICATIONS & NOTES:**
- **
- Numerical quantities: "millions," "thousands," "50%," "record numbers"
- Comparative terms: "largest," "highest," "most severe," "unprecedented"
- Impact descriptors: "overwhelming," "devastating losses," "widespread damage"
- **
The containment-override is **suspended** if the scale is described with extreme language (e.g., "brutally destroyed 3 million", "devastating culling of millions"). In such cases, Q3 can still fire for the extreme framing of the scale itself.
- NEW NOTE – 2025-06-18
Containment verbs (culled, euthanised, destroyed, depopulated) **always neutralise** a preceding ModerateVerb + Scale pattern. Do NOT fire Q3 unless an additional vivid/emotive cue is present.
- Containment-Override Exception:**
The containment-override is **suspended** if the scale is described with extreme language (e.g., "brutally destroyed 3 million", "devastating culling of millions"). In such cases, Q3 can still fire for the extreme framing of the scale itself.

### Hop Q4: Loaded rhetorical question for alarm
**Frame:** Alarmist

**⚡ QUICK DECISION CHECK:**
• Sentence is a QUESTION starting with **SHOULD / CAN / COULD / WILL / WHAT IF / HOW LONG** **AND** includes **WORRIED / CONCERNED / AFRAID / IGNORE / STAND BY**?  
→ If yes → `"yes"`; else → `"no"`.
• Regex now pre-catches **"Is it safe to …?"** and **"How many more … have to die?"** rhetorical questions; you can ignore those.

**PATTERN RECOGNITION TABLE:**
| Pattern ID | Pattern Type | Examples | Outcome |
|------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| Q4.1 | Loaded Questions (Worry/Fear) | "Should consumers worry...?" "Are we facing a crisis?" "Is it safe to...?" | ✓ |
| Q4.2 | Loaded Questions (Inaction) | "Are we going to stand by while this unfolds?" "How long can we ignore this?" | ✓ |
| | Neutral Information-Seeking | "What are the safety protocols?" "When will results be available?" | → Neutral |


**INCLUSION CRITERIA:**
- Direct questions from the author that use explicitly loaded or emotionally charged language clearly designed to imply an Alarmist frame or instill fear/urgency in the reader.
- **Example:** **Author:** "With the system collapsing, can anyone truly feel safe anymore?" (Alarmist. Cues: 'system collapsing,' 'truly feel safe anymore?' - rhetorical question implying no).
- **Non-Example (Neutral):** Author: "What are the safety protocols in place?" (Information-seeking).
- Use of loaded rhetorical questions by the quoted source or author that are designed to evoke fear, urgency, or strong concern by implying a severe problem or a dire lack of action.
- Example (Author-driven): 'How many more animals have to die before we finally act decisively?' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The rhetorical question uses emotive language 'have to die' and implies criticism of inaction, framing the situation as urgent and severe.)
- Example (Quote-driven): 'The activist asked, "Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?"' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The quoted rhetorical question uses 'disaster unfolds' to frame the situation alarmingly.)
- **Example (Rhetorical question from author implying worry):** Author: "With new variants emerging rapidly, should humans be worried about the next pandemic?" → Alarmist (if the context suggests this is not a simple information request but a way to frame emerging variants as a worrisome threat).

- Example: "This development is 'concerning', but the virus 'does not transmit easily in humans,' the expert said."
- Example: "Initial alarm word 'concerning' is balanced by neutral factual clause without explicit reassurance; no dominant frame. ||FRAME=Neutral"
- Example: "Guidance Note: Primacy of Framed Quotations"
- Example: "highly pathogenic"
- Example: "highly pathogenic avian"
- Example: "*.  
Rationale: Q1 technical-term guard has higher precedence and treats these
as neutral taxonomy, not intensification.

**Preparedness safety-link check**  
When a quote says *"
- Example: "* **but** lacks an explicit public/consumer safety link within 40 chars (e.g., "
- Example: "), treat it as **Neutral** rather than Reassuring.

Core Principle: If – **and only if** – a statement is
  (a) delimited by quotation marks **OR** introduced with a
      colon‑style attribution inside ≤ 5 tokens  
      (e.g. *Officials said: "
- Example: "*) **AND**
  (b) spoken by a **named or institutional speaker**,  
then treat it as a direct quotation for Q11 purposes.
Attributions such as *"
- Example: "*
without quoted wording are **NOT** treated as quotations and cannot
trigger Q11.

If a quoted sentence contains both alarm **and** de-escalating clauses,
score **Neutral** **unless** one side *clearly outguns* the other –
meaning it deploys a *higher‑precedence cue* **or** ≥ 2 distinct cues
of the same polarity.  Mild "
- Example: "not severe"
- Example: "The virus doesn't just locate in the lungs"
- Example: "yes|no|uncertain"
- Example: "<max 80 tokens, must quote the decisive cue(s) from the text if answering 'yes'. If yes, MUST end with ||FRAME=Alarmist or ||FRAME=Reassuring>"

**CLARIFICATIONS & NOTES:**
- Does a directly quoted source provide a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame?

{"answer":"no","rationale":"Quote has 'concerning' but is balanced by factual counter-statement without explicit reassuring language, resulting in mixed/neutral overall."}
- Primacy of Framed Quotations"?
- Primacy of Framed Quotations (SUPERSEDES PREVIOUS QUOTE RULES)**
- Descriptive vs Amplifying:** Expert descriptions of biological/scientific facts are NEUTRAL unless they use explicit framing language.
- ✗ "The virus doesn't just locate in the lungs" (neutral description)
- ✓ "This is extremely concerning - the virus spreads beyond lungs" (explicit alarm)

**TECHNICAL NOTES:**
- Before deciding that a quoted risk-adjective is Alarmist under Q11,

**SPECIAL RULES:**
- Distance requirement: within 3 characters
- Distance requirement: within 40 characters
- Distance requirement: within 5 characters

# GLOBAL PRECEDENCE RULES

1. **Technical Term Override**: "highly pathogenic (avian) influenza" and "HPAI" are ALWAYS neutral
2. **Containment Override**: Containment verbs neutralize moderate verb patterns unless extreme language used
3. **Mixed Signals**: If both Alarmist and Reassuring cues present → Neutral
4. **Hop Precedence**: Lower hop numbers (Q1-Q4) take precedence over higher ones
5. **Quote Dominance**: Explicit quotes (Q11) can override authorial framing
6. **Uncertainty Cascade**: 3 consecutive "uncertain" → LABEL_UNCERTAIN

---

# UNIVERSAL GUARDS

These apply across ALL patterns:

1. **Source Requirement**: For reassuring cues, speaker must be official/authority or author
2. **Context Requirement**: Cues must relate to the main threat, not background conditions  
3. **Technical Term Guard**: Scientific/medical terminology is neutral unless modified by intensifiers
4. **Distance Requirements**: Respect all character/token distance limits specified in patterns
5. **Adjacency Rules**: Elements must be in same clause when specified
