STEP 2: FRAME DECISION
Based on the cues identified above, now apply the framing logic:

1. If ALARMIST cues are present and no strong REASSURING cues → Alarmist
2. If REASSURING cues are present and no strong ALARMIST cues → Reassuring
3. If both types present, consider dominance and context
4. If only NEUTRAL indicators → Neutral

Remember: The presence of technical terms like "highly pathogenic" does NOT make a segment Alarmist.
