### Question Q4
**Q4: Loaded Rhetorical Question for Alarm**
Does the author or a quoted source pose a loaded rhetorical question that is clearly designed to imply an Alarmist frame, instill fear/urgency, or suggest a worrisome threat (e.g., 'Should consumers worry...?', 'Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?') AND is it distinguishable from a neutral, purely information-seeking question, as detailed in the rules?

**+++ IMPORTANT CALL-OUT: LOADED RHETORICAL QUESTIONS AS ALARMIST CUES +++**
**Direct questions from the author or a quoted source that use explicitly loaded or emotionally charged language designed to imply an Alarmist frame, instill fear/urgency, or suggest a worrisome threat are often strong Alarmist cues.**

**Examples:**
* **Example (Author-driven, implying worry):** Author: "With new variants emerging rapidly, should humans be worried about the next pandemic?" ‚Üí Alarmist (if context suggests framing a worrisome threat).
* **Example (Quote-driven, implying disaster):** 'The activist asked, "Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?"' ‚Üí Alarmist.
* **Critical Distinction:** Carefully distinguish these from neutral, purely information-seeking questions (which are Neutral).

**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**
* Direct questions from the author that use explicitly loaded or emotionally charged language clearly designed to imply an Alarmist frame or instill fear/urgency in the reader.
  * **Example:** **Author:** "With the system collapsing, can anyone truly feel safe anymore?" (Alarmist. Cues: 'system collapsing,' 'truly feel safe anymore?' - rhetorical question implying no).
  * **Non-Example (Neutral):** Author: "What are the safety protocols in place?" (Information-seeking).
* Use of loaded rhetorical questions by the quoted source or author that are designed to evoke fear, urgency, or strong concern by implying a severe problem or a dire lack of action.
  * Example (Author-driven): 'How many more animals have to die before we finally act decisively?' ‚Üí Alarmist. (Rationale: The rhetorical question uses emotive language 'have to die' and implies criticism of inaction, framing the situation as urgent and severe.)
  * Example (Quote-driven): 'The activist asked, "Are we simply going to stand by while this disaster unfolds?"' ‚Üí Alarmist. (Rationale: The quoted rhetorical question uses 'disaster unfolds' to frame the situation alarmingly.)
  * **Example (Rhetorical question from author implying worry):** Author: "With new variants emerging rapidly, should humans be worried about the next pandemic?" ‚Üí Alarmist (if the context suggests this is not a simple information request but a way to frame emerging variants as a worrisome threat).
