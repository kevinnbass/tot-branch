### Question Q9
**Q9: Factual Reporting of Prices/Metrics**
Is the segment primarily reporting prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs (e.g., 'rose,' 'declined,' 'increased,' 'fell') and potentially neutral adverbs (e.g., 'sharply,' 'significantly') BUT WITHOUT employing vivid/potent verbs (e.g., 'skyrocketed,' 'plummeted'), risk adjectives (e.g., 'catastrophic losses'), or other explicit alarmist/reassuring framing language from the author/source, as detailed in the rules for economic language?

**🔍 Q9 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Neutral** |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Standard Economic Verbs** | "prices rose," "costs declined," "rates increased," "values fell" | ✓ |
| **Neutral Adverbs** | "sharply higher," "significantly declined," "notably increased" | ✓ |
| **Factual Quantification** | "decreased by 2%," "gained 15 points," "lost $50M" | ✓ |
| **Volatility adjective** *(mild)* | "prices could become **more volatile**" | ✓ |
| **Vivid Economic Verbs** | "prices skyrocketed," "costs plummeted," "markets crashed" | → Alarmist |
| **Risk Adjectives + Economics** | "catastrophic losses," "devastating decline," "crippling costs" | → Alarmist |

**🔗 See also:** Q2 for high-potency verbs in economic contexts; Q3 for moderate verbs with scale

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Neutral. No → Proceed to Q10.

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Quick Decision Tree ▼** (in main document):
3. **Is it reporting prices or other metrics?** 
   • If verbs like "rose/declined" or adverbs like "sharply" appear **without** a vivid verb or risk adjective → Neutral. 

**##### Economic & Price Language Quick-Reference** (at the end of 2.25.md):
| Phrase (example) | Frame | Rationale |
|------------------|-------|-----------|
| "Prices **soared / skyrocketed**" | Alarmist | vivid verb |
| "Prices **trended sharply higher**" | Neutral | descriptive verb + adverb only |
| "Experts warn prices **could become volatile**" | Neutral | modal + mild adjective |

**Key Principle:** Adverbs such as **sharply, significantly, notably** do **not** raise potency *unless* paired with a vivid verb or risk adjective ("sharply worsening crisis").

**Additional Nuanced Examples** (under Bedrock Principle):
* **Slightly Negative Fact + Neutral Framing:**
  * Segment: "Market prices for wheat decreased by 2% this month."
  * Reasoning: "Neutral. Factual report of a minor negative change. No explicit alarmist framing from the author."
* **Slightly Negative Fact + Alarmist Framing (Exaggeration):**
  * Segment: "Market prices for wheat took a devastating 2% dive this month, spelling trouble for farmers."
  * Reasoning: "Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses 'devastating dive' and 'spelling trouble' to frame a minor decrease alarmingly. Decisive cues: 'devastating dive,' 'spelling trouble'."

**Key Elements for Neutral Economic Reporting:**
- Standard financial/economic terminology
- Descriptive rather than emotive language
- Quantitative focus without editorial amplification
- Professional/technical tone

**Boundary Indicators:**
- **Neutral**: "rose," "declined," "increased," "fell," "dropped," "gained," "lost"
- **Potentially Alarmist**: "soared," "skyrocketed," "plummeted," "crashed," "tanked," "nosedived"
- **Neutral Adverbs**: "sharply," "significantly," "notably," "considerably"
- **Context Matters**: The same adverb can be neutral in economic reporting but contribute to alarmist framing when paired with risk adjectives

> **"Volatile/volatility" policy** – As per v2.16, "volatile" is treated as
> a neutral economic descriptor when paired with modal verbs ("could become
> more volatile") or standard reporting verbs. It is NOT a risk-adjective
> under Q1.

**Regex Pattern (fenced):**
```regex
\b(prices?|rate|cost|loss|profit|revenue|value)\b.*\b(rose|declined|increased|fell|dropped|gained|lost)\b
