### Question Q9
**Q9: Factual Reporting of Prices/Metrics**
Is the segment primarily reporting prices, economic data, or other numerical metrics using standard descriptive verbs (e.g., 'rose,' 'declined,' 'increased,' 'fell') and potentially neutral adverbs (e.g., 'sharply,' 'significantly') BUT WITHOUT employing vivid/potent verbs (e.g., 'skyrocketed,' 'plummeted'), risk adjectives (e.g., 'catastrophic losses'), or other explicit alarmist/reassuring framing language from the author/source, as detailed in the rules for economic language?
