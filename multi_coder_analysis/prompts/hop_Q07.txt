### Question Q7
**Q7: Bare Negation without Explicit Calming Cue**
Does the segment merely state a 'bare negation' (e.g., 'not expected to cause problems,' 'unlikely to affect X,' 'no human cases detected,' 'tests were negative') WITHOUT any accompanying explicit calming cue from the author/source that actively frames this as reassuring about the broader situation, as detailed in the rules?

**üîç Q7 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **‚Üí Neutral** |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Expectation Negations** | "not expected to cause problems," "unlikely to affect consumers," "not anticipated to impact" | ‚úì |
| **Evidence Negations** | "no evidence of transmission," "no human cases detected," "tests were negative" | ‚úì |
| **Risk Negations** | "doesn't pose a risk," "will not impact food supply," "not expected to enter" | ‚úì |
| **Capability Negations** | "viruses do not transmit easily," "cannot survive in," "does not spread through" | ‚úì |
| **Bare Negation + Calming Cue** | "no cases detected, so consumers can be confident," "unlikely to affect supply, keeping risk very low" | ‚Üí Reassuring |

**Outcome:** Yes ‚Üí Label: Neutral. No ‚Üí Proceed to Q8.

**üîç Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Additional problematic phrasings that remain NEUTRAL:**
- "unlikely to affect consumers"
- "no evidence of transmission"  
- "doesn't pose a risk to humans"
- "not expected to cause problems"
- "will not impact food supply"

**Reassurance requires a second clause that explicitly spells out calm/safety.**

**Examples:**
* **Neutral (Bare Negation):** "Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe."
* **Reassuring (Bare Negation + Calming Cue):** "Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe, meaning current health measures remain effective and there's no need for additional public concern."

### Additional example
* "The cases **do not present an immediate public-health concern**." ‚Üí Neutral (bare negation).

**CLARIFICATION** ‚Äì "will **not** enter the food system" and similar bare-negation
statements remain **Neutral** unless followed by an explicit calming cue
(e.g., "‚Ä¶so consumers can rest easy").
