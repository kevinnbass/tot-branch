# YES example
## Input Segment: Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe.
## Question: Does the segment contain a 'bare negation' without explicit calming cue?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"'not expected to be more severe' is a bare negation without additional calming language."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: Officials stated the variant is not expected to be more severe, so there's no need for public concern.
## Question: Does the segment contain a 'bare negation' without explicit calming cue?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'so there's no need for public concern' adds explicit calming cue to the negation."}

### Question Q7
**Q7: Bare Negation without Explicit Calming Cue**
Does the segment merely state a 'bare negation' (e.g., 'not expected to cause problems,' 'unlikely to affect X,' 'no human cases detected,' 'tests were negative') WITHOUT any accompanying explicit calming cue from the author/source that actively frames this as reassuring about the broader situation, as detailed in the rules?

**üîç Q7 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **‚Üí Neutral** |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Expectation Negations** | "not expected to cause problems," "unlikely to affect consumers," "not anticipated to impact" | ‚úì |
| **Evidence Negations** | "no evidence of transmission," "no human cases detected," "tests were negative" | ‚úì |
| **Risk Negations** | "doesn't pose a risk," "will not impact food supply," "not expected to enter" | ‚úì |
| **Capability Negations** | "viruses do not transmit easily," "cannot survive in," "does not spread through" | ‚úì |
| **Bare Negation + Calming Cue** | "no cases detected, so consumers can be confident," "unlikely to affect supply, keeping risk very low" | ‚Üí Reassuring |

**üîó See also:** Q8 for capability statements; Q5-Q6 for explicit reassuring patterns

**Outcome:** Yes ‚Üí Label: Neutral. No ‚Üí Proceed to Q8.

**üîç Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**üö´ RED-FLAG REMINDER ‚Äì Do not reward bare negatives**
"does not expect impact," "no Americans infected," "birds will not enter the food system" are Neutral unless a distinct calming phrase follows (e.g., "so consumers can be confident").

**‚ö†Ô∏è Additional problematic phrasings that remain NEUTRAL:**
- "unlikely to affect consumers"
- "no evidence of transmission"  
- "doesn't pose a risk to humans"
- "not expected to cause problems"
- "will not impact food supply"

**Reassurance requires a second clause that explicitly spells out calm/safety.**

**‚è© 60-Second Cue Cheat-Sheet:**
| If you see‚Ä¶ | Frame | Quick test |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Bare negation** ("not expected", "unlikely to affect") | Neutral | Stays Neutral unless paired with explicit calming cue |

**Common LLM Misinterpretations & How to Avoid Them:**
**NEW (v2.10) - Treating Bare Negations as Reassuring:** Statements like "not expected to cause problems" or "unlikely to affect production" are Neutral unless paired with explicit calming/safety cues (e.g., "so the risk remains low," "meaning consumers can be confident"). The negation alone is insufficient for Reassuring framing.

**NEW - Treating Bare Negations as Reassuring:**
in v2.16.

**Key Principle:** A bare negation simply denies or downplays a risk/problem factually. To become Reassuring, it needs an additional linguistic layer that explicitly interprets this negation as a reason for calm or safety.

**Examples:**
* **Neutral (Bare Negation):** "Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe."
* **Reassuring (Bare Negation + Calming Cue):** "Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe, meaning current health measures remain effective and there's no need for additional public concern."

### Additional example
* "The cases **do not present an immediate public-health concern**." ‚Üí Neutral (bare negation).

**CLARIFICATION** ‚Äì "will **not** enter the food system" and similar bare-negation
statements remain **Neutral** unless followed by an explicit calming cue
(e.g., "‚Ä¶so consumers can rest easy"). This mirrors ¬ßQ7 guidance in v2.16.
