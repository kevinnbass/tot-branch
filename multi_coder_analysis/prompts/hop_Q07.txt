### QUICK DECISION CHECK
‚Ä¢ Sentence shows BARE NEGATION (**NO / NOT / UNLIKELY / POSES NO RISK / NO EVIDENCE / DOES NOT**) **AND** lacks any calming keyword **or optimism adjective** (**welcome / encouraging / heartening / positive / optimistic / upbeat**)?  
‚Üí If yes ‚Üí `"yes"` (Neutral); else ‚Üí `"no"`.

=== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ===
# YES example
## Input Segment: Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe.
## Question: Does the segment contain a 'bare negation' without explicit calming cue?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"'not expected to be more severe' is a bare negation without additional calming language."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: Officials stated the variant is not expected to be more severe, so there's no need for public concern.
## Question: Does the segment contain a 'bare negation' without explicit calming cue?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'so there's no need for public concern' adds explicit calming cue to the negation."}

### Question Q7
**Q7: Bare Negation without Explicit Calming Cue**
Does the segment merely state a 'bare negation' (e.g., 'not expected to cause problems,' 'unlikely to affect X,' 'no human cases detected,' 'tests were negative') WITHOUT any accompanying explicit calming cue from the author/source that actively frames this as reassuring about the broader situation, as detailed in the rules?

**üîç Q7 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **‚Üí Neutral** |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|
<!-- Q7.1 -->
| **Expectation Negations** | "not expected to cause problems," "unlikely to affect consumers," "not anticipated to impact" | ‚úì |
<!-- Q7.2 -->
| **Evidence Negations** | "no evidence of transmission," "no human cases detected," "tests were negative" | ‚úì |
<!-- Q7.3 -->
| **Risk Negations** | "doesn't pose a risk," "will not impact food supply," "not expected to enter" | ‚úì |
<!-- Q7.4 -->
| **Capability Negations** | "viruses do not transmit easily," "cannot survive in," "does not spread through" | ‚úì |
| **Bare Negation + Calming Cue** | "no cases detected, so consumers can be confident," "unlikely to affect supply, keeping risk very low" | ‚Üí Reassuring |

**Outcome:** Yes ‚Üí Label: Neutral. No ‚Üí Proceed to Q8.

**üîç Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Additional problematic phrasings that remain NEUTRAL:**
- "unlikely to affect consumers"
- "no evidence of transmission"  
- "doesn't pose a risk to humans"
- "not expected to cause problems"
- "will not impact food supply"

**Reassurance requires a second clause that explicitly spells out calm/safety.**

**Examples:**
* **Neutral (Bare Negation):** "Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe."
* **Reassuring (Bare Negation + Calming Cue):** "Officials stated the new variant is not expected to be more severe, meaning current health measures remain effective and there's no need for additional public concern."

### Additional example
* "The cases **do not present an immediate public-health concern**." ‚Üí Neutral (bare negation).

**CLARIFICATION** ‚Äì "will **not** enter the food system" and similar bare-negation
statements remain **Neutral** unless followed by an explicit calming cue
(e.g., "‚Ä¶so consumers can rest easy").

**Canonical bare‚Äënegation cheat‚Äësheet (memorise):**  
`poses no risk`, `unlikely to cause`, `no evidence of`, `not expected to`,
`does not affect`, `cannot spread to`, **"does not pose a threat"**

*If you see one of these **and no calming keywords from Q5** ‚Üí answer "yes".*
