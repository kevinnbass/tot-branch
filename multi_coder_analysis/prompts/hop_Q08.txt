### Question Q8
**Q8: Capability/Preparedness Statement without Active Reassurance (Rule C Test)**
Does the segment describe capabilities, preparedness measures, hopeful future possibilities, or implemented safeguards (e.g., 'officials are working to contain,' 'vaccine can be made in X weeks,' 'systems are in place') WITHOUT the author or quoted source explicitly and actively linking these to a state of *current* calm, *present* safety, or *substantially minimized present risk* for the audience, as detailed in Rule C and related guidance?

**🔍 Q8 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Neutral** |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Development Capabilities** | "vaccine can be made in X weeks," "researchers are developing treatments," "antiviral stockpiled" | ✓ |
| **Response Measures** | "officials are working to contain," "systems are in place," "protocols are being followed" | ✓ |
| **Preparedness Statements** | "we have the resources," "plans are ready," "surveillance is ongoing" | ✓ |
| **Future Possibilities** | "restrictions may be short-lived," "situation could improve," "recovery expected" | ✓ |
| **Capability + Active Reassurance** | "stockpiled 30M doses, which is excellent news and means citizens are very well protected," "systems in place, so public can rest easy" | → Reassuring |

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Neutral. No → Proceed to Q9.
