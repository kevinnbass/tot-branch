## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"Quoted source uses 'extremely concerning and requires immediate action' providing dominant alarmist frame. ||FRAME=Alarmist"}

# NO example
## Input Segment: "Meanwhile, Professor MacIntyre described the news as 'concerning,' but noted that avian flu viruses do not transmit easily in humans."
## Question: Does a directly quoted source provide a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame?

### Question Q11 (**Quote-presence hard-guard**)
**Q11: Primacy of Framed Quotations ‚Äì Dominant Quote Check**

Does a directly quoted source within the segment provide a clear, dominant Alarmist or Reassuring frame (per detailed definitions in `step-0-meta-details` and specific frame definitions) that is not overridden or equally balanced by other quotes or strong authorial counter-framing, as per the "Guidance Note: Primacy of Framed Quotations"?

**üîç Q11 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **Outcome** |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Alarmist ‚Äì Dominant Quote** | "extremely concerning and requires immediate action." | **Alarmist** | dominant alarm |
| **Alarmist ‚Äì Intensified High-Risk** | "definitely considered a period of high risk" | **Alarmist** | intensified risk assessment |
| **Neutral ‚Äì Bare risk-adj in quote** | "This virus is deadly to birds." | **Neutral** | base risk adjective without intensifier |
| **Dominant Reassuring Quote** | "no cause for alarm," "excellent news," "very well protected" | ‚Üí Reassuring |
| **Balanced/Mixed Quotes** | "concerning, but viruses do not transmit easily" | ‚Üí Neutral |
| **Neutral Quotes Only** | "officials are monitoring," "tests are ongoing" | ‚Üí Proceed to Q12 |

**üîç Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Guidance Note: Primacy of Framed Quotations (SUPERSEDES PREVIOUS QUOTE RULES)**
**Technical-term override**  
Before deciding that a quoted risk-adjective is Alarmist under Q11,  
**skip** the cue if the adjective is immediately preceded (‚â§ 3 tokens) by the
whitelisted biomedical collocations:  
*"highly pathogenic"*, *"highly pathogenic avian"*, *"HPAI"*.  
Rationale: Q1 technical-term guard has higher precedence and treats these
as neutral taxonomy, not intensification.

**Preparedness safety-link check**  
When a quote says *"fully/well prepared (ready) to handle/deal with ‚Ä¶"* **but** lacks an explicit public/consumer safety link within 40 chars (e.g., "so consumers are safe"), treat it as **Neutral** rather than Reassuring.

Core Principle: If a direct quotation (or a clearly attributed statement from a specific source) within the segment carries a distinct Alarmist or Reassuring frame, the segment's Dim1_Frame MUST reflect the frame of that quotation/attributed statement. This principle applies even if the author's narrative surrounding the quote is Neutral. The frame is determined by the language and tone used by the quoted source itself.

**Regex Pattern:**
```regex
(?ix)

(?<=["'\u2018\u2019\u201C\u201D])

\b(
   (?:
        (?:extremely|highly|very|deeply|incredibly|
           particularly|frighteningly|definitely|certainly|clearly)
        \s+\w{0,3}\s+
        (?:concerning|alarming|worrying|dangerous|
