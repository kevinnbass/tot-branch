## Q6  MINIMISER + DENOMINATOR

Reassuring if a minimiser (only, just, merely, a single …) is **coupled with** an explicit denominator (out of, among, nationwide, %, million …).

Ex Reassuring → "**Only one barn** out of thousands was infected"
Ex Neutral    → "Only three samples were irregular" (no denominator)
