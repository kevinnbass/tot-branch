# YES example
## Input Segment: The region was severely hit by the virus, resulting in record losses.
## Question: Does the author/source use moderate verbs paired with significant scale/impact information?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"'severely hit' with 'record losses' combines moderate verb with explicit large-scale impact."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: The outbreak hit several farms in the area.
## Question: Does the author/source use moderate verbs paired with significant scale/impact information?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'hit several farms' lacks specific scale/impact details to confirm alarmist framing."}

### Question Q3
**Q3: Moderate Verbs + Scale/Impact**
Does the author or a quoted source use a 'moderate verb' (e.g., 'swept across,' 'hard hit,' 'soared,' 'plummeted') AND is this verb explicitly paired with information detailing significant scale or impact (e.g., 'millions culled,' 'record losses,' 'overwhelming systems'), as detailed in the rules?

**🔍 Q3 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Moderate Verb (past-tense)** **+ Scale** | "swept across + millions culled," "hard hit + record losses," "soared + overwhelming systems," | ✓ |
| **Moderate Verb (past-tense)** **+ Quantity** | "surged + 50 % increase," "plummeted + largest decline," "hit + thousands affected" | ✓ |
| **Moderate Verb (present/future/plan)** *(e.g. "**planning to cull**", "could hit")* | → **Neutral** |

**Outcome:** Yes → Label: Alarmist. No → Proceed to Q4.

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Alarmist - Examples:**
* Author: "The region was severely hit by the virus, resulting in record losses." (Alarmist → Author's use of "severely hit" and "record losses" to describe large-scale harm, assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* Author: 'From Wyoming to Maine, the highly contagious bird flu swept across farms and backyard flocks, prompting millions of chickens and turkeys to be culled.' (Alarmist → The author's use of 'swept across' combined with 'highly contagious' and the large-scale consequence 'millions...culled' creates an alarmist depiction of an overwhelming, uncontrolled event, assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* **Example (Evaluative adjective + scale from Author):** Author: "The agricultural sector was hard hit by the drought, with crop yields plummeting by over 50%." (Alarmist → 'Hard hit' coupled with the specific, severe scale of 'plummeting by over 50%' framed by the author).
* **Example (Feared + toll from Author):** Author: "Officials feared a repeat that killed 50 million birds." (Alarmist → 'Feared' (moderate verb) paired with explicit large-scale impact '50 million birds').

**Boundary Requirements:**
1. Verb **must appear in the approved list / regex**.  
2. Must denote realised impact (not a plan or hypothetical).  
3. Plain outcome verbs (*killed, died, affected, reported*) are excluded—Neutral unless other cues fire.
4. Containment verbs (“were/was culled, destroyed, euthanized, depopulated”) are **Neutral even with large numbers** *unless* paired with vivid/emotive language.
5. Sentences about **financial or trade metrics** (exports, imports, sales, production) are treated as factual price/metric reporting → Neutral, not Alarmist here.

**Examples of Scale/Impact Indicators:**
- Numerical quantities: "millions," "thousands," "50%," "record numbers"
- Comparative terms: "largest," "highest," "most severe," "unprecedented"
- Impact descriptors: "overwhelming," "devastating losses," "widespread damage"

> **New aspect guard.** The moderate-verb must denote **realised impact** – NOT merely an intention or hypothetical.  

**Clarification** — Containment actions  
Containment verbs (“were/was culled, destroyed, euthanized, depopulated”) are **Neutral even with large numbers** *unless* the author adds additional vivid or emotive language (e.g., “brutally destroyed 3 million birds”).
