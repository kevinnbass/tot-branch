# YES example
## Input Segment: The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled.
## Question: Does the segment contain an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"yes","rationale":"The intensifier 'so' modifies the risk-adjective 'deadly'."}

# NO example
## Input Segment: A highly pathogenic form of bird flu was detected.
## Question: Does the segment contain an intensifier directly modifying a risk-adjective?
## JSON Output:
{"answer":"no","rationale":"'highly pathogenic' is a technical term, not an authorial intensifier on a general risk-adjective."}

### Segment (StatementID: {{statement_id}})
{{segment_text}}

### Question Q1
**Q1: Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective**
Does the segment feature an intensifier (e.g., 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely') or a comparative adjective (e.g., 'more,' 'deadlier') directly modifying a risk-adjective (e.g., 'deadly,' 'dangerous,' 'severe,' 'catastrophic') as defined in the detailed rules?

**🔍 Q1 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **→ Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Intensifier + Risk-Adj** | "so deadly," "very dangerous," "extremely severe," "highly lethal," "frighteningly contagious" | ✓ |
| **Comparative + Risk-Adj** | "more deadly," "deadlier," "more dangerous," "less safe," "increasingly severe" | ✓ |
| **Fixed Lethal-from-Outset Idiom** | "deadly from the start," "deadly from the outset" | ✓ |
| **Base Risk-Adj (alone)** | "deadly," "dangerous," "severe" (without intensifier) | → Neutral |

**🔍 Detailed Rules & Examples:**
**Outcome when Yes :** Label = Alarmist  
**Outcome when No  :** Return `{ "answer":"no", "rationale": … }`

**‼ RULE 1 QUICK MEMORY HOOK**
• "Highly/very/so/more + deadly/lethal/dangerous" ⇒ Alarmist every time

| If you see… | Frame | Quick test |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Intensifier/Comparative + Risk-Adjective** | Alarmist | **Any single match is sufficient (Precedence #1)** |
| - so/very/extremely/highly/frighteningly/particularly + deadly/lethal/dangerous/brutal/severe/contagious/virulent/destructive **(NOTE "volatile" is handled under Q9)** | | |
| - more/less/deadlier/safer/higher/lower + same risk adjectives | | |
| *(Risk-adjective list is illustrative, not exhaustive)* | | |

**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**
* Authorial use of intensifiers (e.g., 'so,' 'very,' 'extremely,' 'incredibly,' 'particularly,' 'frighteningly') coupled with high-valence negative adjectives (e.g., 'destructive,' 'contagious') to describe the subject or its characteristics. The intensifier must clearly serve to heighten the emotional impact of the negative descriptor, pushing it beyond a factual statement of degree. Example: Author: 'Because the virus is *so deadly* to this species, culling is the only option.' → Alarmist. (Rationale: The intensifier 'so' amplifies 'deadly,' emphasizing the extreme nature and justifying the severe consequence, thereby framing the virus itself in alarming terms.)

**Clarification on "deadly," "fatal," "lethal":** These terms when modified by an intensifier (e.g., 'so deadly,' 'extremely fatal,' 'particularly lethal,' 'frighteningly deadly') are Alarmist. Without such direct intensification, "deadly" (etc.) describing a factual characteristic (e.g., 'Avian flu can be deadly in domestic poultry') is typically Neutral unless other alarmist cues are present.

**Minimal Pair Examples:**
* **Neutral:** "The virus is contagious."
* **Alarmist (Author):** "The virus is frighteningly contagious, spreading like wildfire." (Cue: 'frighteningly,' 'spreading like wildfire').

**Comparative Minimal Pair Example:**
* **Alarmist:** "Scientists warn the virus is becoming deadlier each season."
* **Neutral:** "Scientists track how the virus becomes more common each season."

**⚠ TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL TERMS**  
A term like *deadly, lethal, fatal* **by itself** can still be Neutral when used *clinically* (e.g. "lethal dose 50").  
**BUT** if the same term is paired with *any intensifier or emotive verb* → **Alarmist (Precedence #1)**

**Few-Shot Exemplars:**
| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Alarmist – Intensifier + adjective** | "The flu is so deadly that entire flocks are culled." | **Alarmist** | "so deadly" (intensifier + risk adjective) |
| **Alarmist – Deadly-from-outset idiom** | "H5N1 is deadly from the start, vets warn." | **Alarmist** | "deadly from the start" (fixed lethal-from-outset idiom) |

**Regex Pattern:**
```regex
 \b(?:(?:highly(?!\s+pathogenic\s+avian(?:\s+flu|\s+influenza)?))
     |very|deadlier|more|extremely|severely|so|particularly|frighteningly|definitely|certainly)  
     (?:\s+\w+){0,3}\s+
 (deadly|lethal|dangerous|severe|catastrophic|brutal|contagious|virulent|destructive|infectious|transmissible)\b|
 \bdeadly\s+from\s+(?:the\s+)?(?:start|outset)\b|
 \bmost\s+(?:\w+\s+){0,2}?(?:deadly|destructive|dangerous|severe|catastrophic|devastating|virulent|contagious|lethal)\b
 \b(?:incredibly|unbelievably|increasingly)\s+(?:\w+\s+){0,2}?(?:deadly|dangerous|severe|lethal|catastrophic|virulent|contagious)\b
```

**EXCLUSION — "volatile"**  
When "volatile" modifies *prices/markets/rates* it is treated as an **economic metric** (see Q9) and never triggers Q1.

> **Technical-term guard** – "highly pathogenic" used as part of the formal
> disease name (HPAI) is **Neutral** unless further alarmist cues appear.
