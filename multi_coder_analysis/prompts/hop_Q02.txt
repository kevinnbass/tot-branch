### Question Q2
**Q2: High-Potency Verb/Metaphor**
Does the author or a quoted source employ a high-potency verb (e.g., 'ravaged,' 'skyrocketed,' 'crippling') or a potent metaphor (e.g., 'ticking time-bomb,' 'nightmare scenario') to describe the event or its impacts, where such language actively frames the situation alarmingly, as detailed in the rules?

**üîç Q2 Pattern Recognition Table:**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **‚Üí Alarmist** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **High-Potency Verbs** | "ravaged," "devastated," "skyrocketed," "plummeted," "crashed," "nosedived," "tanked," "crippling," "unleashed," "slaughtered" | ‚úì |
| **Superlative + Negative Noun** | "most expensive disaster," "worst crisis," "record outbreak," "record-breaking catastrophe" | ‚úì |
| **Critical Alert Phrase**(**same sentence must name a threat: outbreak, virus, flu, risk, danger ‚Ä¶**) | "on high alert" (threat can appear **before or after** in ‚â§ 40 chars) | ‚úì |
| **Potent Metaphors** | "ticking time-bomb," "nightmare scenario," "raging inferno," "powder keg," "house of cards" | ‚úì |
| **Moderate Verbs (alone)** | "hit," "swept," "surged" (without scale/impact details) | ‚Üí Neutral |

**Outcome:**
**Outcome when Yes :** Label = Alarmist
**Outcome when No  :** Return `{ "answer":"no", "rationale": ‚Ä¶ }`

**üîç Detailed Rules & Examples:**

**Alarmist - Inclusion Criteria:**
* Authorial use of vivid, active verbs or metaphors to describe the spread or impact of a threat, especially when combined with its scale or severity, thereby emphasizing its uncontrolled, rapid, or overwhelming nature. Example: Author: 'The wildfire swept across the valley, devouring homes and forcing thousands to flee.' ‚Üí Alarmist. (Rationale: 'Swept across' and 'devouring' are vivid, active verbs creating a sense of uncontrolled destructive power.)

**Alarmist - Examples:**
* "The economic impact of the subject on the agricultural sector is a ticking time-bomb for food security," said the analyst. (Alarmist ‚Üí The analyst's quote uses a potent metaphor "ticking time-bomb," framing the economic impact with fear/urgency.)
* Author: "Political inaction is steering us towards a catastrophic crisis related to the subject." (Alarmist ‚Üí Author's framing of political aspect through loaded language like "catastrophic crisis," assuming no overriding framed quote.)
* **Example (Author-driven, vivid metaphor & intensifier):**
  * Author: "The virus is a raging inferno, tearing through populations with terrifying speed, leaving devastation in its wake."
  * Reasoning: "Alarmist (Author-driven). Author uses vivid metaphor 'raging inferno,' 'tearing through,' 'terrifying speed,' and 'devastation in its wake.' Decisive cues: 'raging inferno,' 'terrifying speed'."
* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: "The disease ravaged poultry flocks across three states, leading to immense economic losses." (Alarmist ‚Üí 'Ravaged' + 'across three states' + 'immense economic losses' create a strong alarmist frame).
* **Example (Vivid verb + scale from Author):** Author: "Confirmed cases soared past one million, overwhelming healthcare systems." (Alarmist ‚Üí 'Soared past one million' + 'overwhelming healthcare systems' creates a strong alarmist frame).

**Few-Shot Exemplars:**
| **Category** | **Example Sentence** | **Correct Label** | **Key Cue** |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Alarmist ‚Äì High-potency verb** | "An outbreak ravaged farms across three states." | **Alarmist** | "ravaged" (vivid, destructive verb) |
| **Alarmist ‚Äì Superlative-negative-noun** | "The H5N1 wave is now considered the most expensive animal-health disaster in U.S. history." | **Alarmist** | "most expensive...disaster" (superlative + negative noun) |
| **Alarmist ‚Äì Critical alert phrase** | "State authorities remain on high alert for new cases." | **Alarmist** | "on high alert" (critical alert phrase) |

**Boundary guard:** If the verb is "hit / hitting / swept / surged" but the segment gives no numbers, adjectives or metaphors that convey magnitude, treat it as Neutral. Alarmist fires only when a concrete scale/impact phrase is coupled.

**‚ö† Context caveat for "soaring/soared/soar":**  
Treat "amid **soaring inflation**" or any usage where *soaring* modifies a **background, macro context** (inflation, interest-rates, temperatures, etc.) as **contextual ‚Äî ignore for Alarmist coding**.  
Only count it when the vivid verb modifies a **direct impact noun** of the threat (cases, prices, losses, deaths, production, shortages ‚Ä¶).
