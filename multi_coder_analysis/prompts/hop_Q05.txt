### Question Q5
**Q5: Explicit Calming Cue for Reassurance**
Does the author or a quoted source provide an explicit calming cue (e.g., 'no cause for alarm,' 'public can rest easy,' 'situation is fully contained,' 'excellent news and means citizens are very well protected') that directly communicates current safety, control, or significantly minimized present risk, as detailed in the Reassuring frame criteria?

**üîç Q5 Pattern Recognition Table (expanded):**
| **Pattern Type** | **Examples** | **‚Üí Reassuring** |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Direct Safety Assurances** | "no cause for alarm," "public can rest easy," "completely safe," "fully under control" | ‚úì |
| **Confidence Statements** | "we are confident," "rest assured," "situation contained," "providing relief" | ‚úì |
| **Direct Consumption Safety** | "safe to eat," "safe for (human) consumption," "remains safe to eat" | ‚úì |
| **‚ö† The clause must contain the literal word "safe".** <br>Expressions that merely say something "should not pose a risk / danger" **do not count** here and must fall through to **Q7 ‚Äì Bare Negation.** |   |
| **Preparedness Calming Cue**<br/>(official source **and** explicit public‚Äësafety link) | "fully prepared to handle," "well prepared for," "ready to deal with" | ‚úì |
| **Low‚ÄëRisk Evaluation (+ Intensifier)** | "**risk is *very* low**," "chance remains extremely low," "likelihood is exceptionally low" | ‚úì |
| **Positive Amplification** | "excellent news," "very well protected," "wonderfully high," "thankfully reached" | ‚úì |
| **Bare Positive Facts** | "no cases reported," "tests negative," "no problems detected" | ‚Üí Neutral (unless paired with calming cue) |
| **"Fortunately for consumers ‚Ä¶" cue** | "Fortunately for consumers ‚Ä¶" | ‚úì |

**Outcome:** Yes ‚Üí Label: Reassuring. No ‚Üí Proceed to Q6.

**‚è© 60-Second Cue Cheat-Sheet:**
| If you see‚Ä¶ | Frame | Quick test |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Explicit calming cue** ("no cause for alarm", "public can rest easy") | Reassuring | Direct statement of *current* safety |
| **Calming idiom: fully/well prepared to handle** | Reassuring | Speaker-guarded (official/author) |

**Definition: Reassuring** (Key Elements)
Statement, either through a directly quoted source or the author's own presentation, demonstrably employs explicit language, tone, or rhetorical devices specifically chosen by the author or quoted source to actively calm audience concerns, minimize perceived current risk, emphasize safety/control, or highlight positive aspects in a way designed to reduce worry regarding the subject or its impacts. The intent to reassure must be evident in the presentation, not inferred from the facts being merely positive.

**Key Differentiators from Neutral:**
* Neutral reports positive facts; Reassuring adds explicit calming / optimistic amplification **or an intensified *low-risk* judgement about *current human safety*.**
* Neutral uses standard descriptive terms for positive outcomes; Reassuring frames them with active confidence or relief.
* Neutral may state a low risk; **Reassuring explicitly highlights the *very/exceptionally low* risk level to calm the audience.**
* Neutral reports solutions/capabilities; Reassuring links them **directly to present safety for the public/consumers** *or* comes from a recognised public authority.

**Inclusion Criteria (Reassuring):**
* A directly quoted source **or the author** uses explicit calming language **or** an *intensified low-risk evaluation* ("risk is **very low** for humans") that clearly signals current safety/minimised danger.
* Statements that not only report positive facts but also explicitly frame these facts as reasons for reduced concern or increased confidence about safety or control.
  * **Example:** "Vaccination rates have thankfully reached 80% in the target population, a wonderfully high figure that provides excellent protection and means the community is now much safer." (Reassuring. Cues: 'thankfully,' 'wonderfully high,' 'excellent protection,' 'much safer').
* Direct assurances of safety, control, or manageability from the author or a quoted source.
  * **Example:** "Quote: 'We have stockpiled 30 million doses of the antiviral, which is excellent news and means our citizens are very well protected against any immediate threat from this virus.'" (Reassuring. Cues: 'excellent news,' 'very well protected').
**Preparedness cues fire only when BOTH conditions hold (strict guard):**
1. *Speaker is a government or public‚Äëhealth authority* **AND**  
2. *Capability phrase links explicitly to present public/consumer safety* (‚â§ 40 chars span) ("‚Ä¶so the public can rest easy", "‚Ä¶meaning consumers are protected").  
Superlative boasts alone ("strongest surveillance program") are Neutral.  
Corporate self-statements lacking a safety link stay Neutral.  
  * **Example (Neutral):** "Tyson Foods is prepared for situations like this and has robust plans in place."

**Minimal Pair Examples for Reassuring vs. Neutral:**
* **Neutral:** "The latest tests on the water supply showed no contaminants."
  * Reasoning: "Reports absence of negative. No explicit reassuring language from the author/source about broader safety."
* **Reassuring:** "Officials confirmed the latest tests on the water supply showed no contaminants, declaring, 'This is excellent news, and residents can be fully confident in the safety of their drinking water.'"
  * Reasoning: "The official's quote explicitly frames the negative test as 'excellent news' and a reason for 'full confidence' and 'safety.' Decisive cues: 'excellent news,' 'fully confident in the safety'."

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Exclusion:**
* **Neutral (NOT Reassuring):** "The cases do not present an immediate public-health concern, the agency said."
  * Reasoning: "This is a bare negation statement without additional calming amplification."
