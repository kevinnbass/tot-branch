# ToT Pipeline Upgrade to v2.16 - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the three precision upgrades to upgrade the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) pipeline to version 2.16.

## âœ… Upgrades Applied

### 1. Context Guard for Vivid Language
**File:** `prompts/global_header.txt`
**Purpose:** Prevents background context from triggering Alarmist coding
**Implementation:**
```
## Context guard for vivid language (v 2.16)
> A vivid verb/adjective that colours a **background condition**  
> (e.g. "amid **soaring** inflation", "during a **plunging** market")  
> is **ignored** for Alarmist coding.  
> Alarmist cues fire only when the vivid language depicts the threat's
> **own realised impact** (cases, deaths, prices, losses, shortages, etc.).
```

### 2. Refuse-to-Label Protocol  
**File:** `prompts/GLOBAL_FOOTER.txt`
**Purpose:** Allows model to return "Unknown" when uncertain
**Implementation:**
```
# 7. If you reach **Q12** and still cannot assign a frame with certainty,
#    return an **Unknown** label:
#        { "answer":"unknown",
#          "rationale":"Q12 reached with no decisive cues; frame unresolved" }
#    Down-stream evaluation will skip these rows.
```

### 3. Unknown Option in Q12
**File:** `prompts/hop_Q12.txt`  
**Purpose:** Makes "unknown" a legal JSON response value
**Implementation:**
```json
{
  "answer": "yes|no|uncertain|unknown",
  "rationale": "<max 80 tokens, explaining why no explicit framing cues remain and facts are presented neutrally>"
}
```

## âœ… Evaluation System Updates

### Updated Metrics Calculation
**File:** `run_multi_coder_tot.py`
**Purpose:** Exclude "Unknown" labels from accuracy calculations
**Key Changes:**
- Filter out predictions with `p.lower() != "unknown"` 
- Calculate metrics only on definitively labeled samples
- Track excluded count for reporting
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Enhanced Reporting
**Purpose:** Show transparency about Unknown exclusions
**Features:**
- Reports excluded Unknown count
- Shows evaluated vs total sample counts
- Maintains existing accuracy metrics format

## âœ… Testing Results

### Pipeline Compatibility  
- âœ… Successfully processes existing test cases
- âœ… ToT chain execution uninterrupted  
- âœ… JSON parsing handles new "unknown" option
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Concatenation System
- âœ… All prompt files include v2.16 upgrades
- âœ… Footer appears in all 12 hop prompts
- âœ… File size increased appropriately (~82KB â†’ ~87KB)

## ðŸ“Š Implementation Impact

### File Changes Summary:
- `global_header.txt`: Added context guard (6 lines)
- `GLOBAL_FOOTER.txt`: Added Unknown protocol (5 lines)  
- `hop_Q12.txt`: Updated JSON schema (1 line)
- `run_multi_coder_tot.py`: Enhanced evaluation logic (~30 lines)

### Backward Compatibility:
- âœ… Existing gold standard data unchanged
- âœ… Previous model outputs still evaluable
- âœ… No breaking changes to API or file formats

## ðŸš€ Production Readiness

### Ready for Use:
- All upgrades tested and functional
- Evaluation system handles Unknown labels gracefully
- Pipeline maintains full ToT decision tree integrity
- Concatenation system automatically includes all upgrades

### Usage:
```bash
python main.py --use-tot [--limit N] [--concurrency N]
```

The v2.16 upgrade maintains full pipeline functionality while adding sophisticated uncertainty handling and context sensitivity for more accurate claim framing analysis.
